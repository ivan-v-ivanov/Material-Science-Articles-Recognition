0,Ultra rapid biosensors for detecting carcinoma biomarkers,2022-02-01,"Preliminary screening and successful therapy are the two biggest challenges in the battle against cancer prognosis and diagnosis. This life-threatening disease can be profoundly imagined and identified based on the tracing of widely eliciting/expressing protein biomarkers in the biological fluids of an individual. These protein biomarker may fall into broad categories based on the types of tissues or organs being involved and are commonly known as onco-biomarkers or tumor markers. Indicators of cancer are routinely detected using a myriad of developing bio-sensing tools for point of care diagnostics that have really been proven to be an effective solution for early-stage cancer. Modern and advanced approaches offer great advantages over the use of traditional assessment therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and combinations, of all but display several noticeable drawbacks in that they are time-consuming, hard to use, skilled labour-intensive, costly, less efficient, less sensitive, require more analysis time, and are often not up to the mark. Recently, various bio-sensing approaches have drawn special attention toward on-site screening and real-time detection of critical protein biomarkers. This review provides an insightful overview of current advances made in sensing techniques used for detecting biomarkers for various types of carcinomas. Various sensing methodologies and tools used for the detection of each biomarker have been thoroughly reviewed. Every one of these processes indicates that multifaceted innovation-based tumor diagnostics are becoming an indisputable substitute for conventional strategies."
1,Current role and future perspectives of chemometrics in spectroscopic and chromatographic analysis of traditional Chinese medicines,2022-02-01,"Recently, Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs), having a rich history in China for their use in maintaining health and treating disease, have gained popularity worldwide. However, their modernization and globalization are impeded due to their “multi-component, multi-pathway, and multi-target” properties. Chemometrics, a comprehensive product of statistics, computers, and information, is an interfacial discipline that extracts practical information from large chemical and biochemical datasets, beneficial to overcome TCMs restrictions. This review summarized key research findings on the basis and application of TCMs according to their components, authenticity, processing conditions, geographical origin, pharmacological activity, and metabolomics based on recent studies. Here, we discussed the benefits and shortcomings of cluster analysis, principal component analysis, soft independent modeling of class analogy, artificial neural networks, support vector machine, partial least squares-discriminant analysis, data fusion and calibration, and the appropriate application of these methods in different fields of TCMs. This review aimed to provide a basic understanding of the role and perspectives of chemometrics in the spectroscopic and chromatographic analysis of TCMs."
2,Function of calcium-rich hydroxyapatite nanoparticles on proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in osteoporosis,2022-02-01,"Out study was aimed to assess the function of calcium-rich hydroxyapatite nanoparticles on proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in osteoporosis. The structure of calciumrich hydroxyapatite nanoparticles was tested with Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cell proliferation was detected with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. The activity of Caspase3 was detected with ELISA and content of alkaline phosphatase (AP), osteopontin (OPN) and Runx2 was tested with Western Blot assay. The bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) proliferation was prompted by calcium-rich hydroxyapatite. Results showed that the activity of ALP was increased, while activity of Caspase3 was reduced. The expression levels of OPN and Runx2 were increased while expression of Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) osteogenesis marker was increased. Moreover, the BMSCs could be differentiated effectively onto osteogenic direction, and proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs was prompted effectively by calcium-rich hydroxyapatite. These findings could probably provide a brand-new scheme for clinical treatment of OP."
3,Mechanism of 5-fluorouracil nanoparticles on releasing skin squamous cell carcinoma through regulation of Wnt/-catenin expression,2022-02-01,"5-FU nanoparticles were prepared in this study to discuss mechanism of 5-fluorouracil nanoparticles on releasing SSCC through regulating Wnt/β-catenin expression. The characteristics of nanomaterial were analyzed through electron microscope. The releasing characteristics in vitro and in vivo were also detected. Proliferation and apoptosis of SCC cell line in control and 5-FU nanoparticles groups were detected through FCM and MTT method. The tumor volume was recorded and average particle size was 310 nm with uni-form distribution. The apoptosis of MCF-7 cells in the 5-FU nanoparticles group was increased notably, and there were abundant circular floating apoptotic cells. The quantity of active MCF-7 cells was reduced notably and proliferation of SSCC could be restrained by 5-FU nanoparticles through regulation of Wnt/β-catenin expression."
4,Mechanism of poly(lactic acid-glycolic acid) (PLGA) copolymer nanoparticles in enhancing cytotoxicity against occurrence and development of lung cancer metastasis,2022-02-01,"Poly lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer (PLGA) plays a critical role in inducing tumor cells apoptosis. However, the solubility of the compound itself puts a limit on its use value in treatment of tumor. In this study, we used PLGA combined with nanoparticles as a strategy for metastatic tumor of lung cancer. We evaluated the biological effect of PLGA nanoparticles on enhancing cytotoxicity and its anti-tumor effect against metastasis tumor of lung cancer. Confocal microscope was used to detect the transfection efficiency of tumor cells. PLGA and PLGA-cored nanoparticles (PLGA AC-NPs) were used to interfere with proliferation and apoptosis of metastatic tumor cell line from lung cancer and flow cytometry was used to explore its effect. Furthermore, PLGA and PLGA AC-NPs were injected into the chest of lung cancer mice for treatment. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected through measurement of tumor volume, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Westernblot protein analysis. It was found that, PLGA AC-NPs significantly enhanced cell uptake while PLGA ACNPs regulated tumor by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis. It was also observed in vivo transplanted tumor model that the growth of metastatic tumor of lung cancer was inhibited significantly by NGO-PEG-PEI/Cer, while proliferation and accelerated apoptosis were also slowed down. PLGA AC-NPs can inhibit tumor growth by promoting apoptosis and inhibiting further proliferation of tumor cells."
5,Extracts from lichen  decrease the stemness potential of colorectal cancer cells,2022-02-01,"Lichens are symbiotic organisms with the potential to be used in the pharmaceutical industry. To identify novel lichen extracts that inhibit the stemness potential of colorectal cancer cells, we tested acetone extracts of Lobaria retigera collected in Vietnam. Crude acetone extracts of L. retigera decreased spheroid formation in CSC221, DLD1, and HT29 cells. In addition, mRNA levels of genes encoding cancer stem markers aldehyde dehydrogenase-1, CD44, CD133, Lgr5, and Musashi-1 were significantly downregulated in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with L. retigera extract. Moreover, L. retigera extract decreased the transcriptional activities of Gli and the Notch-related Hes1 promoter in reporter assays. Together, these results demonstrate that L. retigera extract is a potent inhibitor of colorectal cancer cell stemness."
6,"Arginine and chitosan modified magnetic nanoparticles in ciprofloxacin delivery: A comparative, characterization and  release study",2022-02-01,"Recently, magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) have become great potential nanocarriers for drugs and biomaterials. Chitosan (Chi) and Arginine (Arg) were utilized to coat magnetite nanoparticles to produce Chi-IONPs and Arg-IONPs. The preparation Chi-IONPs and Arg-IONPs was carried out by a two-step process. Initially, magnetite (Fe3O4) was prepared from Fe+2 and Fe+3 ions which were added into a solution of soda by a co-precipitation method. In the second step, prepared IONPs were coated with Chi and Arg polymers. The Chi-IONPs and Arg-IONPs were then conjugated with ciprofloxacin (Cip) to produce Cip-Chi-IONPs and Cip-Arg-IONPs nanocomposites. Characterization was performed using X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Zeta Potential determination, vibrating-sample magnetometery (VSM), UV-Vis spectroscopy and cytotoxicity. From the XRD, the plane (311) of magnetic nanoparticles remained without shift, indicating that they remained in the structure as the core of the carrier. The Chi and Arg polymers bound to IONPs were estimated by calculating the difference in weight loss by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The loading of Cip to the IONPs was confirmed by FTIR analysis. The percent loading of Cip onto the Chi-IONPs and Arg-IONPs was measured using UV-Vis spectroscopy, and found to be around 15% and 9%, respectively. The size of Cip-Chi-IONPs and Cip-Arg-IONPs nanocomposites were ~13 nm, which was measured by TEM. From the VSM experiment, the Ms saturation value for IONPs, Cip-Chi-IONPs and Cip-Arg-IONPs was 79 emu/g, 38 emu/g, and 26 emu/g, respectively, and field coercivity (Hc) for each was each 7.37, 16.12 and 13.69 Gauss, respectively. In the release study, Cip-Arg-IONPs demonstrated a faster rate of release compared with Cip-Chi-IONPs and followed a second order kinetic mode with diffusion mechanism. In the cytotoxicity study for Cip-Chi-IONPs and Cip-Arg-IONPs nanocomposites, the results showed that there were no toxic properties up to 100 μg/mL. This work showed that the development of Cip-Chi-IONPs and Cip-Arg-IONPs nanocomposites have a great potential for use as drug delivery systems."
7,Toxic effect of silica nanoparticles on bronchial epithelial cells,2022-02-01,"Nanometer silica dioxide (nano-SiO2) is a widely utilized material in everyday applications; however, it exhibits toxic side effects on the human body. This study aims to provide reliable research basis for theoretical guidance in mitigating the toxic effects of nano-SiO2 in future applications by analyzing the mechanism of its effect on bronchial epithelial cells. In this experiment, under nano-SiO2 intervention, the proliferation and migration capacities of bronchial epithelial cells decreased (P < 0.05); apoptosis capacity increased (P < 0.05); the P13K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was inhibited (P < 0.05), and the oxidative stress reaction and inflammatory response was intensified (P < 0.05). Thus, we can tentatively infer that nano-SiO2 causes apoptosis of the bronchial epithelial cells by inhibiting the P13K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and accelerates the activation of oxidative stress, thus leading to toxic effects on bronchial epithelial cells."
8,Clinical implications of miR-424 in diabetic retinopathy and its correlation with inflammatory cytokines,2022-02-01,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) that can result in low vision or blindness, severely threatening the quality of life of patients. Because of the aberrant expression of miR-424 in DM and its close association with cataracts, we aimed to analyze the clinical implications of miR-424 in DR. We found that miR-424 levels were lower in DR than DM patients (P < 0.05), and they increased after treatment (P < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated a reliable diagnostic value of miR-424, and levels of inflammatory cytokines were elevated in DR patients and suppressed after treatment (P < 0.05). Correlation analyses indicated an inverse association between these cytokines and miR-424 in the observation group after treatment. Moreover, miR-424 was highly predictive of the prognosis and recurrence of DR. Additionally, miR-424 was an independent protective factor for DM, as shown by logistic regression. Overall, it is concluded that the low expression of miR-424 in DR is inversely associated with inflammatory cytokines, which could be excellent potential candidates for the diagnosis and treatment of DR."
9,Carbon dots with tunable emission based on pH values,2022-02-01,"Fluorescent carbon dots are the hot topic of fluorescent nanomaterials due to their outstanding optical properties and promising practical application. However, the drawback of fluorescent carbon dots that their strong emission frequently in the blue-light region restricts their further applications. Here, fluorescent carbon dots with tunable emission were synthesized through a simple, rapid and low-cost chemical thermal treatment method. The fluorescent carbon dots emit bright green, yellow and orange fluorescence with different pH value. This is due to the combined effect of size and surface states of fluorescent carbon dots. Further studies show that the fluorescent carbon dots possess intrinsic horseradish peroxidase-like activity and were successfully applied to directly detect Cr3+."
10,Upgrade of heavy crude oil via aquathermolysis over several types of catalysts,2022-02-01,"A solid NaY zeolite catalyst was synthesized from raw materials using a hydrothermal method. The NH4Y and HY forms of the catalyst were then prepared using multistage ion-exchange and calcination processes, respectively. Cobalt and Zinc as transition metals were loaded into the HY structure through impregnation method. The synthesized Zn/HY and Co/HY zeolites along with ZnO and CoO nanoparticles were all used as catalysts for aquathermolysis. The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area and pore volume analysis. A stainless-steel autoclave operated at 45 bar and 250 °C for 24 h was employed for upgrading heavy crude oil samples extracted from the East Baghdad oilfield using toluene as the hydrogen donor. The reaction products were analyzed by evaluating the changes in their viscosity, API gravity, density, pour point, and flash point. The results indicated that the efficiency of the catalysts decreased as follows: Zn/HY zeolite > Co/HY zeolite > nano CoO > nano ZnO > HY zeolite > in the presence of the hydrogen donor only = in the absence of catalysts or the hydrogen donor. The decrease in the S-content of the products was also evaluated. The results indicated that the efficiency of the catalysts decreased as follows: Co/HY zeolite > Zn/HY zeolite > nano CoO > nano ZnO > HY zeolite > in the presence of the hydrogen donor only > in the absence of catalysts or the hydrogen donor. The S-content of the products obtained over the Co/HY zeolite catalyst decreased the most (by 65.63%). Moreover, the viscosity of the crude oil obtained over the Zn/HY zeolite catalyst decreased the most (by 63.69%)."
11,Quantized molecular intercalations of Rhodamine 6G laser dye onto polymethylmethacrylate host exciplex,2022-02-01,"Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and Rhodamine 6G (R6G), were used to achieve an electronically excited R6G/PMMA complex of definite stoichiometry as an active laser exciplex, pumped by different laser sources. This paper is the first that is capable of interpretation of the interactions of the reactants to form the exciplex on the molecular level using DFT. The system was prepared by thermochemical polymerization, and structurally identified using FTIR, XRD and SEM in conjunction with DSC. In low-to moderate-loading of R6G, FTIR and XRD studies indicated a good interaction between PMMA and R6G to give poor-or semi-crystalline structures. Higher dye loadings were achieved for the synthesized exciplex; loading of PMMA with 0.25 Wt-% R6G decreased the glass transition temperature from 98.74 °C to 70.08 °C. However, increasing the loading with R6G to 5 Wt-% and 20 Wt-% increased the Tg values to 86.26 and 91.90 °C, respectively. MD simulations were conducted; the electronic mobility within the system was related to different quantum parameters, EHOMO, ELUMO, η, μ and ω were about -7.671 eV, -5.241 eV, 1.215 eV, -6.456 eV and 17.1522 eV, respectively. DFT calculations indicated that R6G/PMMA has a characteristic lasing stability, so that the lasing lifetimes about 8000 pulses and efficiencies about 21% were obtained."
12,Effect of graphene oxide on the performance of foamed concrete and its action mechanism in cement,2022-02-01,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of graphene oxide (GO) on the performance of foamed concrete and its action mechanism in cement. The GO increased the nine-day and 15-day compressive and flexural strengths of foamed concrete compared to concrete without GO. When the GO dispersion (GOd) content was 0.75% (by the cement weight), the 15-day compressive strength of the foamed concrete increased by 36.36%. However, excess GO adversely affected the late-age compressive strength (30 days) because it was difficult to disperse uniformly in cement. The microstructure and hydration products of the foamed concrete were analysed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy combined (FEM) with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy techniques (EDS). The GO could regulate the shape of hydration products, probably because GO exhibited a strong covalent bond between the oxygen-containing functional groups of GO and the cement hydration products, and the GO content and curing age influenced such regulations. The pore structure was examined using X-ray computed tomography, (X-CT) and the GO significantly influenced the pore structure of the foamed concrete. The findings of this study indicate that GO has potential as a nanometre-sized material to improve the strength of foamed concrete without affecting the dry density."
13,Effect of microstructure on complex permittivity and microwave absorption properties of recycled -FeO nanopowder prepared by high-energy ball milling technique,2022-02-01,"This study was aimed at investigating the effect of microstructural variations on relative complex permittivity and microwave absorption properties of recycled α-Fe2O3, following application of high-energy ball milling technique to modify particles into nanopowder. Three portions of recycled α-Fe2O3 granules were separately milled for 8 h, 10 h and 12 h respectively and their microstructural characteristics were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. This was followed by relative complex permittivity and microwave absorption characterizations which were conducted at X-band microwave frequency range using the rectangular waveguide technique in connection with a vector network analyzer. Results established interfacial lattice defects and imperfections in the milled portions which became more pronounced with reduced crystallite sizes, and contributed to enhanced interfacial polarization process, leading to increased relative complex permittivity and microwave absorption properties of the recycled α-Fe2O3 nanopowders. The smallest estimated crystallite size of 11.1 nm was obtained after 12 h of milling with ɛ r = 12.1–0.46j at 8 GHz, which was reduced to ɛ r = 11.0–0.34j at 12 GHz while its power loss values varied between 18.3 dB and 23.3 dB in the 8–12 GHz range. A positive correlation was identified that connects microstructural variations with relative complex permittivity and power loss, and could be exploited to tune the microwave absorption properties of the recycled α-Fe2O3 particles."
14,Autonomous damage recognition of C/SiC composite based on transfer learning,2022-02-01,"C/SiC composite has excellent performance, but their damage patterns cannot be effectively detected, and it is tough to obtain a large amount of label data. Therefore, an autonomous damage image recognition based on transfer learning is proposed in this paper. A C/SiC composite damage image data set is collected from experiments and papers, including fiber pullout, matrix cracking, interface debonding, and fiber breakage images. Pre-trained DenseNet121 was transferred to train and classify this data set. Pre-trained AlexNet and other four networks are selected for comparison. The results of experiment illustrate that the accuracy of directly using the DenseNet121 model is 70.536%, and the accuracy of the transferring pre-trained AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet18, and MobileNet-v2 on the validation set is 96.429%, 84.598%, 94.420%, 94.866%, respectively. The accuracy in this paper is 97.098%. As the number of damage images of C/SiC composite is limited, the recognition accuracy of the method is significantly improved."
15,N/O dual-doped hierarchical porous carbon boosting cathode performance of lithium—sulfur batteries,2022-02-01,"A combination of NaOH activation and continuous pyrolysis of biomass is used to prepare N and O dual-doped hierarchical porous carbon as the carrier of Li—S batteries from egg, yolk and albumen respectively. Among the three sources, the biomass porous carbon derived from albumen has the most abundant hierarchical pore morphology. Its specific surface area, average pore diameter, and sulfur loading are 693.0 m2 · g−1, 3.1 nm and 62.0 wt.%, respectively. The albumen-derived porous carbon/sulfur (AC/S) electrode exhibits excellent reversibility and electrochemical performance (1115 mAh · g−1 at 0.05 C) due to the synergistic effect of hierarchical pore structure and element doping. The rate capacity of AC/S is 15% and 25% higher than that of egg-derived porous carbon/sulfur (EC/S) and yolk-derived carbon/sulfur (YC/S) at 2 C. And the capacity retention rate of AC/S after 50 cycles is 77%, which is 15% and 11% higher than those of EC/S and YC/S, respectively."
16,Effect of carbon addition on dissolution behavior of aluminum alloy sacrificial anode,2022-02-01,"Using potentiodynamic polarization and immersion corrosion and sacrificial anode material discharge performance testing methods studied the dissolution behavior of aluminum anode material in the working condition of simulated Northwest oilfield corrosion conditions. The research results show that carbon can reduce the corrosion potential of aluminum anode material and anode current density increase, which can improve the material corrosion dissolution performance. Immersion corrosion test results show that with the carbon content in ascension, to enhance the anode material of aluminum anode material of uniform dissolving ability, passivation phenomenon was significantly suppressed. Adding carbon anode materials to add up the uniform’s ability to dissolve, eliminate the phenomenon of local corrosion of anode material and the discharge efficiency is greatly increased, effectively solve the aluminum anode material in high temperature environment to serve the current efficiency degradation of field engineering problems."
17,Effect of rapid cold stamping on the precipitation and mechanical properties of Al–Cu–Mg alloy,2022-02-01,"High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and tensile tests were used to investigate the effects of rapid cold stamping deformation on the precipitation and mechanical properties of spray-formed fine-grained Al–Cu–Mg alloy during aging. The number of longplate S′ phases in peak-aged samples evidently increases with increasing number of rapid cold stamping passes. After two passes of rapid cold stamping, the distribution of long-plate S′ phases in the samples is evidently uneven, with high density in some areas and low density in some areas. The S′ phases are refined, the number is further increased, and the distribution is uniform after four passes of rapid cold stamping deformation. The overall performance of the material is excellent. The tensile strength, yield strength, and elongation are 512 MPa, 453 MPa, and 11.2%, respectively."
18,Curcumin regulates glial cell polarization through TLR4/NF-B pathway after intracerebral hemorrhage,2022-02-01,"This study assessed the effect of curcumin on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) to provide a theoretical basis for treatment of ICH. C57BL/6 male mice were used to construct cerebral hemorrhage injury model, and sham operation and treatment groups were set up. Different groups of mice were treated with curcumin, and inflammation cytokines were tested with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Tunel staining and Nissl staining measured cell apoptosis in brain tissue. The effect of curcumin on polarization of glial cells was studied by immunofluorescence. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting analyzed the potential mechanism for curcumin’s effect on ICH. Our results showed that the curcumin effectively inhibited inflammatory response and reduced microglia cell apoptosis in intracerebral hemorrhage model. Additionally, curcumin transformed the M1 into M2 cells in the brain of cerebral hemorrhage model mice, thus improving the neurological damage. Additionally, curcumin exerts anti-inflammatory role in cerebral hemorrhage which was related to toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (TLR4/NF-κB) pathway. We found that curcumin reduced inflammatory response and brain tissue cell death in the ICH mouse model, mainly through TLR4/NF-κB pathway, to change glial cell polarization. The findings from this study will be helpful in promoting development and application of curcumin and providing a theoretical basis for the treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage."
19,Effect of strain on the formation of Guinier—Preston zone in Al—Cu alloys from first-principles,2022-02-01,"Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the energetics of Guinier—Preston zone (GPZ) formation in response to external strain in the Al—Cu system. The results show that when the applied strain exceeds a certain threshold, the precipitation of the GPZ preferentially occurs parallel (perpendicular) to the direction of tensile (compressive) strain and the precipitation energy of the GPZ has a parabolic relationship with the magnitude of strain. The variation of precipitation energy is related to the misfit of the GPZ with the matrix, which changes the number of bonding electrons below the Fermi level."

Analysis of variance, i.e., One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test were used to explore the data (P < 0.05). A statistically significant difference between cement type and the time point was observed (p = 0.000). Furthermore, time duration had a significant effect on the Δ? value (p = 0.001). Moreover, the interaction effect of the cement type and time had a significant effect on the Δ? value (p = 0.000). There is an obvious consequence of luting resin cement shade used on the shade of pressed ceramics. Time is an essential factor that affects and influence luting resin cement shade on the final color of the prosthesis."
23,Nanomaterial-based gas sensors: A review on experimental and theoretical studies,2022-01-01,"Gas sensors play an essential role in various fields such as public safety, environmental monitoring, medical engineering, food monitoring, pharmaceutical industries and clinical diagnostic, to name a few. The need for miniaturized sensors possessing high sensitivity, time response, selectivity, reproducibility, durability, and low cost has driven the discovery of nanomaterials-based gas sensing devices due to their inherent properties such as chemical/physical gas adsorption capabilities and high surface-to-volume ratio. Studies in the literature highlight the development of gas sensors using novel nanomaterials to detect toxic gases. The gas molecules are sensed by the nanomaterial due to adsorption of the gas on the sensor surface, which leads to conductivity change in the nanomaterial.

25,Liposomal nanoparticle-based miR-155 antagonist regulates Th17/Treg signaling pathway and its inhibitory effect against myocarditis,2022-01-01,"Abnormal expression of miR-155 is related to degree of myocardial fibrosis in myocarditis. This study mainly explored the role of miR-155 in myocardial fibrosis and possible mechanisms. Forty Balb/c mice were randomly separated into blank group, model group, miR-155 group, and DMSO group (n = 10). Fibrosis area and expression of TGF-β and α-SMA in each group were observed. Fibroblasts were then isolated and miR-155mRNA expression, expression of Collagen I, α-SMA, Th17 cell number, Treg cell number, and expressions of IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, STAT3, RORγt, and Foxp3 were also investigated. The model group and DMSO group had the highest fibrosis area, while the blank group and miR-155 group had the lowest fibrosis area. However, the fibrosis area for miR-155 group was higher than the blank group (P >0.05). No significant difference was found between model group and DMSO group (P >0.05). Compared to blank and miR-155 groups, expressions of TGF-β and α-SMA in the model and DMSO group were significantly up-regulated (P <0.05). No significant difference was found between the model and DMSO groups, or between blank and miR-155 groups P < 0.05). Compared to blank and miR-155 groups, the levels of Collagen I, α-SMA, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, STAT3, RORγt, and Foxp3 in the model and DMSO groups were significantly up-regulated (P > 0.05). No significant difference was found between model and DMSO groups, or between blank and miR-155 groups (P < 0.05). The number of Th17 cells was significantly increased, while Treg cells were significantly decreased in the model and DMSO groups (P < 0.05). In contrast, Th17 cells were significantly decreased, while Treg cells were significantly increased in the blank and miR-155 groups (P < 0.05). No significant difference was found between the model and DMSO groups, or between blank and miR-155 groups (P < 0.05). Moreover, miR-155 inhibited myocarditis and myocardial fibrosis. The mechanism is mainly related to Th17/Treg signaling pathway, where miR-155 decreased Th17 cells, increased Treg cells, inhibited the secretion of Collagen I and α-SMA, and reduced the levels of fibroblast molecules. The miR-155 also interacted with STAT3 pathway to stimulate the activity of inflammatory cells, inhibit the secretion of inflammatory factors, further improving the inflammatory response of myocarditis, and ultimately improving the degree of myocarditis myocardial fibrosis."
26,Targeting Fas-associated protein with death domain gene with chitosan-lipid nanoparticles inhibits coronary heart disease progression in mice,2022-01-01,"Cell apoptosis or programmed cell death is a physiological phenomenon during the development of the body; however, under certain pathological conditions, insufficient, or excessive apoptosis can cause tissue damage and physiological dysfunction. This study investigated the inhibition of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced macrophage apoptosis in mice with coronary heart disease by regulating the target Fasassociated protein with death domain (FADD) gene. We used Western blotting to measure the effect of oxLDL on mouse macrophages and observe the effects of adding simvastatin, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), self-blocking, and other drugs. The results indicated that the target FADD gene played an important role in inhibiting lactate dehydrogenase release by 13%, in the process of oxLDL-induced lipid aggregation in macrophages. The EC50 observed by dual acridine orange/ethidium bromide fluorescence-staining accounts for the proportion of FADD being reduced by 32%, indicating that the target FADD gene exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on oxLDL-induced macrophage apoptosis in coronary heart disease. This study used a novel chitosan-lipid nanoparticle as a gene carrier to significantly improve efficacy. Therefore, targeting the FADD gene using novel chitosan-lipid nanoparticles to deliver siRNA could be a potential clinical treatment in coronary heart disease."
27,Usage of fingolimod combined with polyacetone system in the treatment of mouse kidney transplantation model,2022-01-01,"A kidney transplantation model was established with mouse subjects, which was treated with the fingolimod (FTY720) combined with polyacetone (PCL) membrane controlled release system to analyze its therapeutic effect on kidney transplantation. 45 C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice were randomly enrolled into 3 groups, 9 in the Sham group did not receive any treatment, 18 in the model group and FTY720-PCL group, with 9 donors and recipients, respectively. The mice in model group were treated with kidney transplantation, and those in the FTY720-PCL group were treated with FTY720-PCL based on the model group. The three groups of mice were analyzed for serum creatinine (Scr), urine output, survival time of transplanted kidney (SToTK), overall survival time (OST), and the spleen tissue of the recipient mice. RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of IL-2 and ICAM-1 mRNA, and Western blot was used to detect the expression of CTLA4Ig and Fas/FasL protein. The pathological changes of the transplanted kidney were graded and evaluated according to the BanffSchema pathological diagnostic criteria. The results showed that the Scr level of the recipient mice in the FTY720-PCL group was greatly reduced (P < 0.05). Compared with the model group, urine output, SToTK, and OST were greatly increased (P < 0.05). The levels of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) mRNA in the spleen (P < 0.05) of the mice in the FTY720-PCL group were obviously reduced, the level of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 immunoglobulin (CTLA4Ig) in the kidney was increased obviously, and factor related apoptosis (Fas) and factor related apoptosis ligand (FasL) (P < 0.05) levels dropped dramatically compared with the model group. The results of hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE staining) showed that the rejection rate of transplanted kidneys in the FTY720-PCL group was greatly reduced. In summary, FTY720-PCL membrane system can reduce the rejection rate of mouse kidney transplantation and prolong SToTK."
28,Effects of new bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-liposome nanoparticles on DNA methylation status of hepatitis B-related liver cancer,2022-01-01,"Primary liver cancer is the most common tumor in China, with high morbidity and mortality. Nanotechnology has made continuous progress in recent years. In this study, new liposome nanoparticles were used to assemble the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-liposome nano-drug delivery system, to explore molecular mechanism of this technology in anti-HBV-related liver cancer. In this study, human hepatitis Brelated liver cancer cells were exposed to the novel BMSC-liposome nano-drug delivery system, and specific methylation analysis PCR (MSP) was used to detect cell apoptosis. Flow cytometry analysis was used to test cell cycle. Proliferation of human hepatitis B-related liver cancer cell line HepG2 was analyzed by MTT, while DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)/hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) methylation status was detected by real time PCR. The new liposomal nanoparticle BMSC nano-drug delivery system increased the rate of cell apoptosis, inhibited the proliferation of HepG2, and blocked the cells in the G2/M phase. In addition, the new liposomal nanoparticle BMSC nano-drug delivery system reduced the content of hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) in the HepG2 cells, and regulated virus replication by controlling the expression of methyltransferase (DNMT). DNA methylation level is one of the criteria for evaluating virus replication. The results from this study suggest that low-level methylation can contribute to the occurrence and development of tumors, and regional CpG island hypermethylation can increase DNase, to effectively promote the development of viral related diseases. HBx can effectively promote the progress of liver cancer through the expression of DNMT. In this study, a novel BMSC-liposome drug delivery system effectively controlled the replication of hepatitis B virus and increased the apoptosis of liver cancer cells. This process is closely related to inhibition of DNA methylase and promotion of HBx methylation."
29,Environmentally friendly one-step coating of antibacterial urinary catheters with silver nanoparticle impregnated layer,2022-01-01,"Urinary tract infection is the most common infection acquired in hospitals and is usually associated with catheterization. A simple and robust antibacterial coating on rubber urethral catheter using a one-step process has been developed. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were coated on the surface and impregnated near the subsurface region through diffusion transport into the porous tube material. This coating technique does not require any complicated instruments, volatile organic compounds, toxic chemicals as reducing agents and polymer binders. AgNPs embedded on the subsurface of catheters provides prolonged antibacterial effects with a slow release of silver ions at 0.44 mg/L after 14 days. Coated catheters were tested for their antibacterial activity against representative pathogenic bacteria. Inhibition zones of approximately 11 mm were observed. AgNPs coated catheters inhibited the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus (99.99%) and Escherichia coli (99.9999%) after 4 h. This simple fabrication technique opens a new avenue for the development of an inexpensive and quick process for the fabrication of rubber surfaces with an eco-friendly and easy to scale-up strategy for preventing bacterial colonization."

In this work, a kind of novel platinum-tungsten carbide (Pt-WC)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) electrocatalyst with different WC loadingsis prepared by self-assembly technology for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). The electrochemical performance and stability of Pt-WC/MWCNTs electrocatalysts toward EOR are investigated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The mass activity of Pt-WC0.15/MWCNTs electrocatalyst for EOR is 581.94 mA mg-1 Pt, which is 1.33 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C (ETEK). The significant enhancement can be attributed to the more exposed active sites and the synergistic effect between Pt and WC. The Pt-WC x /MWCNTs are a kind of excellent and effective electrocatalyst for EOR, which has a broad application prospect in fuel cells."

The substrate consisted of AgNPs encapsulated in N-[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]diethylenetriamine (ATS) hydrogels, and the resulting ATS-Ag SERS substrate presented good viscoelasticity, allowing it to conform to the surface of various materials of arbitrary roughness. The SERS peak intensity concentration change was rapidly captured and analyzed using a self-developed smartphone-based app system, which implements quantitative detection of carbofuran. The results showed that carbofuran can be detected with high sensitivity, with a linear range of 0.01–1.0 ppm and a detection limit of 0.05 ppm. In combination with a website, the proposed approach features high sensitivity, high simplicity of implementation, and a high throughput, which provides a promising means for the in situ determination of targets in practical applications."
32,Impact of metal ions (Cr/Mn) loaded CaCO extracted from tap water for adsorption/ degradation of toxic pollutants under sunlight,2022-01-01,"The present work involves the extraction and characterization of highly efficient CaCO3 from tap water. The resulting white powder was sintered at 900 °C and study for the adsorption/degradation of Rhodamine-B (RB) dye. After sintering at a higher temperature, it was found that CaCO3 was decomposed into CaO and Ca(OH)2 which results in the superior adsorption of RB dye relative to CaCO3 dried at room temperature. The degradation efficiency of CaCO3 was further enhanced by loading two metal ions (Cr+6, Mn+7) having different oxidation states. The as-prepared composites were characterized by different techniques i.e., dynamic light scattering, X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and UV-Visible spectrophotometer and examined for photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine-B (RB) dye under sunlight. The average hydrodynamic size of bare CaCO3 (900 °C) found to be 0.63 µm which was increased to 1.34 µm and 1.48 µm after loading of Cr+6 and Mn+7 ions respectively. SEM images suggested the hierarchical morphology of CaCO3 and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)-mapping also confirms the presence of Cr+6 and Mn+7 ions on the surface CaCO3. It was observed that Mn+7-CaCO3 (900 °C) shows higher degradation efficiency of RB dye under solar radiation relative to bare and Cr+6 loaded CaCO3 and exhibited a higher rate constant of 4.6 × 10-2 min-1."
33,Electronic and optical properties of copper zinc tin sulphide (CuZnSnS) doped with calcium and barium,2022-01-01,"Harnessing solar energy with the help of cheaper, more abundant and environmentally-friendly materials is a major research thrust currently. Health hazards emanating from fossil fuel combustion, depletion of nonrenewable sources, global warming and environmental degradation are some of the push factors towards clean, non-toxic and environmentally friendly methods of producing electrical energy. To harvest solar energy, the Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) semiconductor is currently a foremost candidate, which can supply encouraging amounts of energy. Some of its advantages are the optical direct band gap and high absorption coefficients. In this study, CZTS is investigated as a material for solar cells using first principles method. Thus, structural, electronic and optical properties of pure CZTS and doped CZTS (1 1 2) surface were investigated using the DFT as implemented in the CASTEP code. Alkaline earth metals, calcium (Ca) and barium (Ba) were adsorbed on the CZTS (1 1 2) surface using the adsorption locator module. Our results suggest that doping with barium rather than calcium could improve the photocatalytic activity of the device."
34,Fracture toughness evaluation of 37CrNi3MoVE steel used for high-pressure air storage cylinder,2022-01-01,"The air storage cylinders, forming part of the impulse air system for submarine, are high-pressure steel cylinders dome-shaped at each end. To prevent the risk of cylinders rupture, the fracture toughness of cylinders is necessary to be tested. The three-point bending samples used in the fracture toughness experiment were taken from a cylinder made of 37CrNi3MoVE steel. With the consideration of the effect of the manufacturing process, both axial specimens and circumferential specimens were sampled, and the fracture toughness was compared. The effective data obtained from fracture toughness experiments were processed by different standards, such as ISO 12135 standard and ASTM E1820 standard. The fracture surface is analyzed from macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. From the test results of circumferential fracture toughness and axial fracture toughness, it can be clearly seen that under the influence of the processing technology, the circumferential fracture toughness of the cylinder of the high-pressure gas cylinder is smaller than the circumferential fracture toughness. Finally, comparing the fracture toughness values obtained by the ASTM E1820 standard with the fracture toughness values obtained by the ISO 12135 standard, it is found that the fracture toughness values obtained under the ASTM E1820 standard are all greater than the fracture toughness values obtained by the ISO 12135 standard."
35,Effect of Mg on high temperature softening resistance of Cu–Cr–Fe alloy,2022-01-01,"This paper focuses on researching the softening resistance performance of Mg alloy under high temperature and the evolution of microstructure during high-temperature treatment. The results showed that, compared with Cu-0.39Cr-0.12Fe alloy, Cu-0.38Cr-0.04Fe-0.08Mg alloy has higher resistance to softening temperature, hardness and conductivity, which were 40 °C, 13 HV, 5% IACS higher than that of Cu-0.39Cr-0.12Fe alloy. Both of the aging precipitated phase of two alloys are nano-Cr phase. Mg can inhibit the growing of nano-Cr phase and the grain recrystallization process significantly. According to 3DAP analysis, the interface structure of Cr/Mg/Cu is formed, which might be the key factor that results in the excellent softening resistance performance of Cu–Cr–Fe–Mg alloy."
36,Clinical application of nano-biomedical composite materials in treatment and nursing,2022-01-01,"Nano-biocomposite materials are widely used in the treatment and nursing of gynecological tumors. Nanobiocomposite materials can be loaded with anti-tumor drugs to achieve the targeted effect of gynecological tumor treatment. In this article, the nano-biomedical composite gold nanostar particles loaded with the anti-tumor drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) are incubated with ovarian cancer cells and treated simultaneously by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Studies have found that radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone has a weaker effect on the survival rate of ovarian cancer cells. Suppose an ovarian cancer cell complex loaded with nano-biomedical composite gold nanostar particles loaded with the anti-tumor drug DOX. In that case, the cell survival rate is significantly reduced after radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Nanobiomedical composite gold nanostar particles can play a synergistic role in the radiotherapy and chemotherapy of gynecological ovarian cancer tumors. They can improve the efficiency of ovarian cancer treatment clinically."
37,Stretchable interfaces with conformal contact,2022-01-01,"Without conformal contact, stretchable electronic devices are significantly degraded during device operation and post treatment, due to air trapping and the resulting formation of uneven surface. In this work, under the hard condition that a stretchable polyacrylate elastomer (VHB) layer with high porosity which can lead to more pore formation at the VHB interface is introduced in the stretchable device preparation, conformal contact is achieved by vacuum process (VP). Planar images indicate that, although the conventional process results in the formation of pore with a size of 0.1 mm at the vacuum pressure of 10-6 Torr, the VP prevents it until 10-6 Torr. Surface analysis using near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure indicates the VP leads to less corrugation in the surface of graphene electrode located near the VHB; thus, finally resulting in significantly higher performance of an organic light emitting diode having the VHB and the graphene."
38,Regeneration of aged transformer oil by adsorption using attapulgite-chitosan composite,2022-01-01,"The attapulgite-chitosan (AT-CS) composites were prepared from attapulgite (ATP) and chitosan (CS). The composites were characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Brunner Emmet Teller (BET).

The specific surface area of the AT-CS was higher than that of ATP, increased by 60.47%, which was 189.1272 m2/g. The physico-chemical properties of the regenerated oil after adsorption were found to approach the fresh oil. Moreover, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) was used to observe that the oxidation by-products in the aged oil were removed by the AT-CS composite, clearly demonstrating the potential of using AT-CS as an adsorbent for transformer oil regeneration."

And surgery is an effective way to perform flexor tendon injuries. Collagen biofilm can effectively prevent postoperative tendon adhesion. Because of this, we analyzed the effect of collagen biofilm in preventing postoperative adhesion of flexor tendon injury caused by basketball. This article discusses 80 patients who came to our hospital for treatment and were diagnosed with basketball flexor tendon injuries. We randomly divide them into two groups. In the observation group, 3-0 or 4-0 atraumatic suture modified Kessler’s method, or internal “8” suture was used to repair the flexor tendon with (1–2) × 4 cm biofilm or liquid coating around the suture of the tendon. The control group was treated by suturing the wound after hemostasis. Compare the efficacy of the two and other biological indicators. The study found statistical differences in the postoperative mobility and excellent and good rate of the two groups of patients. For this reason, we believe that collagen biofilm can be effective in the surgical treatment of flexor tendon injuries caused by basketball. This method is worthy of clinical application."

This makes it have a series of excellent macroscopic properties such as force, magnetism, electricity, optics, chemistry, and biology that traditional materials do not have. This article studies the application of new polymer nano-bio materials in orthopedic trauma. We study the effect of nanolevel hydroxyapatite gradient coating on the expression of osteoblast phenotypic factors. The shear strength of the implant-bone interface is better than the titanium alloy group and the titanium alloy group. So we can conclude that the nano-grade hydroxyapatite gradient coating material has good biological characteristics. It can promote the early healing of the bone trauma interface. This material is worthy of clinical application."
42,A review of progress on high nitrogen austenitic stainless-steel research,2021-12-01,"High nitrogen austenitic stainless steels are commonly used in wide range of applications because of their excellent properties, attracting super attention over the past decades. Compared with other metal materials, high nitrogen austenitic stainless steel increases the nitrogen content under the premise that the structure is austenite, giving it excellent mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. Based on relevant documents from the past ten years, this article summarizes and compares three preparation methods for high nitrogen austenitic stainless steels, namely: powder nitriding, melt nitriding and bulk nitriding. They can be divided into six categories according to other differences as explained by the latest research progress on strengthening and toughening mechanism for high nitrogen austenitic stainless steels: composite structure strengthening, fine grain strengthening, precipitation strengthening and strain strengthening.

It further describes the emerging nickel-free high nitrogen austenitic stainless steels and its biocompatibility. Welding applications of high nitrogen austenitic stainless steels are also described from three aspects: friction stir welding, arc welding and brass solder. Finally, this article puts forward the development direction of high nitrogen austenitic stainless steels in the future."
43,Observation on the effect of high-quality nursing intervention in gadolinium-based sodium material adjuvant radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer,2021-12-01,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a common malignant tumor. Because of the concealment of its early clinical symptoms, most of the patients are diagnosed at the middle and advanced stages. Nowadays, the NSCLC has become one of the critical factors affecting the quality of life of Chinese residents. Traditional radiotherapy cannot meet the clinical treatment needs of NSCLC patients. Here, we used gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3) as a new radiosensitizer matrix and introduced paclitaxel (PTX), with excellent anticancer cell migration function to construct paclitaxel-gadolinium oxide nanoparticles (PTX-Gd2O3 NPs). The clinical experiments show the unique nanometer radiation dose enhancement effect and radiosensitive function of PTX-Gd2O3 NPs. The new nanodrug can successfully exert the secretion of thrombin-sensitive protein-1 of PTX, thereby inhibiting the proliferation and migration of tumor cells, which is expected to provide a new direction for treating long-term NSCLC."
44,A new strategy based on polyethylene glycol coated gold nanoparticles to enhance the sensitivity of radiotherapy for glioma,2021-12-01,"Radiotherapy (RT), as an essential method for glioma treatment, can effectively kill tumor cells. However, radiation resistance of blood–brain barrier and glioma cells leads to poor efficacy of RT, which cannot effectively improve the survival time of patients. Therefore, designing methods to improve the sensitivity of glioma cells to radiation is the key to improve the effect of RT. We propose a novel strategy for radiosensitizing glioma cells based on gold nanoparticles coated with polyethylene glycol. Results of clone formation experiments demonstrated that the Au [email protected] radiosensitization ratio (SER) was as high as 1.74, which effectively improved the killing effect of X-rays on the tumor. We successfully established a glioma mouse model and applied Au [email protected] to RT. Results of in vivo experiments showed that Au [email protected] combined with X-rays can significantly reduce the expression of tumor-related molecules and effectively inhibit the process of tumor invasion, proliferation, and migration."

Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of miR-203a-3p in cell lines and clinical human CSCC samples. A luciferase reporter system was used to verify the targeted regulatory relationship of miR-203a-3p to APC, and a miR-203a-3p lentivirus overexpression vector was constructed and used to transfect CSCC SCL-1 cells. RT-PCR was used to detect changes in miR-203a-3p and APC gene expression and Western blot was used to detect differences in APC and β-catenin protein expression. MTT and clonogenic assays were used to evaluate cell growth and detect clone formation, respectively. MiR-203a-3p showed decreased expression in SCL-1 cells and CSCC samples. Results of luciferase reporter assay showed that the ratio of Renilla luciferase to Firefly luciferase was significantly decreased in SCL-1 cells of the APC 3′-UTR+miR-203a-3p (wild-type) group compared with those of the APC 3′-UTR+negative control group. After lentiviral infection of SCL-1 cells, the abundance of miR-203a-3p and phosphorylated β-catenin protein was significantly increased, whereas the abundance of APC and β-catenin protein was significantly reduced. Cell phenotyping analysis showed that miR-203a-3p decreased cell proliferation. MiR-203a-3p inhibits the proliferation of SCL-1 cells through targeted regulation of APC and may play a role as a tumor suppressor gene through the Wnt pathway. Nanotechnology has potential future research applications in gene vector transfection technology."
46,Lower limb biomechanical characteristics in patients with diabetic foot: Analysis and efficacy of modified orthopedic insoles,2021-12-01,"We studied biochemical characteristics of the lower limbs of patients with diabetic foot (DF) to develop custom orthopedic insoles. In this study of 88 patients with diabetes, 58 had a normal foot appearance, 18 had plantar calluses, and 12 had valgus feet. The maximum pressure applied to the left and right plantar of patients with DF is under the third metatarsal, and the peak areas of the left and right feet are below the first metatarsal. Pain and American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society scores were reduced after one year of wearing modified orthopedic insoles versus unmodified insoles. After one year of wearing the insole, the pressure was reduced in the left and right feet of both groups, but the intervention group showed a more significant reduction than the controls. The swing time was shorter in the intervention group and the incidence of DF ulcers was 6.81% higher in the control group. Thus, lower limb biomechanics differ in patients with DF, most of who experience calluses and hallux valgus. Modified orthopedic insoles provide improved sole pain, ankle-foot joint function, and distribution of plantar pressure, and incidence of DF ulcers."

Surface chemistry of the C-dots was studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The stability measurement of C-dots was done via Zeta potential. The biocompatibility of the C-dots was evaluated using a breast cancer cell line (MCF-7). C-dots were used as potential bioimaging agents for fluorescence imaging of mammalian cell lines. Concentration-dependent cellular uptake of the C-dots by the MCF-7 cells was shown qualitatively using fluorescence microscopy. The study also assessed the antioxidant activity of the C-dots. Thus, this work validates the red onion peel-derived C-dots as excellent bioimaging and antioxidant agents for mammalian cell lines."
48,Cerium-oxide-loaded poly(-caprolactone) hydrogel wound dressing for cutaneous wound healing and antimicrobial treatment in burn wound infection: Development and detailed biological evaluation,2021-12-01,"Wound dressing materials are essential in wound healing care management. In addition to their supportive effect on the care management, polysaccharides and metal oxide nanoparticles actively contribute to the healing process. CeO2 nanoparticles can promote wound healing through oxidative damage in the wound environment against elevated levels of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, it is necessary to develop multi-functional hydrogel wound dressing materials to stimulate wound healing. In this study, a CeO2-loaded poly(ɛ-caprolactone)/PEC polymeric hydrogel was fabricated as a cutaneous wound-healing material. The in-vitro cytotoxic and wound healing activities were analyzed using the fabricated material in mice. A histological examination showed that the nanofibrous material accelerated the reepithelialization and provided an excellent collagen deposition. In addition, the prepared hydrogels were tested against S. aureus and E. coli. Our results evidence the unique characteristics of the hydrogel wound dressing material exhibiting antibacterial and antioxidant activities and good biocompatibility and healing efficiencies by enhancing the reepithelialization and granulation formation and effectively accelerating the wound healing to prevent skin infections."
49,Characterization of micro hole on super alloy GH4037 and stainless steel 304 by millisecond-pulsed Nd:YAG laser processing,2021-12-01,"In this study, both super alloy GH4037 and stainless steel 304 were selected as experimental materials to be processed by LASERTEC 80 PowerDrill three-dimensional solid laser machining center. The structure of the micro hole was researched by 3D Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Meanwhile, The holes taper, entrance and exit ends diameter, microcrack, recast layer, orifice deposits and the heat affected zone (HAZ) were also investigated. The single factor experimental method was used to research the influences of defocusing amount, pulse energy, repetition frequency, and pulse duration on quality of micro holes. Experimental results indicated that the holes entrance and exit ends diameter enlarged with increased pulse energy from 3.4 J to 4.2 J. The entrance and exit ends diameter of holes decreased with increased pulse duration from 0.5 ms to 2.5 ms. Besides, the variation of holes diameter and taper were more obvious with repetition frequency changing from 10 Hz to 30 Hz, and variation range for the entrance and exit ends diameters and taper were not obvious with increased defocusing amount from −2 mm to 2 mm. The herein results indicated that pulse energy was one of the most significant influencing elements, and higher pulse energy could bring about lower hole taper within a certain range. Meanwhile, shorter pulse duration reduced splash and debris of holes surface. The recast layer, micro crack and HAZ were existed in the both kinds of experimental materials. Moreover, the microcrack and recast layer on holes wall of GH4037 were less than those of 304, and the HAZ in drilling hole for GH4037 was more than that of 304. The experimental results for the holes size were compared with corresponding simulation results under different defocusing amount respectively, which verified the accuracy of simulation results. Combining the above factors, the quality of micro holes drilling on super alloy GH4037 was better than stainless steel 304."
50,Experimental process and kinetic behavior of carbothermal reduction of lithium cobaltate as a cathode for waste lithium batteries,2021-12-01,"Lithium cobaltate as a cathode material has great recycling value in the recycling process of spent lithium-ion batteries, To promote the thermal reduction process of lithium cobaltate and recover high-value cobalt and lithium metals, we studied the process of lithium cobaltate reduction by carbon under different conditions and its thermal reaction kinetics. The effects of calcination temperature, raw material ratio, pelletizing pressure and holding time on the reduction rate of lithium cobaltate were investigated by controlling variables. The results showed that the optimum experimental conditions were as follows: mass ratio of carbon and lithium cobaltate was 1:1, pelletizing pressure was 45 MPa, calcination temperature was 800 °C, and calcination time was 6 h. Under these conditions, lithium cobaltate could be converted into cobalt and lithium carbonate, and the recovery rate of cobalt and lithium was 97% and 95%, respectively. A kinetic study on the carbothermal reduction reaction of LiCoO2 showed that the average activation energy of the carbothermal reaction of LiCoO2 under nitrogen protection was 280.6851 kJ/mol, and the mechanism model of the thermal decomposition reaction of LiCoO2 was controlled by chemicals, showing a deceleration curve. The corresponding process conforms to the threedimensional diffusion mechanism of the inverse Jander equation, which lays a theoretical foundation for the high-efficiency separation and recovery of LiCoO2 cathode material for waste lithium-ion batteries."
51,Preparation of ZrO in SiC coating via hydrothermal method and sintering process onto carbon/carbon composite,2021-12-01,"To reduce the defects in SiC coating, a SiC/ZrO2 composite is prepared and coated onto carbon/carbon composite via hydrothermal method and sintering process. The microstructure, surface morphology, chemical states, and elemental distribution of SiC/ZrO2 coating are analysed with X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In addition, we analyze the tribological behavior of the SiC and SiC/SiC/ZrO2 coatings and the related microstructure. The results show that SiC/ZrO2 coating is composed of SiC phase, ZrO2 phase, carbon phase, and SiO2 phase. EDS results show that Si, C, O, and Zr elements are present in the SiC/ZrO2 coating. Moreover, XPS results show the presence of SiC, ZrO2, and SiO2. According to the SEM image, the coating is dense except for some observable cracks. Notably, specimens with the SiC/ZrO2 coating have smaller, more stable friction coefficients and less weight loss than specimens with the SiC-only coating. The formation of ZrO2 strengthens the SiC coating, while the SiO2 formed in the coating acts as a lubricant and reduces the friction coefficient of the coating."
52,Study on corrosion resistance of superhydrophobic surface on aluminum alloy,2021-12-01,"Anti-corrosion of aluminum alloys with different roughness were researched in this study. To further verify the relationship between anti-corrosion and surface roughness, surface with micro structure alloy was successfully fabricated via anode oxidation on aluminum. The water contact angle of aluminum alloy surface after coating polypropylene film was 154° and sliding angle was 3°. The micro-nano structure was constructed by adding nano-SiO2. The contacts angle of surface was 165° and the sliding angle was 1.8°. The superhydrophobic samples were used to test corrosion resistance. Compared with aluminum coated with unmodified film, the corrosion potential for modified superhydrophobic aluminum alloy increased by about 0.05 V. When nano-SiO2 particles were added, the corrosion resistance for the sample was also improved."
53,Controlling size and distribution of Ag nanoparticles in near surface of SiO glass by low-energy ion implantation,2021-12-01,"Ag nanoparticles were embedded in the near surface of SiO2 substrate and fabricated by low-energy ion implantation method in this study. The optical and structural properties of Ag implanted samples were investigated using optical spectroscopy, transmission electron microscope (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The grain size and distribution of nanoparticles embedded in the substrate were characterized by TEM and AFM characterization. Results showed that the grain size and depth of distribution of nanoparticles were controlled by changing the ion implantation energy and dose. Furthermore, the Ag nanoparticles embedded near surface of substrate prepared by this low-energy ion implantation method had strong local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) characteristics. Our work demonstrates a practical means for fabrication of metal nanoparticles with controllable size and distribution using ion implantation technology, which is helpful to the application of local plasmon resonance effect of metal nanoparticles."
54,Preparation of diamond/aluminum composite with titanium coating on diamond powder by microwave technology,2021-12-01,"In this research, the diamond particles were coated with titanium by microwave heating method, then the Ti-coated diamond particles were used as raw material to fabricate the diamond/Al composites by microwave sintering. The result shows that the diamond particles could be covered with a uniform and continuous Ti coating under microwave irradiation, and the best Ti coating was obtained at 810 °C for 1 h. The metallic bond between diamond and Ti was formed to generate the intermediate transition layer of TiC. The diamond/Al composites which used Ti-coated diamond particles as raw material and were fabricated by microwave sintering show high relative density and hardness. The relative density and hardness of the diamond/Al composites increased with the temperature. While the composites were sintered at 710 °C for 1 h, the density could reach 2.855 g·cm−3, and relative density was 92.09%, which shows better microstructures and properties. There is Al3Ti alloy phase in Ti-coated diamond/Al composites, so the Ti-coated diamond can be well combined with the Al matrix, which can further improve the properties of the composites."
55,Virtual reality application with nano-display improves training of pipeline installation in oil and gas industry,2021-12-01,"Nanotechnology has the potential to have a huge effect on all industries, including the oil and gas industry. Virtual Reality (VR) also has large and comprehensive perspective in the interest of oil and gas industry. VR approach becomes essential at different phases in oil and gas industry. This study aims to identify the causes of Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) defect in oil and gas industry. This work also develops VR training platform with nano-display devices. The training platform is to be used in the oil and gas industry for heat pipe removal and pipeline construction. Implementation of VR training platform offers huge advantage to the industry as it does not interrupt the operation and does not require investment in the training facilities. Case study was used to determine the causes of TEG defects. Continuous exposure to heat, over production and prolonged run are the three factors that were found to be the defect of Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) in oil and gas industry. Unity 3D, HTC™ Vive device, Autodesk Maya software and C# Programming were used to develop the VR platform. Finally, the 3D models of TEGs were designed and modelled for heat pipe removal and pipeline installation in oil and gas industry. As we understand that nanotechnology plays an integral role in hardware and communications for virtual reality technology, one might propose nano-display which provides the best resolution and pixels smaller than a micrometer."
56,Influence of in volatilization on photoluminescence in InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells,2021-12-01,"Two multiple quantum well (MQW) InGaN/GaN structures emitting green light, without (A) and with (B) an indium (In) volatilization suppression technique (IVST) during growth of the active region, were fabricated. The dependencies of the photoluminescence (PL) spectra upon temperature at different levels of excitation power were investigated. The results indicate that an IVST can increase the In content while suppressing the phase separation caused by volatilization of that In incorporated in the well layers. Also, compared with Structure B with IVST, which contains one phase structure, Structure A without IVST, which contains two separate phases (i.e., an In-rich phase and an In-poor phase), exhibits higher internal quantum efficiency (IQE) at low excitation power and lower IQE at high excitation power. The former is mainly attributed to the stronger In-rich phase-related localization effect of Structure A, because the In-rich phase-related emission dominates the PL spectra of Structure A at a low excitation power; the latter is mainly due to the In-poor phase-related weaker localization effect of Structure A, because the In-poor phase-related emission dominates the PL spectra of Structure A at high excitation power because localized states in this In-rich phase are saturated."
57,Preparation of electrochemically deposited nickel—cobalt nanocomposite coating and research on its corrosion resistance,2021-12-01,"Alloying as a way of improving material properties has really gained a lot of global attention over the past few years. Alloying majorly improves physicochemical, electrochemical, thermal, and mechanical and corrosion resistance of a parent material. In this work, electrodeposition using a sulphamate electrolytic cell under varied concentrations of the secondary phase of cobalt.

58,Study on the effect of fengycin on the respiration and metabolic mechanism of ,2021-12-01,"This study investigate the inhibiting effect of fengycin on respiration and nutrient utilization of Penicillium expansum. The respiratory inhibition rate of the P. expansum was determined by the test of dissolved oxygen fengycin, The effect of fengycin treatment on the activity of P. expansum mitochondrial complex enzyme was detected by mitochondrial enzyme activity assay. The ability of fengycin treatment to P. expansum the utilization of total sugar and total protein was determined by DNS colorimetric method and biuret method. After fengycin treatments, the TCA pathway of respiratory metabolism in P. expansum was inhibited. Besides, fengycin could block the gene expression in P. expansum by binding P. expansum mitochondrial complex enzyme II and III related genes. Therefore, the activity of mitochondrial enzymes was affected. With the increasement of fengycin concentration, the absorption and utilization capacity of P. expansum to total sugar and total protein decreased significantly. Fengycin could inhibit the respiratory metabolism and reduce the biochemical metabolism level in P. expansum and finally caused the growth inhibition."
59,Design and formulation of microbially induced self-healing concrete for building structure strength enhancement,2021-11-01,"Self-healing concrete is described as the capability of material to repair their cracks independently. Cracks in concrete are well-known circumstance because of their short tensile strength. Many researchers carried out their research on self-healing concrete using different classification and clustering methods. But the temperature variation and pH variation were not minimized. In order to address these problems, a Multivariate Logistic Regressed Chi-Square Deep Recurrent Neural Network based Self-Healing (MLRCSDRNN-SH) Method is introduced. The main aim of MLRCSDRNN-SH method is to improve building structures strength through inducing the micro-bacteria in concrete. Multiple Logistic Regressed Chi-Square Deep Recurrent Neural Network (MLRCSDRNN) is used to revise bacteria’s stress-strain behaviour towards enhanced material strength in the MLRCSDRNN-SH approach. Initially, the bacteria selection is carried out in alkaline environment like Bacillus subtilis, E. coli and Pseudomonas sps. The data sample is given to the input layer. The input layer transmits sample to the hidden layer 1. The regression analysis is carried out between the multiple independent variables (i.e., parameters) using multivariate logistic function for improving the building structure strength. The regressed value is transmitted to the hidden layer 2. The pearson chi-squared independence hypothesis is performed to identify the probability of crack self-healing property for increasing the building structure strength. When probability value is higher, then the building structure strength is high. Otherwise, the output of second hidden layer is feedback to the input of hidden layer 1. The mixture with higher strength of building structure is sent to the output layer. Several specimens have different sizes used by various researchers for bacterial material study in comparison with the concrete. Depending on experimental results, compressive strength restoration proved higher self-healing ability of the concrete."
60,Regulation of melanoma cell growth by a miR-21 loaded targeted delivery system based on microparticles and nanoparticles targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN),2021-11-01,"The modulatory effect of miR-21 on the proliferation of melanoma cells through stimulation of PTEN (Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) expression was investigated in the current study. PTEN, as a tumor suppressor, is expressed in low levels in melanoma tissues and cell lines. Nevertheless, miR-21 can stimulate cancer development and suppress cell apoptosis. Overexpression of PTEN substantially impaired the proliferation of miR-21-treated melanoma cells. In addition, miR-21 and PTEN were observed to exhibit a combinatorial effect, whereas miR-21 could negatively regulate the expression of PTEN. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that miR-21 affects melanoma development by targeting PTEN, establishing a new strategy for treating malignant melanoma. Furthermore, in this study, microparticles and nanoparticles were employed as carriers to construct, through the self-assembly method, nanocapsules carrying miR-21 in order to develop an efficient nanocapsule delivery system of miR-21 against melanoma cells."

62,Synthesis and fluorescence of novel complexes of tricyano-dihydrofuran and ofloxacin,2021-11-01,"Quinolones are widely used, but there are few reports on the application of fluorescent probe analysis. In this paper, we synthesized a tricyano-dihydrofuran (DCDHF-2-V) electron acceptor, and a (DCDHF-2-V)-quinolone fluorescent nanoprobe was designed. Its structure was characterized by infrared spectroscopy (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultraviolet (UV). A novel tricyano-dihydrofuran-ofloxacin fluorescent nanoprobe was established for the first time by fluorescence spectrophotometry. A novel fluorescent nanoprobe was obtained and used in the determination of ofloxacin in vitro. The results showed that tricyano-dihydrofuran can form stable charge transfer complex with ofloxacin, and it can be used for the determination of ofloxacin in drugs as a fluorescent probe. While important experimental steps are for the first time achieved in this study for future Quinolone fluorescent nanoprobe implementations, this method is simple and sensitive."
63,"The clinical value of EEG monitoring and silver nanoparticles to detect the levels of serum Nesfatin-1, S100 and neuron-specific enolase in evaluating the severity and prognosis of epilepsy",2021-11-01,"This study aimed to explore the clinical value of electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring and the use of silver nanoparticles to detect serum levels of Nesfatin-1, S100β and Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in assessing the severity and prognosis of epilepsy. A total of 54 epilepsy patients treated at our hospital from June 2017 to June 2019 were selected as the epilepsy group, and 54 healthy subjects were selected as the control group. EEG and serum levels of Nesfatin-1, S100β, and NSE in epilepsy patients without seizure and within 1 hour of seizure were ascertained and compared. The Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale (LSSS) score was used to evaluate the severity of epilepsy in patients, and the correlation between EEG findings and serum Nesfatin-1, S100β , and NSE levels was analyzed. ROC analysis was also conducted on the levels of the three factors. The patients were followed up for 1 year, the mortality rate was calculated, and the levels of Nesfatin-1, S100β, and NSE in deceased and non-deceased patients were compared. There were 50 cases (92.6%) with EEG abnormalities in the epilepsy group and 31 cases (57.4%) with epileptic EEGs in the epileptic non-seizure group. There was a significant difference in the proportion of abnormal EEGs between the two groups of epilepsy patients (P <0.05); the biomarker (Nesfatin-1, S100β, and NSE) serum levels were higher in both the non-seizure group and epileptic group than the control group, and the levels in the seizure group were higher than those in the non-seizure group (P < 0.05); seizures in patients with epilepsy were positively correlated with EEG abnormalities and biomarker serum levels. There was, however, no significant correlation between EEG abnormalities and biomarker serum levels. ROC analysis of epilepsy patients and their serum levels of Nesfatin-1, S100β and NSE showed that the area under the curve corresponding to each index was 0.850, 0.881, and 0.868, respectively (P < 0.05). With regards to deceased patients, the proportion with an abnormal EEG was 100% (15/15), which was higher than 41.0% (16/39) of non-deceased patients. Serum levels of biomarkers were also significantly higher than those in non-deceased patients (P < 0.05). Changes in EEG and biomarker serum levels were closely related to the severity of epilepsy. The proportion of patients with abnormal EEGs during seizure periods was higher, and the expression of serum Nesfatin-1, S100β and NSE was also increased, which means they can be used as markers of epilepsy and have an impact on its prognosis"
64, reduces melanoma cell proliferation and increases apoptosis by inhibiting tyrosinase,2021-11-01,"Recently, research on using plant-derived drugs as anticancer agents has been greatly developed. Terminalia chebula (T. chebula) Retz., the mature fruit of T. chebula, contains active ingredients that have antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antitumor effects. Because traditional Chinese medicine components have unstable physical and chemical properties, such as poor solubility, fast decomposition, and high irritation, drug nanocarriers that effectively increase their solubility and reduce irritation are desirable. Additionally, T. chebula fruit can inhibit tyrosinase activity. This study aimed to determine whether T. chebula nanostructured lipid carriers can regulate the proliferation and apoptosis of melanoma cells by inhibiting tyrosinase activity. Tyrosinase activity in drug-treated melanoma cells was detected by MTT and DOPA oxidation assays, and cell proliferation rate was observed. Western blot (MTT) was used to detect the activity of apoptotic factors, and flow cytometry was used to determine the apoptotic rate. The results showed that tyrosinase activity and cell proliferation rate decreased with increasing drug concentration in cultured cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect was concentration-dependent. Additionally, cells cultured with a high concentration of T. chebula nanostructured lipid carriers could activate apoptotic factors and increase cell apoptosis. Thus, this study showed that T. chebula fruit nanostructured lipid carriers could inhibit the proliferation of melanoma cells and increase apoptosis by inhibiting tyrosinase activity, demonstrating a new plant-derived drug for melanoma treatment."
65,Design of chitosan-poloxamer nanogel and evaluation of its therapeutic effect on skin burn,2021-11-01,"Wound infection is the main cause of slow healing and complications of skin burns. Wound dressings can temporarily replace the skin to isolate the contamination and can be anti-infective, which is conducive to wound healing. In this study, a chitosan-Poloxamer-apigenin nanogel dressing (CTS-Plo-Api) was constructed using CTS and Plo, as carriers, and Api. In comparison with traditional treatments, the speed of wound healing is improved with the use of CTS-Plo-Api; moreover, it enhances bacteriostatic and anti-infection ability and has certain analgesic effects. Therefore, we demonstrate that CTS-Plo-Api is an exciting new clinical avenue for the treatment of burn patients."
66,A novel design of wound bandage using heparin-polyvinylpyrrolidone/TiO nanocomposite to improved antibacterial treatment and burn wound healing effect:  and  evaluation,2021-11-01,"In our current study, porous heparin-polyvinylpyrrolidone/TiO2 nanocomposite (HpPVP/TiO2) bandage were prepared via the incorporation of TiO2 into HpPVP hydrogels for biomedical applications such as burn infection. The effect of the HpPVP hydrogels and the nanoparticles of TiO2 composition on the functional group and the surface properties of the as-fabricated bandages were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The presence of TiO2 nanoparticles created the internal structure of the HpPVP hydrogel that aids in a homogeneous porous structure, as indicated by the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The size distribution of the TiO2 nanoparticles was measured using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The studies on the mechanical properties of the HpPVP hydrogel indicate that the addition of TiO2 nanoparticles increases its strength. The prepared HpPVP/TiO2 nanocomposite dressing has excellent antimicrobial activity were tested against bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) and has good biocompatibility against human dermal fibroblast cells (HFFF2) for biological applications. In addition, in vivo evaluations in Kunming mice exposed that the as-fabricated HpPVP/TiO2 nanocomposite bandages increased the wound curing and facilitated accelerate skin cell construction along with collagen development. The synergistic effects of the HpPVP/TiO2 nanocomposite hydrogel dressing material, such as its excellent hydrophilic nature, good bactericidal activity, biocompatibility and wound closure rate through in vivo test makes it a suitable candidate for burn infections."
67,Ropivacaine magnetic nanoparticles: An efficient local anesthetic nerve conduction blocker,2021-11-01,"Ropivacaine (Rop) is one of the commonly used local nerve blocks in clinical anesthesia and postoperative analgesia and it inhibits the stimulation of peripheral nociceptive pain. However, Rop alone is not effective enough to exert a controllable anesthetic effect in patients with peripheral nociceptive pain. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve the targeting of the local anesthetic effect of Rop and reduce its potential chronic or acute toxicity. In this study, a novel Rop nanocomposite hydrogel drug, N-isopropylacrylamide-methacrylic acid/ropivacaine magnetic nanoparticles (NIP-MAA/Rop MNPs), was constructed on magnetic iron oxide. The unique pH and temperature response of NIP-MAA can effectively retain magnetic properties, improve the stability and targeting controllability of magnetic nanoparticles, and avoid excessive drug diffusion. Therefore, the NIP-MAA/Rop MNPs is expected to open a new field of vision for the research of clinical anesthesia and postoperative analgesia."
68,Construction of lidocaine transmembrane nano-liposomes and preliminary study on its surface anesthetic effect,2021-11-01,"Lidocaine (Lido) is an amide local anesthetic that has both excitatory and inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and is one of a group of commonly used local nerve block drugs that are used in the clinic. However, traditional Lido does not meet the transdermal performance requirements of surface anesthetic agents for treating pain in patients. Optimizing the preparation of a Lido transdermal preparation and improving the control of anesthetic depth and efficiency has become a challenge in the field of topical anesthesia. In this study, a new type of Lido nano-transdermal preparation, carboxymethyl chitosan-modified lidocaine liposomes (Lido-CMCSNLP), were constructed based on nano-liposomes. Carboxymethyl chitosan can enhance the permeability of hydrophilic macromolecular pathways by interacting with negatively charged membrane glycoproteins, which is beneficial for the transdermal absorption of Lido. Therefore, Lido-CMCS-NLP provides a new approach for research in clinical topical anesthesia and perioperative topical analgesics."
69,A preliminary study on the application of paramagnetic composite nanoparticles in the navigation of hepatectomy,2021-11-01,"As the preferred treatment strategy for primary liver cancer, hepatic resection surgery can effectively improve the survival of liver cancer patients without relying on other treatments. However, traditional hepatic resection surgery cannot achieve precise localization of the cancer foci boundary. Therefore, improving hepatectomy targeting and reducing the metabolic rate of contrast agents in vivo has become an urgent challenge. This study constructed a novel indocyanine green nanocomposite fluorescent contrast agent, known as indocyanine green-carboxymethyl chitosan/superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (ICG-CMCS/SIO NP), based on a superparamagnetic iron oxide. The carboxymethyl chitosan and indocyanine green (ICG)’s graft copolymer served as a nanomaterial shell. This shell enhanced ICG targeting’s control ability and stability while effectively retaining its core magnetic properties. Thus, ICG-CMCS/SIO NPs should provide a novel idea for the study of clinical hepatocellular carcinoma resection surgery navigation."
70,Nanograin size effects on deformation mechanisms and mechanical properties of nickel: A molecular dynamics study,2021-11-01,"The grain size refinement of metallic materials to the nanometer scale produces interesting properties compared to the coarse-grained counterparts. Their mechanical behavior, however, cannot be explained by the classical deformation mechanisms. Using molecular dynamics simulations, the present work examines the influence of grain size on the deformation mechanisms and mechanical properties of nanocrystalline nickel. Samples with grain sizes from 3.2 to 24.1 nm were created using the Voronoi tessellation method and simulated in tensile and relaxation tests. The yield and ultimate tensile stresses follow an inverse Hall-Petch relationship for grain sizes below ca. 20 nm. For samples within the conventional Hall-Petch regime, no perfect dislocations were observed. Nonetheless, a few extended dislocations were nucleated from triple junctions, suggesting that the suppression of conventional slip mechanism is not uniquely responsible for the inverse Hall-Petch behavior. For samples respecting the inverse Hall-Petch regime, the high number of triple junctions and grain boundaries allowed grain rotation, grain boundary sliding, and diffusion-like behavior that act as competitive deformation mechanisms. For all samples, the atomic configuration analysis showed that Shockley partial dislocations are nucleated at grain boundaries, crossing the grain before being absorbed in opposite grain boundaries, leaving behind stacking faults. Interestingly, the stress relaxation tests showed that the strain rate sensitivity decreases with grain size for a specific grain size range, whereas for grains below approximately 10 nm, the strain rate sensitivity increases as observed experimentally. Repeated stress relaxation tests were also performed to obtain the effective activation volume parameter. However, the expected linear trend in pertinent plots required to obtain this parameter was not found."
71,Cartap wastewater treatment by a microwave-induced catalytic oxidation procedure over Ce/Co/-AlO,2021-11-01,"Microwave-assisted catalytic technology is potentially promising in the application of water treatment due to its merits of high reaction rates, simple equipment and operations. In case of the cartap wastewater rarely studied, the easy transformation of cartap into metabolites could induce higher toxicity. This study aimed to develop a novel catalyst Ce/Co/γ-Al2O3 to dispose cartap effectively. The catalyst was prepared by loading Ce and Co on the surface of the support Al2O3, followed by characterization with X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopies. Based on the treatment results, the microwave-induced catalytic oxidation procedure over Ce/Co/γ-Al2O3 could decompose the contaminants efficiently and fast in the case of a low oxidant dosage and a wide pH range. Under the conditions of pH of 5, microwave power of 450 W, catalyst dosage of 0.7 g and hydrogen peroxide dosage of 0.2 mL, the activity of Ce/Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst could reach up to 86.08%. Importantly, the Ce/Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst displayed excellent stability after using for 6 times in the degradation process. This work paved a new way for the effective catalyst design for efficient microwave-induced oxidative degradation."
72,Sediment wear prediction model of ZG06Cr13Ni4Mo turbine guide vane in sediment-laden hydropower station,2021-11-01,"The guide vane of a hydraulic turbine in any sediment-laden hydropower station is one of the components most seriously affected by sediment abrasion. Damage to a guide vane can significantly impact stable operation and energy characteristics of the unit, and it is thus essential to address and effectively manage this problem. In this study, the k-ε solid–liquid two-phase turbulence model and sample algorithm were used to numerically simulate the sand-water flow through the entire passage of a hydraulic turbine and sand samples were subsequently collected from the hydropower station to examine the sediment abrasion damage to turbine’s guide vane, which was made of ZG06Cr13Ni4Mo. Thereafter, calculation and test results were used to establish a prediction model for sediment abrasion of hydraulic turbine guide vane. These research findings could provide guidance for improved hydraulic turbine design and could thus contribute to the optimized operation of sediment-laden hydropower stations."
73,Mechanism of long-chain non-coding RNA hypoxia-inducible factor 1-antisense RNA 1 regulating chemotherapy resistance of retinoblastoma by inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor- expression,2021-11-01,"Retinoblastoma (Rb) mostly occurs in infants and young children with weak resistance. Surgical treatment causes great damage to children’s appearance, so adjuvant chemotherapy is needed to reduce the damage. But chemotherapeutic resistance affects treatment effectiveness and may even lead to the death of the child. Exploring the specific mechanism of drug resistance in Rb children is helpful to improve the therapeutic effect. It was found that the relative expression in Rb cell Y79, SO-Rb50, and HXO-Rb44 was greatly higher than that in normal hum an retinal cells. After transfection of SI-HIF1A-AS1 into Rb cells, the expression of lncRNA HIF1A-AS1 was decreased greatly, and the level of HIF-1α was down-regulated. Suppress lncRNA HIF1A-AS1 expression can reduce cell proliferation and improve apoptosis. Based on the overexpression of HIF-1α, the cell proliferation ability was restored partially, and the apoptosis ability was reduced greatly. When cells were cultured with vincristine, we found that suppress lncRNA HIF1A-AS1 expression can decrease cell survival, and overexpression of HIF-1α improved cell survival. The above results confirmed that inhibition of lncRNA HIF1AAS1 expression could reduce drug resistance of Y97 cells, while overexpression of HIF-1α can antagonize the drug resistance of low expression lncRNA HIF1A-AS1 against Rb cells. Therefore, this study suggests that lncRNA HIF1A-AS1 may regulate Rb cells’ resistance to vincristine by regulating HIF-1α expression."
74,Oxide scale behavior of Al–7.5 mass%Mg alloy containing trace Ca during short-term oxidation,2021-11-01,"In this study, using transmission electron microscopy and phase diagrams from thermodynamic calculations, we investigated the oxide film formation of Al–7.5 mass%Mg alloy containing Ca traces during short-term oxidation in terms of the thermodynamic stability and multi-element oxides by inter-diffusion based on the results of analysis for the oxide film. For the oxidation test at 515 ˚C, for 1 h, its results showed that there is no significant difference between the Ca-added and Ca-free Al–7.5 mass%Mg alloys was observed, while further exposure caused the Ca-free alloy to gain significant weight. Based on the standard Gibbs free energy for oxide production calculated in this study, CaO was the most preferential product among the single metal oxides examined. As per calculations for MgAl2O4-spinel formation reactions, the spinel formation from MgO was thermodynamically the most favorable. According to the phase diagrams calculated in this study, various multi-element oxides including Ca could possibly form in the oxide layer of Ca-added alloy. The analysis results of transmission electron microscopy confirmed that MgO is the primary oxide in the Al–Mg binary alloys. In oxidation tests conducted for less than 1 h, the spinel was rarely found. The outmost areas of oxide layers correspond to MgO and CaO in Ca-free and Ca-added alloys, respectively. However, in the Ca-added alloy, the inner layer contains certain amounts of Ca, Al, and Mg."
75,Development and field application of downhole crosslinking plugging agent,2021-11-01,"There were mainly cement slurry, bridge plugging and polymer gel plugging materials for fracture loss circulation and fractured/caved loss circulation. The downhole crosslinking plugging agent was researched for the plugging agents’ respective limitations leaded to low success rate of plugging and longer construction period. This kind of plug agent is consistent with emulsion, phase inversion agent and crosslinking agent. It could form a high strength elastomer when the plug agent is pumped into the leaking layer and mixed with a certain amount of water. The elastomer with strong ability could offer good resident ability to reduce cement slurry thickening by underground water and plugging mud, and increased the ratio of success. The experimental results showed that crosslinking time wasn’t affected by temperature, salt water, drilling cuttings, bentonite mud and other pollutants. The plug agent has been successfully used in several wells of the sixth block in Sudan."
76,Maxillary sinus pneumatization and augmentation: A three-dimensional finite element analysis,2021-11-01,"This study aimed to explore the biomechanical behaviors of maxillary sinus elevation with bone grafts of various heights and widths using three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis. We constructed 27 3D finite element models according to bone graft dimensions for three maxillary sinuses. These models were classified as (i) tapered, (ii) ovoid, and (iii) square. Each maxillary sinus type was analyzed with bone graft heights of 3 mm, 6 mm, and 9 mm and mesiodistal bone graft widths of 8 mm, 10 mm, and 12 mm. Different sinus pressure of 100 Pa, 500 Pa, and 1,000 Pa was applied to each aspect of the maxillary sinus. The maximum von Mises (max-VM) stress for each bone graft model was highest in the square group. The bone graft’s max-VM stress was decreased while increasing bone graft height from 3 to 9 mm in the tapered and square groups. In the ovoid group, the max-VM stress of all bone graft models decreased when the bone graft height increased from 3 to 6 mm. Thus 6 mm is the most appropriate bone graft height for all types of maxillary sinus elevation."
77,Cetuximab-modified doxorubicin bovine serum albumin nanoparticles for the treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor-overexpressing colon cancer cells,2021-10-01,"In this study, we developed an active targeting nano-immunoplatform of doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded bovine serum albumin (BSA) modified with the humanized antibody cetuximab, which can target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) of EGFR-overexpressing colon cancer, and subjected it to a series of in vitro evaluation. The obtained cetuximab-modified nanoparticles (cetuximab-DOX-immuno-NPs) had an average particle size of 218.2±2.2 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.162±0.023, a zeta potential of −23.28±0.75 mV, and a cetuximabloading efficiency of 33.6%±3.5%. The results of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity experiments showed that the cytotoxic of cetuximab-DOX-immuno-NPs in EGFR-overexpressing RKO colon cancer cells was significantly higher than it was in EGFR-under-expressing LS174 T cells. The results of flow cytometry showed that when DOX-immuno-NPs were used, DOX was eliminated soon after entering the cells, whereas when cetuximab-DOX-immuno-NPs were used, DOX efflux was reduced. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy was used to visualize the endocytosis of nanoparticles, and revealed that the fluorescence intensity of cetuximab-DOX-immuno-NPs was significantly higher than that of non-specific IgG-DOX-immuno-NPs in RKO cells. Moreover, in EGFR-under-expressing LS174 T cells, both cetuximab-DOXimmuno-NPs and Immunoglobulin G-DOX-immuno-NPs showed weak DOX fluorescence intensity, reflecting the specificity and selectivity of cetuximab-modified nanoparticles toward EGFR-overexpressing cancer cells. This study demonstrated that cetuximab modification of DOX-loaded BSA nanoparticles can increase their selectivity and reduce their toxicity. As this would decrease the side effects of these treatments in patients, this study shows that cetuximab-modified doxorubicin-loaded bovine serum albumin nanoparticles are promising candidates for targeted colon cancer therapy."
78,Detecting apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 protein expression in diabetica nephropathy rats using magnetic hydrophilic nanomaterials,2021-10-01,"Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) signaling is involved in the occurrence and progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN) renal fibrosis, yet the detection of ASK1 requires further investigation. To explore the effect of magnetic nanomaterials combined with ASK1 signaling on renal fibrosis, a DN rat model was generated. Thirty Wistar rats were randomly allocated into three experimental models: control, sham-operated, and DN model groups. Concentrations of postoperative serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured to determine the success of the DN model group. Chitosan coated magnetic hydrophilic nanomaterials (Fe3O4@CS MCNCs) were prepared by a “one-pot reaction” method, and further characterized to assess their protein adsorption properties. ASK1 protein expression was analyzed by combining conventional immunohistochemistry and Western blotting techniques with the magnetic nanomaterials. Serum Scr and BUN levels in the DN model group were significantly increased (P < 0.01), indicating that the model was successfully generated. Fe3O4@CS MCNCs were characterized and demonstrated effective hydrophilicity, magnetism, and protein adsorption capacity, highlighting its potential application in proteomic research. The detection of ASK1 protein expression was consistent with that of immunohistochemistry and Western blotting when using the magnetic nanomaterials. Furthermore, ASK1 protein expression in the DN model group was significantly increased compared with the control and sham-operated groups. In this study, magnetic hydrophilic nanomaterials were demonstrated to be feasible for protein detection. In addition, the results indicated the potential involvement of ASK1 signaling in the process of renal fibrosis in DN rats."
79,Resveratrol facilitates bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) differentiation to prevent osteoporosis via restraining of secreted frizzled-related protein 1 expression,2021-10-01,"Secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) is associated with cell differentiation, and its expression can be modulated by resveratrol. However, their impacts on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)-induced osteogenesis and ovariectomy-triggered bone loss remain unclear. Therefore, we in this study aimed to dissect the regulation of resveratrol on SFRP1, along with its sequential effects on differentiation and osteoporosis prevention of BMSCs. The SFRP1 expression in the ovariectomized (OVX) mice-originated bone tissues, BMSCs and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), during their differentiation towards osteoblasts and chondrocytes, was quantified by qRT-PCR and Western-blot. SFRP1-siRNA was applied for studying its influence on osteogenesis of BMSCs. Additionally, we evaluated the impacts of resveratrol on OVX mice and SFRP1 expression. SFRP1 was significantly up-regulated in the OVX mice-derived bone tissues and BMSCs, but gradually decreased during osteogenesis. Its expression was not significantly changed in BMSCs during their differentiation towards osteoclasts or in BMMs. The knockout of SFRP1 significantly improved mineralization potentiality, alkaline phosphatase activity and expression of several osteoblast-specific genes. Moreover, the bone loss was ameliorated in OVX mice treated with resveratrol, whose therapeutic effects were achieved by facilitating the expression of osteogenesis-associated genes while suppressing the SFRP1 expression. We also observed that the SFRP1 exerted a negative effect on osteogenesis of BMSCs and estrogen deficiency-induced osteoporosis, enabling itself to be an indicator of osteogenesis and also a molecular target for PMOP treatment. Resveratrol is a suppressor of SFRP1that can be applied as an active ingredient for treating PMOP."
80,The relationship between apolipoprotein E gene polymorphism and essential hypertension and the analysis of the efficacy of nanotechnology,2021-10-01,"The study aimed to detect the genetic polymorphism of apolipoprotein E (Apo E) in residents of Guizhou, China, explore its relationship with essential hypertension, and discuss the efficacy of nanotechnology in the treatment of hypertension. A total of 200 people in Guizhou, China were detected with Apo E polymorphisms and were divided into groups, The experimental group consists of people with essential hypertension and the control group of normal people. The SPSS 26.0 software was used to determine the correlation between Apo E gene polymorphisms and the essential hypertension risk. Logistic regression analysis was adopted to determine the risk factors of the Apo E gene for essential hypertension. Magnetic nanoparticles are used to help extract DNA, improve efficiency, and analyze the distribution of alleles in the population. The distribution frequencies of the six genotypes of E2/2, E2/3, E3/3, E3/4, E2/4, and E4/4 were 1.0%, 15.5%, 64.0%, 17.0%, 1.5%, and 1.0%, respectively, and the distribution frequencies of the three alleles of ε2, ε3, and ε4 were 9.5%, 80.3%, and 10.3%, respectively. There are more Apo E gene ε4 carriers in the experimental group than the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P <0.05). The Apo E ε4 allele carriers had higher low-density lipoprotein and Apo B levels than the Apo E ε3 and Apo E ε2 gene carriers. Family history of hypertension and Apo E ε4 were both the main risk factors for essential hypertension. This study investigated the relationship between apolipoprotein E gene polymorphism and essential hypertension, and extracted DNA by magnetic nanoparticles to help analyze the distribution of alleles in hypertension population, which could provide theoretical basis for the diagnosis and treatment of essential hypertension in Guizhou Province, China."
81,Effect of lactic-co-glycolicacid nanoparticles polymer encapsulated quercetin on hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cardiomyocyte injury and its mechanism,2021-10-01,"This study aimed to elucidate the impact of quercetin (Que)-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (PLGA-Que) on hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced cardiomyocyte (CM) injury and its mechanism. PLGA-Que was first prepared, and H/R CMs were intervened with either PLGA-Que or free Que. The results showed that both PLGA-Que and free Que could enhance H/R CM viability, inhibit apoptosis, and lower the oxidative stress response. However, PLGA-Que was more protective of H/R CMs than free Que. Subsequently, noticeably enhanced viability and reduced apoptosis of H/R CMs were determined after miR-499-5p or miR-375 up-regulation. Lastly, the inhibitor sequences of either miR-499-5p or miR-375 were transfected into PLGAQue-treated H/R CMs. The results showed that both sequences reversed the enhancement of viability and inhibition of apoptosis of H/R CMs intervened by PLGA-Que. Thus, PLGA-Que can treat H/R-induced CM injury by up-regulating miR-499-5p and miR-375."
82,Sensitive and specific detection of micrometastasis of hepatic carcinoma in peripheral blood by immunomagnetic nanobeads polymerase chain reaction,2021-10-01,"This study aims to determine the value of miR-133a-3p in diagnosing micrometastasis of hepatic carcinoma (HCC) from peripheral blood (PB) samples and dissecting the molecular mechanism (MM) of micrometastasis. We selected 70 patients with micrometastasis of HCC from our hospital between August 2014 to August 2020 for the research (Res) group and enrolled 55 patients with HCC but without micrometastasis in the control (Con) group. We collected PB samples from each participant and quantified miR-133a-3p in each sample using immunomagnetic nanobeads (IMNBs)-based PCR and RT-PCR. In contrast to the Con group, the Res group presented a significant down-regulation of miR-133a-3p in PB. The IMNBs and RT-PCR showed that miR-133a-3p exhibited the area under the curves (AUCs) of 0.882 and 0.845, specificities of 81.82% and 74.55%, and sensitivities of 85.71% and 88.57%, respectively. Due to its higher specificity and sensitivity, IMNBs were utilized. IMNBs were then used to quantify miR-133a-3p in HCC cells. Additionally, we explored the association of miR-133a-3p with PAF; miR-133a-3p was inversely correlated with AFP (r =−0.614; P <0.001). miR-133a-3p’s targeting association with MMP15 and the corresponding MM was verified and analyzed. The up-regulation of miR-133a-3p levels inhibited the migration and invasion of HCC cells, while its down-regulation yielded the opposite effect. Moreover, miR-133a-3p negatively regulated the protein level of MMP15, the migration and invasion capacity of HCC cells was greatly impacted. In short, miR-133a-3p decreased in HCC micrometastasis. The detection of miR-133a-3p by IMNBs is both specific and sensitive in diagnosing the micrometastasis. miR-133a-3p is of enormous value in diagnosing HCC micrometastasis from PB samples, and its up-regulation can inhibit MMP15 and hinder HCC metastasis."
83,Hepatotoxicity induced by intravenous administration of PEGylated nano-graphene oxide in albino mice,2021-10-01,"Graphene oxide (GO) has been intensely investigated in recent years due to its biocompatibility and its role in drug delivery. Its conjugation with polyethylene glycol (PEG) further improves its solubility in physiological solutions, which is important for enhancing efficacy of drug delivery. The present study aimed to assess the hepatotoxicity of PEG-nGO in mature mice. Liver function tests such as Alanine transferase (ALT), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were performed in the liver homogenate of the control and treated groups after intravenous administration of a single dose (5 mg/kg) of PEG-nGO through the tail vein. Total Glycogen content and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was measured. For histology studies, liver slices were fixed in 10% formalin and stained with H&E and photographed. The liver function test indicated a significant increase in ALT and ALP activity following 1 to 2 h of treatment with PEG-nGO, which recovers to normal levels at 4 h. Total glycogen contents were mobilized from the liver in the first hour in response to stress, which again regain normality after 4 h. The LDH assay showed maximum necrosis and apoptosis of hepatocytes at 1 h. Histology studies further indicated that infiltration of inflammatory cells and vacuolization of cytoplasm occurred mostly at 1 h. PEG-nGO treatments caused maximum damage and toxicity to the liver during the first 2 h. Following this, the liver tissues recover substantially which indicated that the low dose toxicity of PEG-nGO to the liver was transient and reversible."
84,The role of elevated levels of microRNA-155-5p and microRNA-124-5p in hyperuricemia and acute ischemic stroke,2021-10-01,"Hyperuricemia is closely related to acute ischemic stroke (AIS). In our study, we investigated the pattern of miRNA-155-5p and miRNA-124-5p expressions along with its clinical application in AIS and hyperuricemia patients and in a hyperuricemia rat model by RT-qPCR. The hyperuricemia rat model was established, and we found that the levels of miRNA-155-5p and miRNA-124-5p were increased in the serum, brain and kidney tissues compared with those in the normal rats. We proved that the levels of miRNA-155-5p and miRNA-124-5p were also elevated in AIS, hyperuricemia and AIS accompanied with hyperuricemia patients enrolled from the department of neurology in Inner Mongolia People’s Hospital (IMPH). The miRNA-155-5p and miRNA-124-5p were mainly associated with neuronal apoptosis, cerebral vasospasm, neuron projection, neuron projection morphogenesis, neuron differentiation and exocytosis. The above results might provide clues for the study the pathogenesis of AIS and hyperuricemia."
85,The timing of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and nano-ligation clip for acute calculous cholecystitis under guidance of Tokyo guidelines 2018 (multi-center retrospective analysis),2021-10-01,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has been recognized as the standard surgical method for cholecystectomy. A nano-absorbable ligation clip. The material used in the ligation clip is composed of basic materials (poly(p-dioxanone), poly trimethylene carbonate or polycaprolactone) and nano-short fibers (Polyglycolide acid or polylactide). The short nano-fibers maintain the crystalline form evenly dispersed in the base material. The diameter of short nano-fibers is 300–500 nm and the length is 20–50 µm. The nano-absorbable ligation clip has strong closing force and will not cause closure failure. However, there are still some controversies about the optimum time for LC treatment of acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC) patients, and the optimum time for performing LC based on evidence-based medicine has not been unanimously recognized. Here, we explore LC timing for ACC treatment under the guidance of the Tokyo Guidelines for Acute Cholecystitis 2018 (TG18). We retrospectively analyzed the data of 3,147 ACC cases undergoing LC in eight hospitals in China. According to the time from the onset of the patient’s symptoms to the operation, they were divided into the following three groups: Group A (onset to operation time of ≤3 days), Group B (onset to operation time of 4–7 days), and Group C (onset to operation time of >7 days). There was no obvious statistical difference in preoperative indicators, such as gender ratio, history of hypertension, diabetes, and abdominal operation; ASA Classification; and TG18 Classification between the three groups. Similarly, the results of preoperative laboratory indices (e.g., white blood cell, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, platelet, serum creatinine, and international normalized ratio) showed no obvious statistical difference between the three groups. The comparison of gallbladder characteristics under B-ultrasound showed no significant statistical difference between the three groups. However, the conversion rate in Group C was significantly higher than that in Groups A and B, the incidence of complications (e.g., bile leakage, bile duct injury, and wound infection) was significantly higher in Group C than that in Groups A and B, and the postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in Group A than that in Groups B and C. A comprehensive analysis of patients’ medical records in multiple medical centers confirms that it is safe and feasible to perform early LC 7 days before the onset of ACC, which can significantly decrease postoperative complications and shorten the postoperative hospital stay for ACC patients. Performing early LC for ACC patients under the TG18 guidelines is safe and feasible. Additionally, since TG18 has obvious practicability and guidance for the clinical practice of hepatobiliary surgery, it is worthy of popularization and application in China."
86, thermoresponsive curcumin-loaded dual polymeric nanoassemblies for wound healing and care of femoral fracture after surgery,2021-10-01,"Approximately 6.3 million fractures occur annually in the United States. Fractures (for example, hip fractures) occur in 2.4% population per year. A new clinical solution to this issue is the use of biomaterials with a dual purpose of bone healing and prevention of infection. In this study, advanced biomedical curcumin nanoparticles combined with a copolymeric matrix that had a dual function were developed and shown to promote antiinflammatory, functional recovery, and successful neuroprotective effects. The application of curcumin nanoparticles packaged in a thermoresponsive drug carrier device improves sustainability, bioavailability of blood, longevity, and biocompatibility. This nanocomposite showed enhancement of neuroprotection, axonal growth performance, and theoretically, functional recovery at the location of femoral fracture injury, by curcumin-primed polycaprolactone (PCL) ([email protected]). Various microscopic methods (SEM, TEM, and LS) verified the morphology and shape of the manufactured [email protected] nanoassemblies. In addition to these membranes being used at different temperatures, they improved the drug charge films and exhibited better-regulated release profiles for Cur. Thus, our data provide a simple hybrid clinical approach for the prevention and rehabilitation of femoral fractures in humans."

In the current study, we present a visual computing model of minimum spanning tree that combines advantages of DNA origami, hybridization chain reaction and nano-gold particles. Nano-gold particles were used to represent vertices and molecular beacons with fluorescent labels were used as anchor strands, which were fixed on origami substrate with staple strands according to the shape in graph. We then induced hybridization chain reaction using initiator strands and fuel strands. Lastly the problem was detected using fluorescence. The model provides a visualized calculation model of minimum spanning tree by using hybridization chain reaction and fluorescence labeling on origami bases. This model utilizes their advantages and demonstrates effectiveness of the model through case simulation. It also reduces computational complexity of the problem and improve the way of solution reading."
88,Effect of laser cladding on microstructural transformation and mechanical properties of heat affected zone of EA4T steel,2021-10-01,"In this study, laser cladding on EA4T steel was carried out. The Composition of HAZ of the EA4T steel was analyzed by OM and SEM. The effect of laser cladding on microstructural transformation of HAZ of EA4T steel was discussed. The distribution of alloying elements and the micromechanical properties of the interface were tested. The results show that the microstructures of the laser cladding heat-affected zone of the EA4T steel are mainly lath martensite. The homogenization of austenite and the dissolution of carbides near the interface are not sufficiently developed, and coarse grains are observed. In the fine-grained area of the HAZ, the microstructure is mainly composed of martensite and a small amount of sorbite with a certain orientation. In addition, among all laser cladding conditions, the highest temperature experienced in the HAZ of the EA4T steel plays a decisive role in the evolution of the microstructure and mechanical properties. A sudden change in alloying elements occurs at the junction site, and the grain orientation is clearly found. Moreover, the shear strength of the HAZ increases, whereas the degree of packing decreases."

The structure and morphology of nano-powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The luminescence properties of the nano-powders were tested by a fluorescence spectrometer. The results showed that the average particle size of the prepared WO3:Eu3+ nano powders were the smallest and reached 32 nm at pH = 1. Under different excitation wavelengths, the main emission peak of the sample was at 615 nm, corresponding to the 5D0 →7F2 electron transition of Eu3+. The emission intensity of WO3:Eu3+ nanoparticles prepared at pH = 5 was the highest at 615 nm."
90,Physical and anti-aging characteristics of nano-TiO/irganox 1010 composite modified asphalt,2021-10-01,"Asphalt aging is the main cause of fatigue failure from asphalt pavements, and it can be divided into thermaloxidative and ultraviolet (UV) aging. In this study, nano-TiO2/Irganox 1010 were added to neat asphalt to simultaneously improve the aging phenomenon of asphalt in a variety of complex conditions of asphalt. We then analyzed and discussed physical properties of nano-TiO2/Irganox 1010 modified asphalt composites. In addition, MSCR (Multiple Stress Creep Recovery) and DSR (Dynamic Shear Rheometer) rheological tests were performed on nano-TiO2/Irganox 1010 modified asphalt with different contents. Aging simulation of nano-TiO2/Irganox 1010 modified asphalt was conducted through the TFOT (The Thin Film Oven Test) and UV test, and microstructure of UV aging was analyzed through scanning electron microscopy. Data analysis showed that the nano-TiO2/Irganox 1010 increased softening point and reduced penetration (25 °C) and ductility (5 °C). The nano-TiO2/Irganox 1010 also improved the creep resistance and rheological properties of the composites. Finally, the analysis of test results under different conditions showed that the addition of nano-TiO2/Irganox 1010 significantly enhanced the ability of asphalt to deal with aging in a variety of complex environments."
91,Rare earth doped organic–inorganic hybrid polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane phosphors applied for flexible sheet and anti-counterfeiting,2021-10-01,"We have developed organic–inorganic hybrid polyhedral oligomeric silsequioxane (POSS) type monomer ligand 2,6-pyridinediamine-bis-propanylheptaisobutyl POSS (PDC-POSS) and synthesized rare earth (RE =Eu3+) doped hybrid complex PDC-POSS phosphors. The PDC-POSS precursor was prepared using (3-aminopropyl)heptaisobutyl POSS, 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid chloride (PDC) as the host material, and then coordinated with RE3+ using europium nitrate regents to synthesize PDC-POSS:Eu3+ phosphors. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the PDC-POSS:Eu3+ hybrid phosphors were detected at 592, 616, 649, 693 nm under UV light (λ= 288 nm) excitation. In addition, the synthesized hybrid phosphors showed red light emission under UV light. The phosphors were demonstrated on a flexible sheet that could be applied for red emitting LEDs, and for anti-counterfeiting, which requires the film to remain hidden and identifiable only by UV light."
92,Effects of enalapril folic acid combined with levamlodipine on incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients with essential hypertension,2021-10-01,"Essential hypertension (EP) is a chronic disease. Effective treatment of hypertension is one of most crucial preventions of cardiovascular (CV) and cerebrovascular (CBV) events. Enalapril folic acid combined with levamlodipine is an effective therapy to treat EP, but its effect on CV and CBV events in hypertensive patients is unknown. This study set out to assess the effects of enalapril folic acid combined with levamlodipine on incidence of CV and CBV events in patients with EP. We randomly assigned 172 patients with EP enrolled in our hospital between April 2017 and September 2018 to receive Levoamlodipine Maleate Dispersible Tablets alone (the control group, n = 85) or Levoamlodipine Maleate Dispersible Tablets combined with Enalapril Maleate and Folic Acid Tablets (the combination group, n = 87). All patients received basic treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment, we recorded the clinical outcomes and adverse reactions of all patients and compared the blood pressure before and after the treatment. The CV and CBV events happening in the two groups within 3 months after the treatment were also recorded. After 4 weeks of treatment, in contrast to the control group, the combination group had a higher marked response rate and lower moderate response rate and non-response rate (P <0.05). The two groups displayed no great disparity in complication rate (P >0.05). Before treatment, the two groups did not differ in pulse pressure (PP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (P >0.05). After 4 weeks of treatment, both groups showed decreased PP, DBP, and SBP (P <0.05), with lower PP, DBP, and SBP in the combination group (P <0.05). The main CV and CBC events happening in the two groups during the 3-month follow-up included heart failure, stroke, unstable angina pectoris, transient cerebral hemorrhage, acute coronary syndrome, and accelerated heart rate, devoid of fatality. The control group obtained 22 cases (25.88%) of CV and CBC events, which was remarkably higher than the combination group that had 8 cases (9.20%) (P <0.05). In conclusion, the enalapril folic acid combined with levamlodipine therapy is clinically valuable since it can better control blood pressure and reduce the incidence of CV and CBC events in patients without increasing the risk of adverse reactions."
93,Impacts of various mixing approaches towards black seed oil-alginate emulsion attributes,2021-10-01,"Black seed oil (BSO) contains thymoquinone, an active ingredient that is well-known for its antioxidant property. The bitter taste of BSO makes it challenging for the consumers, mainly children and the elderly, to consume it every day. Thus, BSO is encapsulated in alginate beads in micrometre size to enhance its palatability. This encapsulation was previously established in the lab-scale and the standard mixing method to produce a stable BSO-alginate emulsion used a magnetic stirrer coupled with a sonicator. This mixing method is not suitable for the production of BSO beads at a large scale. Hence, this research aims to investigate the impacts of various mixing methods coupled with sonication towards the BSO-alginate emulsion attributes. Four BSOalginate coarse emulsions were prepared using a magnetic stirrer (MS) as the benchmark, overhead stirrer (OS), homogeniser (H), and overhead stirrer combined with homogeniser (OSH). All the coarse emulsions were then sonicated to produce a nanoemulsion using a flow cell sonicator. The coarse emulsions were characterised in terms of dissolution time while the nanoemulsions were characterised in terms of droplet size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, conductivity and absorbance. These characteristics were statistically compared to the benchmark emulsion characteristics. MS, OS, H, and OSH coarse emulsion formation required 45, 230, 102, and 46 minutes to be produced, respectively. There were significant differences (p <0.05) between the droplet size of OSH (266.53±4.36) nm and MS (285.50±1.15) nm emulsions, indicating that the OSH emulsion was more stable. The absorbance of OSH BSO-alginate nanoemulsion was significantly lower (p <0.05) than the benchmark. In comparison to MS as the benchmark, OSH technique produced a stable emulsion in terms of lower dissolution time, droplet size, zeta potential, and absorbance."
94,Carbonation of recycled aggregate and its effect on properties of recycled aggregate concrete: A review,2021-09-01,"The over exploitation of stone quarries, the generation of construction and demolition (C&D) waste, and the steady increase in the cost of preparing additional landfill space have caused great challenges to the environment and economy. Recycled aggregate concrete (RAC), as one of the sustainable construction material, has become a research hotspot and has received widespread attention. However, the formation of weak interface transition zone (ITZ) which caused by the existence of residual old mortar will exert a negative impact on the performance of RAC. Therefore, various treatments have been proposed to enhance the properties of the residual old mortar, including mechanical treatment, soaking, carbonation and so on. And it has been proved that carbonation is an effective and sustainable way to both improve the water absorption of RA and strengthen the ITZ of RAC. So, firstly, this article is devoted to reviewing the current research on the application of carbonized RA to RAC, focusing on two parts: (1) RA: the changes of physical properties under different conditions; (2) RAC: the microstructure, workability, mechanical properties and durability of the concrete with carbonized RA. Thereafter, it is known from the summarized literatures that carbonation can improve physical properties of RA and the optimal effect can be achieved by adjusting carbonation conditions. RAC with carbonized RA has denser both new and old ITZs, the microstructure, performance of it are also improved. Finally, this work may provide a reference for the research of carbonation and the application of RA in engineering in the future."
95,Enhancing the mechanical and durability properties of fly ash-based geopolymer mortar modified by polyvinyl alcohol fibers and styrene butadiene rubber latex,2021-09-01,"This study investigated three types of fly ash-based geopolymer mortar (FAG) modified with polyvinyl alcohol fiber (PVA) or styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) latex, where the influence of PVA fibers and SBR latex on the mechanical properties and durability of FAG were studied. The sample performance was subsequently interpreted by characterizing the microstructures of modified FAG samples via the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), where the internal structural stress and modification mechanisms were clarified by microstructural analysis. The results showed that the incorporation of PVA fibers mainly promotes the mechanical properties of the samples, especially the early flexural strength, and alleviates their dry shrinkage. However, adding SBR latex to the geopolymer mortar damages the compressive strength and increases the dry shrinkage of samples while improving their freeze-thaw resistance and 28-day flexural strength. The results also show that FAGs have great sulfate resistance. Microstructural analysis reveals that while the dehydrated SBR latex is capable of forming a continuous porous film structure, the fibers also facilitate the formation of a three-dimensional network structure between the dense FAG gels; thus, a more stable geopolymer structure is formed, resulting in an improvement in the toughness and durability of the samples. Furthermore, the SBR latex promotes tight connections between the fibers and geopolymer matrix so that the bond strength between the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) is greatly enhanced."
96,Defect controls by silicon doping in non-polar a-plane AlGaN epi-layers,2021-09-01,"Deposition of high-quality Si-doped crystalline AlGaN layers, especially non-polar-grown AlGaN layers, is critical and remains difficult in preparing AlGaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs), as the Si-doping-induced variations of crystalline structures are still under exploration. In this work, structural characterizations of Si-doped Al x Ga 1−x N layers were carried out by associating with examination of their carrier recombination behaviors in photoluminescence (PL) processes, to clarify the physical mechanism on how Si doping controls the formation of structural defects in AlGaN alloy. The obtained results showed that Si doping induced extrinsic shallow donor states and increased the densities of point defects like cation vacancies. On the contrary, Si doping suppressed formation of line defects like dislocations and planar defects like stacking faults with suitable doping concentration. These results may guide further improvement of UV-LEDs based on AlGaN alloy."
97,Analysis of the relationship between preoperative serum tumor marker levels and tumor immune scores in patients with colorectal cancer based on nano-electrochemiluminescence,2021-09-01,"Surgery can be used to remove tumors from patients with colon cancer, but some patients have recurrence a short time after the tumor is surgically removed, and the disease-free survival (DFS) period is short. Therefore, if these high-risk patients can be identified as early as possible, appropriate treatment strategies can be formulated to reduce their postoperative recurrence rate. Tumor immune scores have been proven to be effective in predicting the prognosis of patients, but the scoring can only be performed after the tumor has been removed from the patient. There is still urgency to find indicators that can predict the prognosis of patients before surgery. We used electrochemiluminescence electrodes modified with nanomaterials to detect the expression of serum markers. After comparison, it was found that the contents of CEA, AFP, CA19-9, and CA125 in patients with CRC were substantially higher than those with benign colonic disease. Pearson correlation analysis showed that CEA, AFP, CA19-9, and CA125 contents are positive correlated to the patient’s tumor immune score. Further investigation found that patients with high expression of CEA, AFP, CA19-9, and CA125 had a three-year DFS rate, which was substantially lower than those with low expression. Therefore, our findings suggest that the use of the composite nano-modified electrode electrochemiluminescence method to detect the content of CEA, AFP, CA19-9, and CA125 in patients with colorectal cancer can predict DFS after surgery to a certain extent. Additionally, the perioperative data plan can be adjusted in time according to the expression of tumor markers before surgery."
98,Effect of magnetic nanoparticles containing ropivacaine on ankle nerve block in rats,2021-09-01,"Ropivacaine (RVC), a common pain management drug used for clinical anesthesia and postoperative analgesia, inhibits peripheral nociceptive pain stimulation. However, the potential neurological damage resulting from RVC use must be considered. Developing a strategy to enhance the local anesthetic effect of RVC while reducing its potential acute toxicity to the central nervous system is urgently needed. In this study, a novel RVC nanocomposite drug, magnetic iron oxide/polyethylene glycol-carboxymethyl chitosan/ropivacaine nanoparticle (mCMCS-PEG/RVC NPs), was synthesized with magnetic iron oxide. The inherent shell–core structure of mCMCS-PEG retained core magnetic properties, improved the stability and biocompatibility of magnetic nanoparticles, and avoided excessive degradation. Thus, mCMCS-PEG/RVC NPs are expected to provide a new pain management strategy for perioperative patients."
99,Use of a nano-hydroxyapatite/polyamide composite in anterior cervical subtotal corpectomy and fusion,2021-09-01,"This study aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of using nano-hydroxyapatite/polyamide (N-HA/PA) composite in anterior cervical vertebral body subtotal corpectomy and interbody fusion. Total 50 patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy were enrolled to undergo anterior cervical spondylectomy. Bone graft pedicles were compounded with N-HA/PA and intervertebral body fusion was performed. Study outcomes included surgical efficacy and the degree of fusion. Patients in whom vertebral body fusion was performed with N-HA/PA composite pedicles had significantly improved symptoms. The postoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores increased to 18.56±4.37 from 11.37±3.52, reflecting an improvement rate of 87.3%. The composite pedicle fusion rate was 96.4%. Therefore, N-HA/PA composite pedicle as a bone graft material in fusion surgery provides significant therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, the composite pedicle fusion rate is high, making it ideal for anterior cervical vertebral body subtotal corpectomy and fusion."
100,Assessment of -calcium sulfate hemihydrate/nanocellulose composite bone graft material for bone healing in a rabbit femoral condyle model,2021-09-01,"The material properties of nanocellulose (NC) can effectively enhance the structural stability of composite materials. However, the research related to NC/α-calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CSH) composites is largely lacking. In this paper, we explore the combination of these two materials and determine their elaborate biological activities in vivo. Using α-CSH as the matrix, the composite bone graft materials were produced according to different proportions of NC. Then the mechanical strength of the composite bone graft was measured, and the results were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To conduct the material in vivo evaluation, 0% (CN0) and 0.75% (CN0.75) NC/α-CSH composite bone graft materials were implanted into a femoral condyle defect model. The results indicated that NC could significantly enhance the mechanical properties of α-CSH. The SEM analysis indicated that the NC shuttled between the crystal gaps and formed a three-dimensional network structure, which was firmly combined with the crystal structure. Meanwhile, the CN0.75 scaffold remained at 12 weeks postoperation, which provided a long-term framework for new bone formation.

Paeoniflorin (PF), a monoterpene glycoside extracted from Radix Paeoniae Rubra or Paeoniae Radix Alba, can ameliorate myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI), but its mechanism is not still defined. In this study, network pharmacology was utilized, the protein interaction network between PF and MIRI targets were screened for bioenrichment analysis. Moreover, the anti-MIRI effects of PF (30, 60 and 120 mg/kg) were investigated in vivo on rats for verification. The myocardial infarction area was assessed by TTC/Evans blue staining and morphological changes of tissues were evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The contents of myocardial enzymes and oxidation resistance were measured. The cell apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL staining and the expression of proteins was estimated using Western Blot. In the results, the relevant targets and the biological processes of PF against MIRI were screened out, indicating its anti-MIRI potential pharmacological effects of PF. 120 mg/kg PF can shrink infarction area after ischemia/reperfusion, ameliorate pathological morphology in myocardial tissue, lower the levels of myocardial enzymes, and attenuate oxidative stress. Furthermore, PF could reduce the positive rate of TUNEL staining caused by MIRI. Moreover, 120 mg/kg PF could depress the protein levels of Bax, Caspase-3, Beclin-1 and Cathepsin B and increase the protein level of Bcl-2 on rats after reperfusion. In conclusion, Paeoniflorin has an anti-MIRI effect in rats via coordinate regulation of anti-oxidative stress, anti-apoptosis and inhibition of autophagy."
102,Antibacterial performance of Berberine loaded carrageenan/konjac glucomannan hydrogels,2021-09-01,"Carrageenan and konjac glucomannan are non-toxic polysaccharides which have been widely applied in the biomedical fields.

103,Effect of mixing ratio on mechanical properties of mixture of chitin nanofibers and microfibrillated cellulose reinforced PVA hybrid nanocomposites,2021-09-01,"In order to explore the possibility of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) reinforced by mixture of chitin nanofibers (ChNFs) and microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) instead of a single reinforcing phase, mechanical properties of PVA based hybrid nanocomposites reinforced with combination of ChNFs and MFC in various mixing ratios were investigated. For comparison, two different experiments were conducted to prepare nanocomposite films by casting technical processing, where ratios of ChNFs to MFC were mixed varying from 1:0, 4:1, 3:2, 1:1, 2:3, 1:4, and 0:1 in both projects, while in Project 1 the weights of PVA and ChNFs were always kept constant and the weight of PVA only was kept constant in Project 2. The results were as follows: (1) The hybrid ternary nanocomposites acquired the highest Young’s modulus and tensile strength when ratio of ChNFs to MFC was 1:1, which exhibited higher Young’s modulus and higher tensile strength than PVA/ChNFs composites, but delivered higher Young’s modulus and similar tensile strength comparing to PVA/MFC composites; (2) Aggregations and voids inside nanocomposites were detrimental to mechanical properties of PVA based hybrid nanocomposites. In some industries such as food packing, PVA based hybrid nanocomposites at mixing ratio 1:1 of ChNFs to MFC are applied presumably with ChNFs partly instead of MFC in the future."

In this study, the properties of several common rubber materials, ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM), nitrile rubber (NBR), hydrogenated nitrile rubber (HNBR), fluororubber (FKM), and acrylate rubber (ACM), were investigated under high-dose gamma-ray irradiation. The dose rate of gamma rays was 66.76 Gy/min, and the cumulative dose was 1214965.24 Gy. Oxidative decomposition of the double bond of EPDM occurred, leading to slight decreases in the strength and elongation. NBR and HNBR were mainly subjected to crosslinking of the molecular structure, resulting in small increases in strength and significant decreases in elongation. The cyano decomposition reaction occurred in ACM, and its crystallinity increased, leading to embrittlement and decreases in the strength and elongation. Oxidative decomposition and cross-linking simultaneously occurred in FKM, resulting in an increase in strength and decreases in elongation and the elastic modulus."

The structural parameters, such as lattice constant ratio, unit cell volume ratio, density, were investigated. The calculated elastic constants satisfy the born’s stability criterion, indicating that they are mechanically stable at normal and high pressure. Mechanical parameters such as bulk modulus, shear modulus, and Young’s modulus of polycrystalline materials have been derived from single-crystal elastic constants. The Poisson’s ratio and anisotropy were investigated. The results show that the B/G value of Mg2Ca is greater than 1.75, indicating it is a ductile phase under various pressures. When the pressure was equal to 40 Gpa, Al2Ca was transferred brittle to toughness, and the bulk modulus, shear modulus, and Young’s modulus of Al2Ca were all larger than those of Mg2Ca, indicating that the comprehensive mechanical properties of Al2Ca are better than those of Mg2Ca. The constant heat capacity obtained by the quasi-harmonic approximation indicates that the ability of Mg2Ca to release or store heat is greater than that of Al2Ca. Moreover, the coefficient of thermal expansion (α) increases exponentially at lower temperatures and linearly at higher temperatures for both alloys."

The obtained X-ray diffraction patterns are showed the crystalline structure. The morphology of nanocarbon capsules WC are spherical shapes and less than 10 nm size. The electrochemical properties indicate that the ORR activity in an acidic medium under saturated O2 significantly disappears in the case of the nanocarbon-encapsulated WC synthesised in the high frequency (180 kHz). The synthesized nanocarbons-encapsulated WC might be applied in data storage and energy applications."

However, the existing BWTSs often have problems in practical applications. In this study, a multiwave ultraviolet (UV)-modified TiO2 photocatalyst biological inactivation system (longwave UV, UVA+shortwave UV, UVC+vacuum UV, VUV/Cu-N-TiO2) for microorganism inactivation in ballast water was established. The results showed that the UVA+UVC+VUV/Cu-N-TiO2 system improved the UV light quantum yield and catalyst activity in the photocatalytic reaction and fully utilized the synergistic inactivation effect of Cu-N-TiO2 photocatalyst+ multiwave UV light (UVA, UVC, and VUV) on microorganisms. Compared with 8 other photocatalytic systems, the logarithmic algae removal rate and logarithmic sterilization rate of the UVA+UVC+VUV/Cu-N-TiO2 system increased to 1.78 log and 5.86 log, respectively. The turbidity of the seawater affected the microorganism inactivation to a certain extent.

As a basal lineage eukaryote, research on any neuron-like substances may contribute to our understanding of the origin of the nervous system in complex organisms. We examined the expression and localization of the neuropeptide adreno-cortico-tropic-hormone (ACTH) and the neuroprokaryotic protein (NeuN) in two species of Physarum under different culture conditions were studied by immunofluorescence and western blotting. ACTH was expressed in the cytoplasm of the plasmodium of Physarum flavicomum, and NeuN was expressed in the nuclear membrane of the plasmodium of P. polycephalum and in the cytoplasm of that of P. flavicomum. This demonstrates the occurrence of neuropeptides in the myxomycete plasmodium for the first time and contributes to the understanding of intercellular communication in Myxomycetes."
128,Study on the effect of polyethylene glycol emodin in the treatment of severe acute pancreatitis in rats,2021-08-01,"Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is a common gastrointestinal disorder requiring hospitalization. Pancreatic edema, hemorrhage, and pancreatic necrosis are potentially fatal complications. Therefore, the development of new drugs for the treatment of SAP is essential. We developed a nanocomposite drug (polyethylene glycol [PEG]-loaded emodin [EMD] liposomes [PEG-EMD Lip]) for the treatment of SAP that was constructed based on the excellent biocompatibility, non-toxicity, moisture retention, and favorable dispersive properties of PEG. In vitro experiments revealed that the effect of PEG-EMD Lip (15 μg/mL) modified by PEG on the activity of mononuclear macrophages (RAW264.7) remained above 93.3%, which was 1.12 times higher than that of EMD Lip alone. This suggests that PEG-modified EMD can effectively reduce the side effects observed with the parental drug. In addition, PEG–EMD Lip significantly decreased the levels of serum inflammatory factors, oxidative stress induced by SAP, and the degree of damage to the pancreas and lung organized system."
129,A clinical study to evaluate predictive significance of miR-513b-5p for senile cataract using nanoparticle-assisted polymerase chain reaction method,2021-08-01,"In the past few decades, increase in the global population and improvement in the overall life expectancy has been associated with an increase in the prevalence of age-related cataract. Cataracts (CA) refer to the opacification of the eye lens. It is one of the prime reasons contributing to visual impairment and blindness worldwide. The early onset of CA is relatively insidious, which stands as a major obstacle in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Previous studies have reported an aberrant expression of miR-513b-5p in the lens of the eye. Since the eye lens holds a central position in CA, the present study aimed to explore and establish the role of miR-513b-5p in clinical implications of CA using a nanoparticle-assisted polymerase chain reaction (nano-PCR) technology. The study involved two broad groups, 108 elderly CA patients (research group, or RG) and 96 normal physical examinees (control group, or CG). Nano-PCR detection method was used to examine the expression of miR-513b-5p in the two groups. An elevated expression of miR-513b-5p was recorded in RG, which declined after the treatment. ROC curve analysis of the collected data revealed that miR-513b-5p had a favorable diagnostic significance for CA. Post treatment, a positive relevance of miR-513b-5p with inflammatory factors including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) was verified by correlation analysis. The impact of miR-513b-5p on the prognosis of CA patients further established the high predictive significance of miR-513b-5p with regard to the recurrence of CA. Thus, the results of the study showed that miR-513b-5p was highly expressed in senile CA patients and it displayed a superior diagnostic significance with regard to CA. Post treatment, miR-513b-5p expression was found to be strongly linked to the expression of various inflammatory factors. In addition to these, miR-513b-5p displayed an outstanding predictive significance for the recurrence of CA. All these results highlight the suitability of miR-513b-5p to be used as a promising candidate for the diagnosis and treatment of senile CA in the future."
130,Paeoniflorin and albiflorin regulate P-gp-mediated aconitine and hypaconitine transport through an Madin Darby canine kidney-multi drug resistance protein 1 cell model,2021-08-01,"Aconitine and hypaconitine are the main active ingredients of Radix Aconiti, paeoniflorin and albiflorin are the primary components of Radix Paeoniae Alba. Both Radix Aconiti and Radix Paeoniae Alba are herbs that are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. This study sought to explore the mechanistic transport of aconitine and hypaconitine across MDCK-MDR1 cells and to assess the effect of paeoniflorin and albiflorin on aconitine and hypaconitine transmembrane transport as a potential attenuation mechanism. Drug cytotoxicity was tested via the MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, and transport studies were performed in both directions. The effects of drugs on P-gp ATPase activity, P-gp efflux function, MDR1 mRNA and P-gp expression were evaluated in MDCK-MDR1 cells. Aconitine and hypaconitine treatment with the verapamil could significantly decrease the efflux rate (ER). The ER of aconitine and hypaconitine were significantly increased with the coadministration of paeoniflorin and albiflorin, suggesting that paeoniflorin and albiflorin can promote the efflux of these two alkaloids. Aconitine and hypaconitine can induce P-gp enzymatic activity, inhibit P-gp-mediated efflux, and downregulate the expression of P-gp protein to produce cytotoxic effects. When treatment in combination with paeoniflorin and albiflorin, it could stimulated P-gp ATPase activity, increasing mRNA expression, enhance P-gp efflux function, and upregulate P-gp protein expression."
131,Nanoparticulate ophthalmic drug delivery of norfloxacin to prevent ocular infection after cataract surgery: Evaluation in animal model,2021-08-01,"Post cataract surgery, patients generally experience bacterial infection called endophthalmitis which is considered as potent blinding complication. This infection arises from the colonization of Staphylococcus epidermidis on the newly implanted lense. To overcome this problem, we developed nanoparticulate ophthalmic drug delivery of Norfloxacin to prevent ocular infection after cataract surgery. Sustained release Norfloxacin loaded polymeric nanoparticles were developed by high pressure homogenization method. The nanoparticles were characterized for particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index (PDI), encapsulation efficiency (EE), in vitro Norfloxacin release and surface characteristics using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The optimized nanoparticulate formulation was further used for the development of thermoreversible ophthalmic gel using poloxamer polymer. The formulated ophthalmic gel was evaluated for gelation temperature, pH, bioadhesiveness, and in vitro corneal permeation study. The antibacterial efficacy testing of thermoreversible gel was assessed in animal model (rabbit) infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis. At the end of study period the inhibitory effect of thermoreversible gel was determined on test animals. The antibacterial effects were compared with control group and plain thermoreversible gel (without nanoparticle formulation). The optimized nanoparticulate formulation of Norfloxacin showed slow and gradual sustained release over the period of 72 hours, encapsulation efficiency of between 90.12 to 98.50%, particle size 95–210 nm, PDI 0.18 to 0.212 and zeta potential between 20 to 25 mV. The nanoparticles were found spherical and smooth in nature. The optimized formulation of nanoparticle was used in thermoreversible gel. The results obtained showed that the thermoreversible gel was clear and transparent (prime requirement for ophthalmic product) with high gelling capacity and moderately viscous liquid (1170 cp), highest bioadhesive strength of 2312.90 dyne/cm2. The exvivo corneal study showed excellent permeation through cornea as compare to control sample. Norfloxacin released from thermoreversible gel killed Staphylococcus epidermidis in animal models as compare to control group and showed effect up to 14 days. With these findings, we demonstrate a new and effective system for sustained drug release of Norfloxacin from thermoreversible gel with specific application to prevent ocular infection after cataract surgery."
132,Early nursing care of peritoneal dialysis catheter outlet with multi-functional nanogel of antibacterial and healing,2021-08-01,"Infection at the outlet of the catheter in peritoneal dialysis (PD) is one of the leading causes of peritonitis, as well as the main cause of catheter extraction and patient mortality. The use of dressings at the outlet of the catheter is important to prevent secondary trauma and wound infection. This study reports the development of a multifunctional hydrogel dressing with antibacterial, repair, and anti-infection functionality: the dextran–curcumin silk fibroin ([email protected]) hydrogel dressing. Clinical application demonstrated that compared with standard wound dressing, [email protected] hydrogel dressing had stronger antibacterial, anti-infection, and analgesic properties, reduced the interval of dressing changes, and promoted wound healing. These results suggest that [email protected] may represent an improved option for nursing care at the outlet of PD catheters."
133,Study on scar repair and wound nursing of chitosan-based composite electrospun nanofibers in first aid of burn,2021-08-01,"Bacterial infection and oxidative stress are serious complications in emergency burn patients, as the increase of oxygen free radicals in burn wounds can aggravate vascular endothelial cell injury, make the wounds ischemic and hypoxic, and delay wound healing. Traditional dressings cannot meet the first-aid needs of burn patients. In this study, polycaprolactone/chitosan (PCL/CS) was used as an electrospun nanofiber matrix, and curcumin (CUR), a molecule with excellent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, was introduced to construct polycaprolactone/ chitosan graft copolymer-zein-curcumin electrospun nanofibers (PCL/CS-ZE-CUR). The results of clinical experiments suggest that compared with traditional dressings, based on the excellent mechanical properties and antibacterial activity of PCL/CS, the new dressing can exhibit oxygen free radical-scavenging abilities of CUR to accelerate wound healing and is expected to provide a beneficial upgrade for wound emergency care."
134,Highly efficient biphasic calcium-phosphate coating procedure with an enhanced coating yield and protein incorporation rate,2021-08-01,"A biphasic calcium-phosphate (CaP)-coating is a promising surface modification for functionalizing various endosseous biomaterials. However, its biomedical application is limited by its low coating yield and incorporation inefficiency. We developed a highly concentrated (4.5×) supersaturated calcium-phosphate solution (SCPS) and compared its physicochemical properties with those of 1× SCPS. One milliliter of 4.5× SCPS formed a thick (110 μm) continuous coating on a titanium disc (4×4×1 mm), compared to the thin (29 μm) 1× SCPScoating. On X-ray diffraction analysis, the 4.5× SCPS-coating had characteristic dicalcium-phosphate dehydrate and apatite peaks, in contrast to the apatite-only of 1× SCPS-coating. Under acidic condition (pH 4.5), the 4. × 5SCPS-coating released significantly less Ca2+ than the 1× SCPS-coating. FITC-bovine serum albumin incorporation in the 4.5× SCPS-coating (81.20±6.42%) was significantly higher than in the 1× SCPS-coating (21.86±1.90%). Thus, this modified coating procedure holds promise for biomedical applications."
135,Role of LncRNA CASC9 in oral carcinoma and its downstream gene expression and mechanism detected by nanomagnetic bead-based polymerase chain reaction,2021-07-01,"In view of the increasing incidence of oral carcinoma (OC), an in-depth understanding of the mechanism is required for future prevention and treatment. In modern medical research, the etiology of tumor diseases is mainly focused on gene changes, among which lncRNA is a trending topic. We speculated that lncRNA CASC9 may attribute to OC occurrence. To verify our conjecture, we extracted the total RNA of the research samples through nanomagnetic beads, detected the expression of CASC9 downstream genes miR-383-5p and KIF3B by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and analyzed the impact of the three on OC cells and the targeting relationship. The total RNA extracted by nanomagnetic beads were found to be able to effectively improve the PCR speed, yield and the accuracy of the results, and reduce the allergic amplification results of the samples to be tested to obtain the best results. The detection result showed high CASC9 and KIF3B expression, and low miR-383-5p expression in OC cells. Inhibition of CASC9 and KIF3B and elevation of miR-383-5p can inhibit the viability of OC cells and boost apoptosis. Through dual-luciferase reporter (DLR) assay, the targeted regulation relationship between CASC9 and miR-383-5p and between miR-383-5p and KIF3B, was determined. Rescue experiments confirmed that CASC9 was able to modulate OC cell biological behaviors by targeting the miR-383-5p/KIF3B axis. Therefore, we argue that with high expression in OC, CASC9 can enhance the proliferation and migration of OC cells and inhibit the apoptosis through targeting the miR-383-5p/KIF3B axis."
136,Study on the therapeutic and nursing effect of thrombus targeted thrombolysis mediated by recombinant plasminogen activator modified nanoparticles on stroke patients,2021-07-01,"Tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is a thrombolytic drug used for the treatment of stroke. However, it has a short half-life and a high risk of complications of cerebral hemorrhage, which complicates its use in clinical applications. In this study, polyethylene glycol and polycaprolactone were used as nano-carriers in the development of new nano-drug-recombinant plasminogen activator modified nanoparticles ([email protected]) loaded with rt-PA. Following treatment, the patients received with either conventional nursing or continuous nursing. Compared with traditional treatment and nursing, the nanoparticles had stronger thrombolytic and therapeutic effects, significantly improved the self-care recovery rate of patients, and reduced the occurrence of complications. This new mode of [email protected] drug therapy combined with continuous nursing is expected to improve the recovery and survival rates of stroke patients."
137,Porous matrix nanometric scaffold repairs rabbit tibia injury by promoting bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell osteogenic differentiation and up-regulating type I and II collagen content,2021-07-01,"To explore the effect of porous matrix nanometer scaffold on Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell osteogenic differentiation and type I and II collagen content in rabbit tibial injury. 22 rabbits, weighing 2.20–3.10 kg, were equally divided into model and treatment groups. Von Kossa was used to detect osteogenic differentiation, while Western blot detected type I and type II collagen. The bone density meter measurement software was used to assess tibial bone density. Universal material testing machine was used to detect biomechanical indicators level, while HE staining detected bone morphology. Adherent Cells growth were observed in a week; where cells clusters appeared and continued to grow 2 weeks later, and the number of osteoblasts and mineralized nodules increased significantly 3 weeks later. The collagen level in the treatment group was significantly higher than that in model group (P < 0.05). The tibia bone mineral density in model group was significantly lower at the sixth and twelfth weeks after surgery (P < 0.05). The maximum bending load and bending stiffness of model group were significantly lower than those of treatment group with higher damage degree (P < 0.05). Treatment increased the bone tissue and osteoblasts, leading to production of trabecular bone structure. No clustered regenerated bone-like tissues in model group were observed. The porous matrix nanometer scaffold can repair rabbit tibia injury possibly by promoting Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell osteogenic differentiation and increasing type I and type II collagen level."
138,Study on the removal of amyloid plaque by nano-gold in the treatment of neurodegenerative disease-alzheimer’s disease,2021-07-01,"As a complex neurological disease, the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a global challenge. Compared with traditional drug therapy, a novel therapeutic tool, inorganic nanoparticles combined with photothermal therapy (PTT) can decompose amyloid β-protein (Aβ) fibrils and inhibit Aβ aggregation, alleviating AD symptoms. In this study, MoS2@Au NPs composite nanoparticles were constructed by combining sulfhydryl-modified Au NPs and MoS2 nanosheets. In vitro experiments showed that the composite nanoparticles could degrade insoluble Aβ fibers to soluble monomers and alleviate neurotoxicity. Additionally, the excellent biocompatibility and biosafety of MoS2@Au NPs reduced the damaging effects on nerve cells, and the AD model mice benefited from the treatment with MoS2@Au NPs, which significantly improved their learning and cognitive abilities and thus reduced the disease. More importantly, [email protected] NPs combined with PTT effectively curbed the inflammatory response and slowed down the course of AD."
139,Experimental study on nuclear-targeted plasmid-based short hairpin RNA (ShRNA) to hypoxia inducible factor-1 (PshHIF-1) PshHIF-1 nano-drug carrier system for breast cancer treatment in rats,2021-07-01,"This study was aimed at exploring the regulatory mechanism of auclear-targeted pshHIF-1α nano-drug carrier system (NPNCS) in the treatment of breast cancer in rats. MDA-MB-231 cell was cultured and DJ-1 and PTEN mRNA level was detected by qRT-PCR along with analysis of cell viability by CCK-8 and apoptosis by means of flow cytometry. The rats were assigned into control group, nuclear-targeted pshHIF-1α nanopharmaceutical system treatment group, and nuclear-targeted pshHIF-1α nano-pharmaceutical system+PTEN inhibitor SF1670 group, followed by analysis of cell proliferation by EdU staining, cell apoptosis by flow cytometry, and the levels of DJ-1, PTEN, and p-AKT. Compared with MDA-MB-231 cells treated with NPNCS, cells without intervention showed decreased PTEN and increased DJ-1 level. NPNCS induced cell apoptosis. Administration of nuclear-targeted pshHIF-1α nano-drug delivery system down-regulated DJ-1 and up-regulated PTEN. Combined treatment with SF1670 promoted p-AKT level and decreased the inhibitory effect of NPNCS on p-AKT level. In conclusion, the nuclear-targeted pshHIF-1α nano-drug delivery system down-regulated DJ-1 and exerted a tumor suppressor and pro-apoptotic effect, which wasrelated to p-AKT phosphorylation and up-regulation of PTEN."
140,Effect of acupuncture anesthesia based on nanomaterial sensor on cognitive function after one-lung ventilation thoracotomy,2021-07-01,"In this work, a new type of nanomaterial sensing acupuncture needle was developed to improve patient comfort and treatment effectiveness. Based on the convenient electrochemical casting process, multilayer nano-tapered holes were constructed on the needle surface to form a porous nano-sensing acupuncture needle (PNAN), which further increases the interface area of the acupuncture needle. To evaluate the effect of PNAN-induced anesthesia on cognitive function after one-lung ventilation and thoracotomy, 60 patients with esophageal cancer undergoing thoracotomy were randomly divided into an acupuncture-induced anesthesia (AIA) group and a conventional anesthesia (CA) group. The recovery time for cognitive function and the incidence of cognitive impairment in the PNAN-induced anesthesia group after one-lung ventilation and thoracotomy were significantly lower than those of the CA group (P < 0.05). The scores from the Mini Mental State Examination Scale (MMSE) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) for the AIA group were lower than the preoperative scores and were better than those for the CA group (P < 0.05). In addition, after one-lung ventilation and thoracotomy, the concentrations of cytokines and catecholamines (CAs) in both groups were lower than the preoperative values, and the levels of cytokines and CAs in the AIA group were significantly lower than those of the CA group. Therefore, acupuncture anesthesia based on a nanomaterial sensor can significantly improve the cognitive function of patients after one-lung ventilation and thoracotomy, inhibit inflammatory factors, and provide an optimal curative effect."
141,Construction of high sensitivity electrochemiluminescence sensor and its application in NT-proBNP detection,2021-07-01,"Amino terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is an important biomarker for clinical diagnosis, risk stratification, prognosis evaluation, and efficacy monitoring in patients with acute and chronic heart failure. Traditionally, NT-proBNP detection is based on immunochromatography, which is time-consuming, tedious, requires professional-trained operators, etc. Here we developed a simple, fast, unlabeled, highly sensitive, and low-cost carbon nanotubes (CNTs)@Au NPs-modified electrochemiluminescence NT-proBNP sensor, and evaluated its feasibility in the clinical monitoring of cardiac function in patients with heart failure. Notably, the sensor has a small batch size difference and good reproducibility and can be used for mass production. The device offers a new opportunity and direction for the clinical monitoring of NT-proBNP."
142,Effect of enhanced recovery after surgery management combined with nano-antibacterial dressing during perioperative nursing practice on rehabilitation of patients with gynecological tumor,2021-07-01,"The nano-silver antibacterial dressing is processed and formed after being expanded and cut by medical degreased gauze and nano-silver solution. The nano-silver content is 0.4%–1.0% of the dressing mass (the nano-silver content per square meter of the dressing is 0.28–0.7 g). Nano silver plays an auxiliary role in reducing wound infections. This study is the first to report the rehabilitative effect of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) management combined with nano antibacterial dressing in the perioperative period of gynecological cancer. The times until first exhaust, first defecation, ambulation, and the duration of hospitalization of the ERAS group were shorter than in the regular group. The VAS scores at 6 and 12 h after operation in the ERAS group were lower than those in the regular group. The levels of self-responsibility, self-concept, self-care skills, and health knowledge in the ERAS group were higher than those in the regular group. The total incidence of complications in the ERAS group was 9.09%, which was lower than that in the regular group (23.64%). The level of satisfaction with nursing care in the ERAS group was 98.18%, which was higher than that in the regular group (83.64%). The findings confirmed that ERAS combined with nano antibacterial dressing can promote the rehabilitation of patients, relieve pain, strengthen the self-care ability of patients, reduce the occurrence of complications, and improve satisfaction with nursing care."
143,"Synthesis, spectral, molecular modeling, biological and antitumor studies of new nifuroxazide complexes",2021-07-01,"Series of Zr(IV), Ce(IV) and U(VI) complexes were synthesized with nifuroxazide ligand. Design and formulae of the complexes suggested in the light of analytical, spectral, magnetic and thermal analyses (1 HNMR, IR, UV-Vis). The calculated values of molar conductance mean that, all isolated complexes were electrolytes. The data revealed the complexes formation and suggested that nifuroxazide binds as a bidentate at NO sites with metal ions. The kinetic parameters evaluated using Coats Redfern (CR) and Horowitz-Metzeger (HM) methods. The thermodynamic data reflect the thermal stability for all complexes. The calculated bond length and force constant values for UO2 bond are 1.741 Å and 459.409 Nm−1. The research investigations were related to quantum chemical calculations conducted at the theory level of DFT/B3LYP/LANL2DZ. The nifuroxazide, inorganic salts and their metal complexes were assayed against different bacterial species as well as the in vitro growth inhibitory activity against human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) and HCT-116 cell lines. Zr(IV) complex was found to have the highest activity against all the tested organisms and a powerful anti-cancer drug."
144,Multifunctional double network hydrogel film for skin wound healing,2021-07-01,"Skin wound management is an important issue in the medical community. Herein, we report a multifunctional film with many advanced features as a dressing for the healing of wounds. The dressing was made using chitosan and poly(acrylamide) (pAAm) hydrogel in order to form a double network (DN) hydrogel film. Compared to the pure chitosan hydrogel, which is fragile, the added pAAm network conferred excellent mechanical capability to the composite film, making it flexible and easy to treat. By further doping the hydrogel with carbon nanotubes and drugs, the film could promote wound healing. Animal experiments demonstrated that the DN hydrogel film could reduce inflammation and promote tissue regeneration. Thus, this film is promising as a treatment for wound healing."
145,Decellularized human amniotic particles reinforced with GelMA assist wound healing of the oral mucosa ,2021-07-01,"Defects within the oral mucosa can result from a variety of causes, including tumors and trauma. Adults have limited ability to regenerate after tissue loss or injury, meaning autografts to reconstruct defects are often required. Due to shortcomings associated to tissue transplantation, the use of tissue engineering technology to reconstruct and regenerate oral tissues has gained attention. In this regard, HAM (human amniotic membrane) was utilized as a biological material for tissue engineering applications. However, its unfavorable properties have limited its use, and hybrid scaffolds based on HAM have been investigated. Thus, in this study, a biomimetic hybrid scaffold composed of gelatin methacryloyl and decellularized human amniotic particles (GelMA-dHAP) was prepared and used as a tissue substitute to promote wound healing of the oral mucosa in rabbits. First, the degradation and swelling characteristics of the scaffold were evaluated and found to be more desirable than those of GelMA alone. Then, the effects of the GelMA-dHAP stent on the proliferation and differentiation of human foreskin fibroblasts were studied in vitro using a cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) and immunofluorescence, respectively. This showed that the hybrid scaffold could significantly promote fibroblast proliferation and differentiation in comparison to controls. Following these initial assessments and to better understand the underlying mechanism of wound healing, in vivo histological and immunohistochemical studies were undertaken using a rabbit oral mucosa defect model. The results showed that GelMA-dHAP can promote angiogenesis and collagen expression within the oral mucosa. Importantly, the GelMA-dHAP scaffold was shown to assist wound healing better than GelMA alone, demonstrating the potential of the hybrid scaffold in tissue engineering."
146,A novel fast-releasing formulation containing curcumin and anti-microbial peptide-encapsulated transdermal hydrogels into microneedles to reduce inflammation in the therapy of neonatal sepsis,2021-07-01,"Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of neonatal mortality worldwide. Typically, intramuscular injections of gentamycin and vancomycin have been the preferred treatment for sepsis. The use of these drug molecules has many complications because of some side effects, proper dosage calculations, and harmless injection supply. In the present study, we developed new combinations of therapeutic drug molecules containing anti-inflammatory curcumin with bioactive antimicrobial peptides (AMP). We designed and developed a biocompatible and thermally responsive chitosan/polyacrylamide polymeric microneedle array to deliver AMP/curcumin nanoparticles (Nano-Cur) transdermally. The prepared drug-loaded microneedles were investigated for their chemical and morphological structure, in vitro insertion, and transdermal drug release. This investigation established that AMP/Nano-Cur-loaded microneedles have potential effects in sepsis treatment."
147,Analysis of bone metabolism mechanisms in postmenopausal females with type 2 diabetes and DKK1 gene polymorphisms and the effects of polymer nanomaterials on wound infection in patients,2021-07-01,"Diabetic patients are prone to abnormal bone metabolism. Menopausal women exhibit reduced estrogen secretion and bone absorption exceeds the rate of bone formation. Therefore, postmenopausal women with diabetes are even more likely to suffer from osteoporosis. Identifying the specific mechanism of abnormal bone metabolism in diabetic menopausal women will help reduce the risk of bone fractures. This study explored the specific mechanisms of bone metabolism disorders in menopausal women with type 2 diabetes in relation to genetic polymorphisms. We found that the distribution frequency of the CA genotype and A allele at the rs1373004 locus of the DKK1 gene in menopausal women with diabetes and abnormal bone mass were significantly lower compared with that in normal bone. The distribution of the GG genotype at the rs1528877 locus was also less frequent compared with those exhibiting normal bone mass. This suggests that the genotype and allele frequency distribution in the DKK1 gene at rs1373004 and RS1528877 in postmenopausal T2DM women is associated with glucose metabolism and bone metabolism. To analyze the efficacy of polylactic acid (PLA)/gelatin nanofibers on T2DM patients with infectious fractures, we compared various aspects of wound healing in patients treated with conventional therapy versus PLA/gelatin nanofibers. The results indicated that the number of days required for wound healing and the frequency of incisions in patients treated with PLA/gelatin nanofibers were significantly lower compared with those treated with conventional therapy (P < 0.05). The wound healing rate of patients treated with PLA/gelatin nanofibers was significantly higher compared with that of patients treated with conventional therapy on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 of treatment. Our findings indicate that PLA/gelatin nanofiber treatment can significantly promote fracture wound healing."
148,Anti-Alzheimer’s disease performance of triptolide nanoliposomes modified with lactoferrin,2021-07-01,"According to the immune inflammation theory of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), triptolide (TP) is a potential drug for the treatment of AD, but it distributed widely in vivo resulting in the multi-organ toxicity. In order to improve the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of TP, stealth brain-targeting TP nanoliposomes (Lf-TP-PL) were prepared with polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-modified and lactoferrin (Lf) as the brain-targeting head group. Compared with TP solution (TP-S), common TP nanoliposomes (TP-CL) and PEG-modified TP nanoliposomes (TP-PL), the effect of Lf-TP-PL on the growth of PC12 cells inductively damaged by Aβ1-42, as the model in vitro AD cells, was studied. The effects of Lf-TP-PL on the behavioral ability of AD model mice were evaluated by Morris water maze test. The results showed that compared with TP-S, TP-CL, and TP-PL, Lf-TP-PL had stronger abilities to repair the PC12 cells inductively damaged by Aβ1-42, and could mitigate spatial memory deficit of AD model mice in a better way. Lf-TP-PL is a potential nanomedicine for AD treatment."
149,"The effects of probiotic supplementation on renal function, inflammation, and oxidative stress in diabetic nephropathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials",2021-07-01,"Whether supplemental probiotic therapy improves clinical outcomes in diabetic nephropathy (DN) patients remains unclear. To uncover its impacts via meta-analysis, relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were searched by means of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science as of August 31, 2020. The effect of probiotics was reported on renal function biomarkers, oxidative stress, inflammation, and serum albumin (ALB) levels among DN patients. Random- or fixed-effects models were used to estimate pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs). Seven RCTs (456 patients) were included for final analysis. The results showed that probiotic supplementation led to a significant increase in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (SMD: 6.03; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.84–11.21; P =0.020), glutathione (GSH) levels (P < 0.001), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (P < 0.001). In contrast, probiotic intake significantly decreased the serum creatinine (SCr) (P = 0.020), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (P < 0.001), malondialdehyde (MDA) (P = 0.020), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (P < 0.001) contents. Serum Na, K, ALB, and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations showed no significant change. Probiotics are beneficial for DN patients through improving renal function and regulating the levels of inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers. However, probiotics do not significantly affect serum ALB, NO, Na, and K levels. These results need to be confirmed through more reliable RCTs."
150,Effect of alendronate sodium on chondrocytes in joint inflammation through down-regulation of microRNA-184 (miR-184),2021-07-01,"Chondrocytes participate in the progression of osteoarthritis (OA). Alendronate (ALN) can significantly improve the pathological changes of knee arthritis. However, whether alendronate affects chondrocytes of knee arthritis remains unclear. In this paper, the articular chondrocytes were assigned into model group. The inflammation cell model group was prepared using 10 ng/mL IL-1β, the alendronate group was co-cultured with 10 ng/mL IL-1β and 10 ng/mL ALN, and the miR-184 group was transfected with miR-184 siRNA on the basis of an inflammation model followed by the analysis of miR-184, BMP-2 and BMP-4 expression by real-time PCR, IL-1β and IL-22 levels were assayed by means of ELISA, Treg cells were detected by flow cytometry, IL-35 and TGF-β levels were checked by means of real-time PCR and western blot, and Wnt3, Wnt4 and β-Catenin protein levels were investigated by means of western blot. After alendronate and miR-184 siRNA were applied to the arthritis rat model, Treg cells was significantly decreased, IL-35 and TGF-β mRNA and secretion were reduced, miR-184 was down-regulated, BMP-2 and BMP-4 were upregulated, along with decreased IL-1β and IL-22 levels and expressions of Wnt3, Wnt4 and β-Catenin (P < 0.05). Alendronate inhibits Wnt/β-Catenin pathway by down-regulating miR-184, Treg cell and cytokines secretions these cytokines upregulate BMP-2 and BMP-4 in articular chondrocytes, and inhibits inflammatory factors secretion, thus ameliorating the progression of chondrocyte inflammation."
151,The preventive effect of dexmedetomidine combined with nalbuphine on fentany-linduced hyperalgesia after nanocarbon laparoscopic hysterectomy,2021-07-01,"This study aimed to explore the preventive effect of dexmedetomidine combined with nalbuphine on fentany-linduced hyperalgesia after nanocarbon laparoscopic hysterectomy. A total of 172 patients diagnosed with cervical cancer and undergoing nanocarbon laparoscopic hysterectomy at Second Hospital of Lanzhou University from February 2017 to October 2019 were selected and divided into a control group (Group C), patients treated with dexmedetomidine (DEX) combined with nalbuphine as the combined group (Group M), the dexmedetomidine group (Group D), and the nalbuphine group (Group N). The imaging and detection rate of sentinel lymph nodes traced by carbon nanoparticles (CNP) was observed and counted, the sedation score and visual analog score (VAS), mechanical pain threshold 24 h before and after the operation, mean arterial pressure (MBP) at each time, heart rate (HR), and adverse reactions were all recorded. The results showed that the total detection rate, sensitivity, and accuracy of CNP tracer sentinel lymph nodes were 97.67%, 90.47%, 95.34%, and 97.67%, respectively. The sentinel and black-stained lymph nodes removed after surgery did not fade. The time of recovery, the HR after intubation, pneumoperitoneum, and extubation in group D were significantly different from the other three groups (P < 0.05). The pain threshold, MBP P < after intubation, and VAS scores at T0–T3 were significantly different from those in other groups (P < 0.05); the Ramsay sedation score was higher in group D than T0–T2 (P < 0.05); the time of first analgesia, the amount of sufentanil, and the number of analgesic pump compressions in group C were significantly different from those in other groups (P < 0.05). The incidence rate of bradycardia in group D was 48.83%, and that of postoperative chills in group C was 30.23%, which was significantly different from other groups (P < 0.05). Therefore, DEX combined with nalbuphine based on nano-carbon laparoscopic hysterectomy could reduce remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia and postoperative side effects, which provided a reference for the prevention of hyperalgesia."
152,Protective effects of miR-34b and miR-337 against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats by liposomal nano-delivery system,2021-07-01,"Although a few microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/RI), their exact roles in this process, and the mechanisms involved have not been fully elucidated. This study was carried out to investigate the protective effects of miR-34b and miR-337 against MI/RI. For this purpose, 56 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into two groups: sham operation group and myocardial MI/RI group, with 28 rats in each group. Then, a rat model of MI/RI was established. Changes in myocardial tissues of the two groups were determined using hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) staining. Serum level of myocardial troponin c(TnT) was assayed with ELISA method, while myocardial tissue mRNA expressions of miR in the two groups was determined with qRT-PCR. Results showed that the rat model of MI/RI was successfully established, as was evident in myocardial cell necrosis, disorganized myocardial fibers, interstitial edema, and neutrophil infiltration. There were significant increases in serum troponin content and mRNA expression levels of miR-337 and miR-34b in tissues. In conclusion, the expression levels of miR-337 and miR-34b are increased in myocardial tissues of rats with MI/RI. Thus, miR-337 and miR-34b may be involved in the pathogenesis of MI/RI via regulation of NOX4 and Samd7, respectively. Finally, by using liposomal nanocarrier, the therapeutic effect of miR-337 and miR-34b on MI/RI was investigated."
153,Comparative analysis of different drug delivery methods of injectable hydrogel nanomaterials of insulin biomaterials via multiple daily injections and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children,2021-07-01,"The aim of this study was to investigate the difference between multiple daily injections (MDI) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in blood glucose control during the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in children. under the nano-hydrogel delivery carrier. In order to improve the efficiency and therapeutic effect of the experiment, this paper adopts injectable nanomaterial-polymer composite hydrogel as drug delivery system to cooperate with insulin injection to improve the effective utilization of drugs. Eighty children diagnosed with T1DM by the department of Endocrinology, Genetics, and Metabolism of INNER MONGOLIA BAOGANG Hospital from October 2018 to December 2019 were selected as research subjects for this study. The children were randomly divided into MDI group (treated with MDI) and CSII group (treated with CSII), with 40 children in each group. The basic data of the children were compared, and changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at admission and 1, 2, and 3 months after treatment were detected. During the detection, the blood glucose level, therapeutic time of blood glucose normalization, and daily insulin dosage were recorded. The HbA1c and fasting blood glucose (FBG) were followed up three months after discharge, and incidences of hypoglycemia in the two groups were observed. The results showed that the mean value of HbA1c in the MDI group was higher than that in the CSII group (P < 0.05). Each patient was assessed for the number of times their blood sugar was allowed to dip below normal levels; patients with less hypoglycemia had a higher rate of blood sugar control. The control rates of blood glucose in the MDI and CSII groups were 19.21% and 23.50%, respectively. The CSII group showed significantly higher blood glucose rates than the MDI group (P < 0.05). The therapeutic time of blood glucose normalization in the MDI group was significantly longer than that in the CSII group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the average daily insulin dosage between the MDI and CSII groups (P > 0.05), which indicated that CSII therapy had significant advantages in reducing blood glucose in children with T1DM."
154,Exploring molecular mechanism of novel liposomal nanoparticles application in glioma,2021-07-01,"This study investigated whether miR-509 plays a role in regulating autophagy and apoptosis-related caspase 3 genes, and analyzes targeted nanoparticles intervention in glioma cells. The surgically resected glioma tissue specimens were included as observation group, and control group used a 2-cm open tissue next to the glioma followed by analysis of miR-509 and caspase 3 level by qPCR. Glioma cell line U251 was divided into miRNC group, targeted nanoparticle group, siRNA-NC group, and siRNA-caspase 3 group, followed by analysis of caspase 3 expression, cell proliferation by flow cytometry, and cell invasion and metastasis by trans well. Caspase 3 mRNA expression was significantly higher in glioma tissues compared with controls. Lower miR-509 and higher caspase 3 expression were correlated with TNM stage. Caspase 3 mRNA level was significantly higher and miR-509 was lower in glioma cells or glioma ell line U251 than those in normal cells. Transfection of siRNA-caspase 3, targeted nanoparticles effectively reduced cell proliferation, metastasis, and invasion and down-regulated caspase 3 levels in U251 cells. Reduced miR-509 expression was associated with elevated caspase 3 expression and enhanced invasive metastatic capacity of glioma cells. Overexpression of miR-509 can effectively reduce cell proliferation, metastasis, and invasion by targeted nanoparticles inhibiting caspase 3 expression."

156,Paramagnetic block copolymers: An effective tool for targeted radiography of rheumatoid arthritis,2021-07-01,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by erosive arthritis. Accurate diagnosis of RA mostly depends on the quality of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To obtain stable and clear imaging signals, it is necessary to design and develop a superstable and highly sensitive contrast agent. This study synthesized a diblock polymer polyethylene glycol–tert-butyl polyacrylate (PEG-b-PAA) by in situ polyol polymerization, coated it with ultrasmall paramagnetic iron oxide (USPIO), and conjugated folic acid to the PEG-b-PAA/USPIO surface to impart targeting function. The addition of USPIO effectively enhanced MRI quality in delayed T2-weighted images (T2WI), as observed through synovial signal changes other than morphological changes, early monitoring RA lesions, and drug treatment response. Enhanced T2WI helped evaluate the characteristics of synovial perfusion, which further confirmed the feasibility of MRI using FA-PEG-b-PAA/USPIO. These results showed that FA-PEG-b-PAA/USPIO has great potential in the clinical application of MRI for RA diagnosis."
157,Inhibitory effect of the Nth gene on drug resistance in ,2021-07-01,"To clarify the role of Nth gene in drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), the clinical strain MTB were isolated and cultured from the sputum of pulmonary tuberculosis patients, and grouped according to the results of drug sensitivity tests. The expression levels of Nth mRNA and protein were detected by Polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively. The bacteriophage-mediated homologous recombination gene knockout method and seamless cloning and ligation technology were used to knockout Nth gene and perform backfill overexpression experiments on MTB standard strain H37Rv. The resistance of the obtained strains was induced, and its growth was compared. In the results, the resistance rate of 193 clinical isolates to first-line drugs was 37.37%. The expression levels of Nth mRNA and protein in sensitive strains were higher than those in drug-resistant strains (P < 0.05). Strains without Nth were more likely to grow, while the growth of the Nthoverexpressing strain was inhibited. When two drugs are used in combination, the bacteria developed drug resistance later than those induced by single drug. In conclusion, the Nth gene has an inhibitory effect on the drug resistance of MTB."
158,Targeting grainyhead-like transcription factor 2/Snail2 with chitosan-lipid nanoparticles inhibits melanoma progression,2021-07-01,"The grainyhead-like transcription factor 2 (GRHL2) has been reported to be involved in the progression of several malignant tumors; however, its expression and function are still unclear. This study confirmed that GRHL2 expression increased in melanoma tissue and cell lines. We used a novel chitosan-lipid nanoparticle (CS-LNP) nanomaterial to form CS-LNP/plasmids and CS-LNP/siRNAs to upregulate/downregulate GRHL2. The results indicated that GRHL2 promoted melanoma cell proliferation and migration by upregulating the EMT-related snail2 gene, and GRHL2 function in melanoma cells was partially reversed by snail2 knockdown. GRHL2/snail2 could be a potential target in melanoma treatment."
159,Effect of deep tempering on microstructure and mechanical properties of G13Cr4Mo4Ni4V steel,2021-07-01,"By means of the post heat treatment of deep tempering on the aviation bearing steel G13Cr4Mo4Ni4V after quenching and high-temperature tempering, the effect of the treatment on microstructure and mechanical properties of the steel was studied. Results show that, the deep tempering promotes the precipitation of carbides along the boundaries and on the bodies of martensite blocks. In this process, the block martensite structure is decomposed and refined. After three or more times of deep tempering treatments, the hardness of the steel is slightly improved due to the carbide precipitation on the boundaries and bodies of the martensite blocks and the growth of carbides. After 5 times of deep tempering treatments, the impact toughness and the elongation of the samples are slightly reduced, while the tensile strength is increased. The area of the crack propagation zone on the rotating-bending fatigue fracture increases, while that of the transient fracture zone decreases. The ultimate strength of the rotating-bending fatigue is increased from 560 MPa to 660 MPa, with the increased extent of 17.8%, which results from the decomposition and refinement of martensite blocks."
160,Experimental study of nanoelectroplating steel spot welding structure under impact tensile-shear loading,2021-07-01,"The tensile shear fracture behavior of solder joints under impact load influences the whole vehicle’s safety substantially. This paper takes the QP980 steel resistance spot welding (RSW) structure as the research object to study the tensile-shear fracture behavior of the RSW structure under tensile-shear loading. The microstructure observation of the welded spot shows that the metallographic structure is the martensite. The porosity defects in the melting zone are the primary defect reflecting the obvious plate-cracks on both sides of the nugget. The paper demonstrates the Vickers hardness test result of the spot-welded zone. According to the test, the micro-hardness distribution result shows that the higher the martensite, the greater the hardness. A softened zone emerges adjacent to the heat-affected zone on the welded base material interface. The quasi-static and dynamic tensile-shear tests on the QP980 steel RSW lap-joint specimens show that the fracture on the BM is adjacent to the welded spot under quasi-static loading but close to the heat-affected zone under dynamic loading. Under dynamic loading, the weld seam and softened zone of the welded spot have a direct influence on the fracture. On the recovered specimen’s fractured section, there are a large number of apparent dimples on the section of the BM under quasi-static loading and the section of the HAZ under dynamic loading with nucleation, growth, and aggregation of cavitation, resulting in ductile fracture."
161,Nickel-phosphorus-boron amorphous alloy nanotubes improves the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol,2021-07-01,"Ni–P–B (NPB) amorphous alloy nanotubes were prepared for the selective liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. The content of P in NPB amorphous alloy nanotubes was adjusted by the initial NaH2PO2-containing liquid crystal system of non-ionic/anionic mixed surfactants. The promotion effect of an appropriate amount of P was mainly characterized by its large active surface area, ability for greater absorption of H, strong synergistic interaction, better stability, high conversion and catalytic selectivity. The NPB nanotubes exhibited higher hydrogenation activity when compared with the corresponding NPB nanoparticles, which might be dependent on the specific surface area, uniform active sites and tubular morphology of the catalysts."
162,Synthesis and characterization of methyltetrahydrophthalic anhydride esterified corn starch by wet method,2021-07-01,"The main purpose of this paper is to synthesize a novel esterified starch with an alicyclic structure. Herein, methyltetrahydrophthalic anhydride (MeTHPA), an alicyclic anhydride, was used to synthesize esterified corn starch (CS) with different degrees of substitution (DS) by a wet method. Compared with CS, the crystallinity and thermal degradation temperature of MeTHPA esterified CS (MeCS) decreased, while the hydrophobicity and light transmittance of MeCS films increased. The esterification modification significantly improved the toughness of the starch film. Between CS and MeCS films, the 15% Me/CS film shows a maximum elongation at break of 24.2% and a tensile strength of 8.0 MPa. Furthermore, 15% Me/CS was blended with CS as a sizing agent for polyester/cotton blended yarns and showed significantly increased adhesion to the blended yarns. Hence, the CS blended MeCS has a potential application in wrap sizing."
163,Triple functions of polyaniline in situ coated on silver powders for high-performance electrically conductive pastes,2021-07-01,"Silver powders, with high electrical conductivity, as the conductive fillers of electrically conductive adhesives have been widely investigated in the fields of microelectronic packaging. Herein, polyaniline (PANI)-coated silver powders were successfully fabricated via a facile chemical reduction, followed by the polymerization of aniline. The PANI plays triple functions to synergistically improve the performance of electrically conductive pastes as follows: (1) The aniline-coated silver particles are used as an ideal dispersant to substitute polyvinyl pyrrolidone and polyethylene glycol in the preparation strategy of silver powders; (2) The polymerization of aniline plays a surface modifier role instead of silane coupling agents to prepare silver-based conductive adhesives with homodisperse silver powders; (3) The high conductivity of PANI could reduce the contact resistance between silver powders and decrease the electrical resistivity of conductive adhesive films significantly. As a result, the PANI coats silver powders (pH = 3) show a decreased electrical resistivity of conductive adhesive films of 4.24×10−5 Ω·cm with the shear resistance of 9.06 MPa and the sheet resistance of 10.6 mΩ.sq−1. This work provides an efficient way to controllably synthesize PANI-coated silver powders for high-performance electrically conductive pastes."
164,Comparative study on crystallinity of laser-annealed polysilicon thin films for various laser sources,2021-07-01,"In this study, we compared the crystallinities of polycrystalline silicon thin films annealed using green laser annealing (GLA) with a 532-nm pulsed laser, near-ultraviolet laser annealing (NULA) with a 355-nm pulsed laser, and blue laser diode annealing (BLDA) with 450-nm continuous-wave (CW) lasers. Three-dimensional heat transfer simulations were performed to obtain the temperature distributions in a 100 nm-thick amorphous silicon layer, and optimum laser conditions were determined for each laser annealing. GLA, NULA, and BLDA experiments were conducted based on the thermal simulation results, and the crystallinity of the annealed samples was quantitatively analyzed via spectroscopic ellipsometry. The analysis results indicated that GLA and BLDA resulted in good crystallinity that was comparable to the result of furnace annealing, whereas NULA resulted in a relatively poor crystal quality. The difference in the crystallinities produced by the annealing lasers could be explained using the thermal simulation results. This study provides an insight into the optimum laser annealing conditions for realizing high-quality poly-silicon thin films."
165,Expression and role of miR-637 before and after lymphadenectomy for thyroid carcinoma,2021-07-01,"Thyroid carcinoma (TC) is a common endocrine malignancy that can be partially relieved by surgery, but its recurrence rate remains high. It is speculated that miR-637 exerts certain influence in its occurrence and development. Accordingly, we included 87 TC patients and 72 concurrent healthy controls as the research participants and purchased human papillary thyroid carcinoma cells with which to study and analyze the biological significance of miR-637. The determination of miR-637 and SH2B1 in peripheral blood and tissues was performed using nanoparticle-assisted polymerase chain reaction assay, and the identification of cell proliferation and apoptosis was made by MTT, Transwell, and flow cytometry. The results indicated that after transfection of miR-637 into TPC-1, the cell proliferation and invasion capacities in the mimics-miR-637 group were significantly reduced as compared to that of the inhibition-miR-637 and negative control (NC)-miR groups (P < 0.05). While transfection of SH2B1 into TPC-1 cells led to significantly enhanced cell proliferation and invasion capacities in sh-SH2B1 group than in si-SH2B1 and NC groups (P < 0.05). Finally, a double luciferase reporter assay identified enormously inhibited fluorescence activity of SH2B1-WT by mimics-miR-637. According to the experimental results, it is concluded that miR-637 expression was low in TC but increased after lymphadenectomy for TC. Moreover, by targeting SH2B1, miR-637 interferes with TC progression, which carries significant implications for future diagnosis and treatment of the disease."
166,Research progress of ceramic particles reinforced Al-based composites with micro-nano-scale and high volume fraction,2021-06-01,"Al-based composites reinforced by high volume fraction ceramic particles have attracted much attention because of their high specific strength, high specific modulus, good wear resistance, and low thermal expansion properties.

168,MicroRNA-7 agomir is a potential bioactive material for breast cancer therapy by inhibiting breast cancer stem cell tumorigenicity,2021-06-01,"Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) have been proven to be the root of development, metastasis and recurrence of breast cancer. It is crucial to explore the underlying paths of regulating BCSCs for breast cancer treatment. Many bioactive materials have been developed to modify therapeutic drugs or as drug delivery vehicles for tumor treatment. In this study, we aimed to probe the effect of microRNA-7 (miR-7) agomir, a potential bioactive material, in breast cancer treatment by reducing tumorigenicity of BCSCs. Magnetic activated cell sorting was used to isolate the BCSCs from the MDA-MB-231 and LD cells. Protein array was performed to screen differentially expressed proteins. The expression levels for miR-7 and CD44 in human breast cancer cell lines were detected by Quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR), Western blot (WB) and Flow cytometry (FCM) assays. Lentiviral recombinants were constructed to infect the primary human breast cancer cells to obtain the cells stably overexpressing miR-7. BCSCs xenograft model was established in NOD/SCID mice and the tumor tissues were analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). We found that miR-7 agomir can inhibit the tumor growth in mice and the expression of CD44 in the tumor tissues treated with miR-7 agomir was 2.4 times lower than that of control treatment from the protein array results. Among the MDA-MB- 231, MCF-7, SK-BR-3 and LD human breast cancer cell lines, the expression of CD44 was downregulated in the MCF-7 cells with relatively high miR-7 expression. Overexpression of miR-7 effectively reduced the CD44 expression in LD cells. Furthermore, compared with control and chemotherapy treatments, the mouse tumor growth was significantly inhibited in the mice infected with Lenti-miR-7-BCSCs, concomitantly decreasing the CD44 expression in tumor tissues. These findings suggest that miR-7 agomir can be used as a potential bioactive material to inhibit tumor growth in BCSCs xenograft mouse model by downregulating the CD44 expression and reducing BCSCs tumorigenicity."
169,Study of zinc oxide nanoparticles on epithelial-mesenchymal transition and toxicity of spontaneous monocyte-mediated cytotoxity-7721 cells,2021-06-01,"To explore the method of studying zinc oxide nanoparticles on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and toxicity of liver cancer SMMC-7721 cells. Human liver cancer SMMC-7721 cells is stored in 90% FBS+10% DMSO liquid nitrogen. ZnO suspension was prepared, cell viability was assessed using MTT assay, cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry, and EMT-related proteins were detected by western blotting. Results showed LDH activity increased continuously with the increase in ZnO nanoparticle concentration and exposure time (P < 0.001). Both ATP and SOD activities gradually decreased with the increase in ZnO nanoparticle concentration and exposure time (both P < 0.001). The MTT assay revealed that with the increase in ZnO dose, the proliferation of SMMC-7721 liver cancer cells decreased gradually (P < 0.001), and with the continuous increase in exposure time to ZnO nanoparticles, the reproductive viability of these cells also continued to decline (P < 0.001). The apoptosis rate of SMMC-7721 liver cancer cells increased with the increase in ZnO dose (P < 0.001). Flow cytometry results demonstrated that the apoptosis rate of SMMC-7721 liver cancer cells increased with the continuous prolongation of treatment time (P < 0.001). Western blotting experiments revealed that the concentrations of vimentin, Snail, N-cadherin, and Slugn proteins in SMMC-7721 cells increased significantly, whereas those of E-cadherin and ZO-1 decreased significantly, with the increase in ZnO dose (both P < 0.001). Therefore, ZnO nanoparticles can induce apoptosis of SMMC-7721 liver cancer cells, inhibit cell proliferation and EMT, and can be used as a new nanoparticle carrier for potential treatment of liver cancer."

172,Optimization of protocols for generation of insulin-producing cells from human embryonic stem cells using small molecules,2021-06-01,"The differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into β-cells has potential uses for cell therapy in diabetes. There were massive reported protocols which can be used to generate insulin-producing cells (IPCs) from hESCs, and most of these methods were using recombinant growth factors. However, small molecules can coax ES cells towards pancreatic fate, and could substitute recombinant proteins. To obtain an unbiased characterization, we performed a comparative study with the recombinant protein induction protocol and the small molecule induction protocol and found that the small molecule induction protocol could better inhibit the differentiation of cells into hepatic lineage cells than the recombinant protein induction protocol. On this basis, we further optimized and established an efficient small molecule differentiation system, and the optimized protocol could better inhibit the differentiation of pancreatic exocrine glands. The differentiated hESCs obtained by our optimized protocol comprised approximately 32% IPCs as assayed by flow cytometry analysis. Transmission electron micrograph demonstrated that IPCs obtained in optimized small molecule induction protocol had more and larger secretory granules than those in induction protocol before optimization."
173,Basic regulatory effects and clinical value of metalloproteinase-14 and extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer in diabetic retinopathy,2021-06-01,"This study examined the basic regulatory effects and clinical value of metalloproteinase-14 and extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer in diabetic retinopathy. Seventy-four patients with diabetic retinopathy (study group/diabetic retinopathy (DR) group) and 48 healthy people (control group) were included in this study. Venous blood of subjects in the two groups was collected and the plasma levels of EMMPRIN, MMP-14, VEGF, and MMP-9 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The value of applying plasma EMMPRIN and MMP-14 for predicting the prognosis of DR was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with a 1-year follow-up. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured in high-glucose conditions. EMMPRIN and MMP-14 mRNA levels were determined by RT-qPCR, EMMPRIN and MMP-14 protein levels were determined by Western blotting, apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry, and the level of angiogenesis was recorded. The levels of EMMPRIN and MMP-14 in the DR group were increased compared with those in the control group. Plasma EMMPRIN was positively correlated with plasma MMP-9 and plasma VEGF, and its area under the curve (AUC) for predicting 1-year adverse outcome of DR was 0.676. Plasma MMP-14 was also positively correlated with plasma MMP-9 and plasma VEGF, and its AUC for predicting 1-year adverse outcome of DR was 0.650. EMMPRIN and MMP-14 were upregulated in high-glucose-induced HUVECs. Downregulation of EMMPRIN resulted in downregulation of MMP-14, and downregulation of MMP-14 and EMMPRIN resulted in decreased apoptosis and angiogenesis of HUVECs. These findings suggest that EMMPRIN promotes endothelial cell apoptosis and angiogenesis in DR through MMP-14, and that plasma EMMPRIN and MMP-14 can help predict the short-term prognosis of DR."

The purpose of this work is to expand the application of agarose. In this work, agarose microparticles for encapsulating microorganisms were introduced to the stomach through a novel water-in-water (w/w) emulsification method. Sequencing techniques were performed for the identification and characterization of bacteria, and drug-susceptibility testing of Helicobacter pylori through gel microdroplets growth assay and traditional Oxford cup method was conducted. Results indicated the presence of three phyla, eight genera, and more than 30 species in the samples. The correlation values of the traditional Oxford cup and GMD methods were 87.5% and 90%, respectively. The proposed encapsulation technology as efficient substitution for traditional Oxford cup method promised to be applicable for the isolation and cultivation of gastric flora. Compared to other methods, this new method showed advantages when mainly due to time simplicity of the whole process. The direct drug susceptibility test based on the novel encapsulation technology is a promising tool for the rational and flexible use of drugs in clinical practice.

Therefore, it is a need to develop new and effective antimicrobial agents to overcome this problem. In this paper, new Dioxovanadium(V) complexes (1–8) with ligands viz. (2-(5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-yl)phenol; L1) and 2,5-bis(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (L2) were synthesized and assessed for antimicrobial-activity. Both a bidentate and tetradentate oxadiazole ligands coordinate with vanadium ions through the nitrogen and oxygen atoms giving octahedral geometries. Thermal analysis and IR data confirmed the presence of hydrated water in the metal-complexes. The investigated compounds were assessed for antimicrobial viz four strains of bacterial and one a fungal strain. The antibacterial data showed that, the complexes (1–8) are lower potency against bacterial strain than the free ligands except (5) and (7) complexes. These complexness showed the highest antibacterial potency via the Staphylococcus aureus. All investigated compounds were inactive against C. albicans except complexes 2 and 5 which showed high activity. The performance of DFT was conducted to examine an interaction mode of the target compounds with biological system. The QSPR was calculated as: optimization geometries, (FMOs), and chemical-reactivities for the synthesized compounds. The (MEPs) were figured to predict the interaction behavior of the ligand and its complexes against the receptor. The molecular docking was performed against DNA gyrase to study the interaction mode with biological system."
176,Human papillomavirus genotyping and vaginal microbial metabolites in 276 patients with atypical cervical squamous cells and the clinical effect of nano-silver after loop electrosurgical excision procedure,2021-06-01,"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is a precancerous lesion of cervical malignant tumors. CIN is closely related to persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, sexual behavior, and number of childbirths. The effect of vaginal microbial metabolites (VMM) on CIN is unclear; hence, we studied the effects of VMM and high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) infection on CIN and the clinical effects of nano-silver after loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). We selected the patients who went to the obstetrics and gynecology department of our hospital from January 2019 to November 2020, and we conducted vaginal microbiology, HPV typing, and histopathological examination on 282 patients. Among them, six patients had cervical cancer, 136 patients with CIN were regarded as the CIN group, and 140 patients with normal pathological tissue were regarded as the normal group. The results showed that H2O2 and HR-HPV infection were significantly correlated with the risk of CIN (P < 0.05). LEEP was performed on CIN patients, and the treatment with nano-silver gynecological antibacterial suppository was postoperatively compared with patients without special treatment. The results show that postoperative treatment with nano-silver can shorten the bleeding and exudation time of the wound and promote wound healing. It can simultaneously reduce wound infection and promote HPV to become negative, which can effectively reduce postoperative complications and recurrence."
177,Perioperative management of wounds with nanosilver dressing after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer,2021-06-01,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) can improve the success rate of breast cancer surgery; however, most patients have obvious negative thoughts about NAC. Failure to effectively relieve these negative emotions or thoughts will adversely affect the quality of life of the patients after treatment. Therefore, a majority of nursing staff are committed toward reducing patients’ negative emotions through good perioperative management as well as improving the treatment effects and postoperative quality of life of patients. A good perioperative management of breast cancer should include postoperative wound and patient psychological care. This study found that patients using nanosilver dressings have greatly reduced total wound drainage, drainage tube removal time, and postoperative complications within four days after surgery and that the rate of wound healing was obviously improved. This suggests that nanosilver dressings can improve the rate of wound healing and reduce the risk of complications. At the same time, we found that postoperative negative emotions of patients receiving comprehensive care were effectively relieved and their mental flexibility was also improved. In addition, the quality of sleep, quality of life, and nursing satisfaction of patients receiving comprehensive care were significantly higher than those receiving traditional care models. This shows that the comprehensive care model is capable of reducing the negative emotions of patients during the perioperative period and also helps to improve the quality of life of patients after surgery. Therefore, this study demonstrates that the use of nanosilver dressings as a comprehensive care model can reduce the risk of negative emotions and complications in addition to improving the rate of wound healing and postoperative quality of life."
178,Evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function in a non-human primate animal model with chronic exposure to methamphetamine,2021-06-01,"Psychostimulants, such as amphetamine-type stimulants, induce alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis function. In this study, we sought to investigate the changes in the HPT axis using a wellcharacterized non-human primate model after chronic exposure to methamphetamine (MA). The data collected from 10 adult monkeys were retrospectively studied, assigning them into two groups—the control group (saline) and MA group. MA was injected for 4 weeks with gradually increasing dose, and later injected maintenance doses for 24 weeks. We collected and tested the blood samples on a weekly basis for T4, free T4, T3, free T3, TSH, TgAb, and TPOAb. We used western blotting and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction techniques to test the protein and mRNA expression of bcl-2, Bax, and thyroid stimulating hormonereceptor. The MA group had significantly higher levels of T4, FT4, T3, and TSH than the control group. However, no significant difference was observed in FT3, TGAb, and TPOAb. Compared with the control group, most of the thyroid from the MA group consistently showed markedly disordered structure: varied size, lymphocytic infiltration, and local fibrosis. In the MA group, the protein and mRNA expression of Bax were significantly higher than the control group, whereas the protein and mRNA expression of Bcl-2 and TSH-R were significantly lower. These results indicate that chronic exposure to MA can lead to changes in the HPT axis function and induce apoptosis or other microdamage to the thyroid gland in a non-human primate model."
179,The value of a nano-bamboo charcoal ankle guard combined with ankle-joint rehabilitation treatment on the rehabilitation effect of ankle-joint motor injury,2021-06-01,"Ankle-joint sports injuries with poor rehabilitation results can seriously affect a patient’s quality of life. Nanobamboo charcoal has a strong adsorbability and disinfection effect. It has been used in ankle guards, but the effect of nanometer-sized bamboo charcoal has not been reported thus far. In this study, 98 patients with an ankle-joint motor injury were divided into a Regular Group and Joint Group (49 cases, each) using the random number table method. The Regular Group received the conventional treatment, and the Joint Group received nano-bamboo charcoal ankle guard combined with ankle-joint rehabilitation treatment. The analysis showed that ankle function, balance function, dorsiflexion range of motion, American Orthopedic Foot Ankle Society score, and total effective rate (91.84% vs. 73.47%) in the Joint Group were all higher than those in the Regular Group, while the Visual Analog Scale and Clinical Symptom Score scores were all lower than those of the conventional group (P < 0.05). This indicates that a nano-bamboo charcoal ankle guard combined with ankle-joint rehabilitation treatment can effectively reduce pain and improve ankle-joint balance, movement, dorsiflexion range of motion, and other functioning parameters of the patients, with a significant curative effect and high clinical application value."
180,Synthesis of Ag nanoparticle supported graphene/multi-walled carbon nanotube based nanohybrids for photodegradation of toxic dyes,2021-06-01,"Irrespective of the superior surface properties of graphene, research interests are impulsively devoted to synthesizing 1-D carbon nanomaterial-based binary or ternary nanocomposites for potential applications. Nevertheless, an insightful comparison between the properties of graphene oxide (GO) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is lacking in the literature. In the present work, quasi-spherical silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were anchored on two different carbon nanomaterial/Ag-based photocatalysts, GO/Ag and multiwalled CNT (MWCNT)/Ag via a modified one-pot synthesis approach. The synthesized Ag NPs and photocatalysts were analyzed using XRD, FTIR, FESEM, TEM, and UV-Vis spectroscopy and tested for their photocatalytic efficiency against three different toxic organic dyes, namely rose bengal (RB), methylene blue (MB), and phenol red (PR). During the photocatalytic process, the reactive oxygen species generated via interband transitions from the surface plasmonic resonance of Ag NPs acted synergistically with unique electrostatic interactions by carbon nanomaterials in the GO/Ag-based catalyst to degrade RB, MB, and PR dyes by 92, 87.6, and 81.4%, respectively within 120 min of UV irradiation. Furthermore, temperature dependence and electricity cost consumption were evaluated to establish the specific advantages of GO over its carbon-based counterparts for the purification of wastewater."
181,Efficient antibacterial polyphosphazene material with potential to prominent wound healing,2021-06-01,"Reducing the toxicity of silver-based antibacterial agents used in gels and improving their biocompatibility are of great significance in the development of wound dressings. Thus, a highly crosslinked organic–inorganic hybrid porous polyphosphazene nanospheres (PRV-HMSs) were prepared via precipitation polymerization. The structures and properties were investigated. The results indicated that PRV-HMSs have uniform particle size about 500 nm, excellent thermal stability, high silver loading (26.5 wt.%) and remarkable sustained-release properties after loading AgNO3 (up to 2 weeks). The antibacterial effects were investigated with zone of inhibition testing, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), Live/Dead bacterial staining assay and bacterial growth curve assays. The silver-loaded nanospheres have excellent bactericidal effects for E. coli or S. aureus and an average bactericidal rate of 94.02% and 94.67% in the 120 hour long-acting antibacterial test. The cytotoxicity and laser confocal immunofluorescence staining experiments indicate that the simple combination of nanospheres and agar not only give low cytotoxicity, but also significantly promote the activation of macrophages, which showing potential application in the wound dressings based on hydrogel."

The effects of sintering duration, chemical composition and temperature on the structure and electrochemical performance were studied. The results show that the 0.3Li2MnO3·0.7(LiMn1/3Co1/3Ni1/3)O2 material prepared at 800 °C for 20 h has higher crystallization degree and better electrochemical performance. The charge capacity in the first circle was 359.8 mAh·g-1, the discharge capacity was 240.3 mAh·g-1, the discharge efficiency was 66.8% and the capacity retention was also 97.6% after 20 cycles."

184,Thermal performance of silica aerogel-filled double-layer glazing in a subtropical climate,2021-06-01,"Heat gain through glazing is a major source of the space cooling load in subtropical cooling-dominant climates. Application of energy-efficient glazing systems can significantly reduce the energy consumption of air conditioning in summer. Thus, it has become a popular research topic. In this study, a sample of silica aerogel glazing was developed and prepared. Two identical insulated boxes were then constructed; one faÇade was equipped with the aerogel glazing sample and the other was prepared with a conventional double-layer glazing. An onsite measurement of the boxes’ internal thermal properties was then conducted. The two boxes were placed within the same outdoor environment. The temperature, humidity, and enthalpy values were calculated with the boxes facing different orientations and in a variety of weather conditions. The performance of the silica aerogel glazing was then evaluated by both experimental and theoretical analysis. The results of this study will provide a basis for aerogel glass building application guidelines."
185,Study on compressive properties and chloride permeability of ultra-high-performance concrete,2021-06-01,"In this work, two UHPC premixes were applied in investigating compressive strength and chloride permeability. Results indicated that the compressive strength of UHPC increased with content of steel fiber in standard curing. Compressive strength of type-A premix specimen with 2.0 vol% steel fiber was more than 150 MPa after heat curing. All UHPC in the experiment showed low chloride permeability under heat curing. Compared with type-B premix, the type-A premix had greater advantages in mechanical property and chloride permeability. In addition, the low porosity and dense microstructure of UHPC specimen were detected by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and scanning electron microscope (SEM), respectively. Furthermore, it was found that the introduction of fiber could refine the pore size distribution of specimen."
186,Morphometric changes in the rat retina following carbomer induced elevations in intraocular pressure,2021-06-01,"An elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) model was established in rats by injecting a carbomer suspension loaded on a nanomaterial vector into the anterior chamber. Characteristics of elevated IOP caused by carbomer were assessed by examining effects on hypertension, and for the anterior segment and retinal morphometric changes. Baseline IOP was measured in twenty-four Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were selected and was measured twice for three days preoperatively. After treatment, we found a significant difference between day and night in experimental eyes and between day and night in control eyes (all P <0.05). Later post-injection, fluctuations in IOP decreased significantly. We found a large difference in mean IOP between experimental and control eyes during the day (P <0.05). The anterior chamber of experimental eyes was filled with a mixture of carbomer and iris, which was close to the corneal endothelium, extended to the anterior chamber angle, and blocked the trabecular meshwork structure. After four weeks, pressure-induced morphological damage of retina was observed by H&E staining and ERG. Apoptosis was detected in the retinal ganglion cell layer by TUNEL staining. Carbomer induced increased IOP was maintained for more than four weeks. Elevated IOP was significantly different between day and night, with night pressure higher."
187,Lipase-catalyzed selective esterification of catechin,2021-06-01,"Catechins show strong antioxidant, antitumoral, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory activities. The uses of catechins in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical formulations seem very attractive. Unfortunately, solubility and stability of catechins are poor in apolar media, which limits their efficient uses. In order to improve the solubility of catechins in the oil phase and maintain their oxidation resistance, a regioselective enzymatic acylation was investigated. The effects of reaction medium, water content, carbon chain length of acyl donor and other factors on the acylation reaction were studied, catechins were enzymatically esterified with an aliphatic acid (stearic acid) using an immobilized lipase Novozym 435 in n-butanol. The results show that when the ratio between catechins and stearic acid was 1:5, adding molecular sieves 4A after 11 h of reaction and the temperature of 60 °C led to the maximum conversion yield of 60.36%. Studies have shown that catechin stearate has a higher antioxidant activity than vitamin E and dibutyl hydroxytoluene (BHT)."
188,Synthesis of Ag–Cu alloy nanosheets for ascorbic acid detection,2021-06-01,"Metal alloy nanosheets play a very important role as catalysts, which also show obvious advantages in the field of biosensor. Compared with traditional methods, such as enzyme method, gas chromatography or optical absorbance, the detection of ascorbic acid is simpler and more stable by spectroscopy. Ag–Cu alloy nanosheets with a thickness of about 1–3 nm and an average lateral size of 3–5 nm were synthesized in this study by the soft template method. These nanosheets were used to construct a sensor for measuring the concentration of ascorbic acid. The initial UV-Vis absorption peaks for the Ag–Cu alloy nanosheets in aqueous solution were effectively quenched upon addition of ascorbic acid. As the ascorbic acid concentration was in the range of 5–250 mmol/L changes, the UV absorbance intensity for the sensor also changed. Because of its wide detection range, high sensitivity, and excellent stability, the Ag–Cu alloy sensor method may be an excellent alternative to the traditional ascorbic acid measure method."
189,Numerical simulation and application of micro-nano bubble releaser for irrigation,2021-06-01,"In oxygenated irrigation, there are problems of large oxygenated bubble particles, low oxygen concentration in water, and mismatch with current irrigation systems. In this paper, numerical simulation of micro-nano bubble releaser was carried out and the development of oxygenated irrigation equipment was studied. The release method of dissolved gas was selected to generate micro-nano bubbles after comparing different micro-nano bubble generation methods. The basic structure of the core-component releaser of generating micro-nano bubbles was initially determined. Effects of different structures of the release device on water aeration performance were studied by CFD analysis method. An optimal structure of the releaser was determined with orthogonal experiments based on a single factor experiment. The structural parameters included a throat of a 3 mm diameter, a 2 mm thick turbulent cavity, a six-degree exit angle, and two outlets. Optimal inlet and outlet pressure difference of the release device was 0.3 MPa. The bubble had an average particle size of 373.1 nm as measured. The release device was fabricated by 3D printing technology and the micro-nano bubble aeration irrigation device was developed. The system function test was carried out. Under the standard state, the performance parameters of the micro-nano bubble aerator included the maximum oxygen concentration of 11.4 mg/L, a total oxygen transfer coefficient of 0.4139 min-1, 0.0114 kg/h oxygenation capacity, and 60.81% oxygen utilization rate. The device had advantages of a high oxygen-increasing efficiency and a small volume, making it quite prospective in the field of oxygenated irrigation."
190,Preparation and evaluation of -loaded cationic liposome for anti-asthma treatment,2021-05-01,"Asthma is considered as a difficult chronic disease with prolonged inflammation, reversible obstruction and remodeling in the airway. The present work aimed to examine the therapeutic efficacy of Bergenin-loaded Cationic Liposome (B-CLs) in asthma. We applied the thin film dispersion approach to prepare B-CLs, which were administered orally to asthma mice. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), cytokine contents and histopathological results were obtained and examined by transmission electron microscope (TEM), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits, together with histopathological study separately. B-CLs had a mean size of 158.33 ± 5.88 nm with positive potential of 24.51 ± 0.51 mV. In pharmacokinetics, the area under curve (AUC0–∞) and half-life (T1/2) of B-CLs were 3.33 and 3.92 times higher than free Bergenin. Compared with model group, alveolus and airway wall lesions in hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining of B-CLs-Medium/High dose groups declined as the wall-infiltrating inflammatory cell number declined. The thicknesses of airway wall and bronchial smooth muscle, together with the counts of bronchial smooth nuclei in B-CLs decreased significantly (P < 0.01). Specially, the ultrastructural airway changes were markedly-reversed in the B-CLs-High (P < 0.01). The changes of cytokines indicated the decrease in inflammation and improvement of the balance between T helper 1 cytokines (Th1) and T helper 2 cytokines (Th2). B-CLs could significantly enhance the dissolution, bioavailability and more inhibit airway inflammation as well as improve the lung histopathological condition."
191,AMD3100-tagged nano-gold as a targeting nanocarrier for delivery of doxorubicin into lung cancer cells,2021-05-01,"Doxorubicin (DOX) is widely used as a traditional chemotherapy drug in tumor treatment, but its dose-dependent side effects make it susceptible to acquired resistance. CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor that has high expression in many cancers, including lung cancer. In this work, we studied the possibility of using CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100, as a targeting molecule to targeted delivery of DOX to CXCR4 expressing lung cancer cells through conjugated gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). DOX was intercalated inside the pH-responsive doublestrand DNA (dsDNA) and then conveniently loaded onto the Au NPs. The CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100, was bonded with LA-PEG, and then conjugated to the surface of Au-S bond. The doxorubicin release from [email protected]@AMD3100 NPs was in a pH-dependent model, and specificity of [email protected]@AMD3100 nanoparticle was verified by using free DOX and [email protected] NPs as control. Results in this work not only confirmed the possibility of using AMD3100 as a targeting ligand for tumor-targeted treatment, but also suggested that the non-toxic Au NPs is a prospect nanocarrier for target design of cancer therapy."
192,Polylactic acid block copolymer grafted temozolomide targeted nano delivery in the treatment of glioma,2021-05-01,"Gliomas are tumors of the central nervous system; they can be invasive and are commonly treated by surgical resection, chemo, and radiotherapy. Removal of a glioma is dangerous and not always successful. Temozolomide (TMZ), the first-line chemotherapy drug for gliomas, inhibit tumor recurrence, and metastasis to some extent. TMZ is often accompanied by side effects such as anemia, fever, constipation, and more. Here using a double-targeted Kunitz domain Angiopep-2 (ANG) modified block copolymer poly(lactic acid)-polyethylene glycol (PEG-PLA) coated with TMZ, we constructed a nano-delivery system ([email protected]/TMZ) that crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to treat gliomas."
193,Heparanase-induced proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis are associated with the phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10/focal adhesion kinase signaling pathway in multiple myeloma,2021-05-01,"Heparanase (HPSE) has an important effect on the proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance of tumor cells. HPSE can promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of various solid tumor cells. Previous studies regarding the function of HPSE in multiple myeloma (MM) have primarily focused on tumor invasion and metastasis, whereas few studies have examined the proliferation and apoptosis of MM and the mechanisms associated with HPSE. This study recruited patients with MM and isolated MM cells (RPMI8226, LP-1) were isolated to measure the expression levels of HPSE, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) proteins to elucidate their roles in tumor formation. Compared with non-tumor patients, the mRNA and protein expression levels of HPSE and FAK in MM patients increased, whereas the levels of PTEN mRNA and protein decreased. Thus, the increase of HPSE coincided with an increase of FAK and a decrease of PTEN. MM cells exhibiting high HPSE expression exhibited increased proliferation and decreased AS2O3-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that changes in HPSE expression affect the proliferation and apoptosis of MM cells and this mechanism may be associated with the PTEN/FAK signaling pathway. Gene transfection needs proper vector, and proper gene transport system can improve transfection efficiency. In this paper, magnetic nanoparticles were transfected with overexpressed HPSE, and to detect the transfection efficiency and the proliferation ability of MM cells in the control group. The results showed that the cells transfected with magnetic nanoparticles had higher transfection efficiency and higher gene expression level. The results of this experiment provide a new way to explore new cancer therapy genes."
194,A comparative study of left ventricular function during pregnancy without and with gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus,2021-05-01,"The use of nanoscale ultrasonic contrast agent greatly improved the reliability of ultrasonic technology detection, and it became an effective tool to detect a series of diseases. Gestational hypertension and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) are unique and common complications during pregnancy, and they seriously affect women’s postnatal health. In this study, we evaluated the practical value of echocardiogram in evaluating Left Ventricular (LV) morphology and function changes during pregnancy with gestational hypertension and GDM. 46 pregnant women with gestational hypertension and GDM as disease group and 50 healthy pregnant women as normal group were included in the study. By echocardiogram analysis, the morphology, systole and diastole functions of LV were compared in both groups. With LV morphology change during pregnancy, LA volume (P = 0.011) of disease group was bigger than that of normal group and LV mass (P < 0.0001) and LVMi (P < 0.0001) of disease group were higher than that of normal group. However, the LVPWd (P < 0.0001) and IVSd (P < 0.0001) of disease group thickened clearly relative to that of the normal group. However, these values, including LVIDd (P = 0.185), EF value (P = 0.779), FS value (P = 0.740) and Cardiac Index (P = 0.444) for their cardiac LV systolic functions of two groups, had very few large-scale differences. Compared to normal pregnant cardiac, the E value (P = 0.014) was lower and the A value (P < 0.0001) was higher in the disease group. Moreover, E/A ratio (P < 0.0001) was obviously less than that in the experimental. According to TDI measures for both groups, the E’ value (P < 0.0001) and ratio of E/A’ (P < 0.0001) were lower and A’ value (P = 0.003) was slightly higher in the disease group compared with normal group. In recent years, we found that the E/E’ value (P = 0.0002) in the disease group was also higher. In summary, LV diastolic function during pregnancy with complications changes pregnant LV morphology and function. Echocardiogram can be used for testing and monitoring these changes as one of simple and reliable inspection methods."

The preparation process of gallic acid-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin inclusion compound was stable and feasible, and there was a good inclusion effect. After the inclusion, the solubility of gallic acid increased significantly; the prepared inclusion compound could inhibit the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli by destroying the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane, which could provide data support for the application and development of gallic acid."
196,Magnesium alloy stents: A friend or foe of coronary in-stent restenosis?,2021-05-01,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is regarded as the principal cause of cardiovascular diseases and one of the leading causes of mortality. In order to alleviate the risk of CAD, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and stent implantation have recently been applied. In particular, Mg alloy (Mg-alloy) stents (MAS) have been used as clinical routine for the treatment of CAD. However, emerging evidence suggests that this treatment strategy is substantially associated with coronary in-stent restenosis (ISR), which remains the main cause of unintentional and repeat drug-eluting stent (DES) interventions in the United States. In this regard, understanding of MAS as friend or foe of ISR treatment is needed to establish the exact mechanism underlying this condition. This mini review therefore aimed to provide an integrated view on the existing findings of the relationship between MAS and ISR. The understanding of MAS as either a friend or foe is crucial for the management of ISR, which is reported to be very challenging amidst lack of effective therapeutic options."

The fluorescence was gradually recovered via adding of Mercury ion (Hg2+) accompanied color change from yellow to colorless since the existing high binding constants and complexation ratio between Hg2+and I- . The presence of background metal cations which has weak interference for Hg2+ optical response. The experimental results reveal that polymers were kind of Hg2+ turn-on optical probe with high sensitivity and anti-interference."
198,Boosting D-carbamoylase activity of recombinant  by adjusting gene dosage and central carbon metabolism,2021-05-01,"D-p-hydroxyphenylglycine (D-HPG) as an intermediate of semisynthetic antibiotics has an important value in the pharmaceutical industry. The high pollution and high costs of chemical synthesis make D-HPG production by biocatalysis more promising. The hydantoinase method requires D-hydantoinase and D-carbamoylase (DCase) to convert D,L-p-hydroxyphenylhydantoin (D,L-HPH) into D-HPG. The recombinant Bacillus subtilis used for the whole-cell catalysis in this process needs to improve the activity and stability of DCase. The gene dosage and cell metabolism of DCase affect its activity, and this study intends to reduce the acidification effect caused by carbon catabolite repression at the genetic level. Among strains with different gene dosages, the double-copy integrated strain DN02 had the highest DCase average activity of 132 U/g dry cell weight (gDCW). When glucose was used as the carbon source, weakening glucose absorption can significantly alleviate the acidification of fermentation broth. The glcT mutant reduced the average glucose absorption rate by about 57%, whereas the DCase activity increased to about 518 U/gDCW. In addition, modifying the CcpA-binding site in citZ and the CodY-binding site in citB to increase their expression levels can also relieve the acidification of fermentation broth, which reduced the accumulation of acetate by 24% and 17%, respectively. The DCase activity of derivative strains DN16 and DN17 can reach about 615 and 641 U/gDCW. Comparing the catalytic activity of strains to dual-enzyme activities to produce D-HPG, the average whole-cell activity of strain DN17/pUBS was about fivefold higher than that of DN02/pUBS. These strategies might also be useful for other recombinant strains to express heterologous enzymes. Isolation of nucleic acids from various cells is a step of PCR. In this study, magnetic nanoparticles can be used to extract genomic DNA and total RNA due to their paramagnetism and biocompatibility. The amount and accuracy of DNA and total RNA extracted were verified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The method has the advantages of removing dangerous reagents such as phenol and chloroform, replacing inorganic coating such as silica with organic oil, and shortening reaction time."
199,Improved Hg photocatalytic reduction over g-CN nanosheets decorated with mesoporous MnO nanoparticles,2021-05-01,"The purpose of this investigation was to construct amended mesoporous Mn3O4/g-C3 N4 photocatalysts of various loadings of mesoporous Mn3O4 nanoparticles (1,2,3 and 4 wt%) for reinforced remediation of mercury ions (Hg2+) under visible light illumination. It was performed via decorating g-C3N4 nanosheets with finite portions of the prepared mesoporous Mn3O4 NPs by employing hard and soft templates. The optimized 3 wt% Mn3O4/g-C3N4 heterojunction gained confined bandgap (2.24 eV) as well as great surface area (140 m2 g -1) that support the application of such heterojunction for efficacious removal of Hg2+ under visible light. Morphological examination elucidated that the dispersed Mn3O4 NPs over g-C3N4 nanosheets were of spherical shape with particle dimension of 10-15 nm. Hg2+ was removed significantly over the formed Mn3O4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites when related to the pure materials (Mn3O4 NPs and g-C3N4). It was confirmed that Mn3O4 content, incorporated to g-C3N4 nanosheets, largely influenced the efficiency corresponding to the Hg2+ photoreduction such that appropriating 3 wt% Mn3O4 was capable of accomplishing complete removal of Hg2+ whereas, pure g-C3N 4was able to accomplish the same process by the efficiency of 15% after illumination for 60 min. Similarly, fast rate of Hg2+ photoreduction was accessed when 3% Mn3O4/g-C3N4 nanocomposite (485 µmol g–1 h–1) was administered while the photoreduction reaction was very slow with smaller rate magnitudes when pure g-C3N 4(82 µmol g -1 h -1) or pure Mn3O4 NPs (120 µmol g -1 h -1) were adopted. The powerful Hg2+ removal over the established heterojunctions can basically be associated with the larger attained surface area as well as the declined bandgap. Besides, the great dispersion of the small-sized Mn3O4 NPs and the mesoporous structure of the formed heterojunctions participated significantly in efficient Hg2+ removal. The improved characteristics of the prepared heterojunctions led to strong absorption of visible light and fast transference of reactant species, leading to enhanced photocatalytic efficiency. Recyclability experiments demonstrated that neither the photocatalytic performance nor the structure of the mesoporous Mn3O4/g-C3N4 heterojunction was altered after being reused for Hg2+ removal from aqueous solutions."
200,Overweight/obesity in students associated with short sleep duration which can be improved by nanocapsules,2021-05-01,"This study was designed to investigate the prevalence of short sleep duration in adolescents from middle school in Fuzhou, China and explore the association between short sleep duration and overweight/obesity. Nano-encapsulated vitamin D3 can improve sleep deprivation, thus reducing the prevalence of overweight and obesity. A total of 13063 students (male: 6,500; female: 6,553) from 18 schools were investigated in the study. Questionnaires focusing on short sleep duration and overweight or obesity related factors were collected. The subjects reported their own sleep duration. The body weight and height of each subject were measured by the qualified personnel. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the effects of short sleep duration on overweight/obesity in school students. The rates of overweight and obesity were 12.1% and 7.1%, respectively. The prevalence of short sleep duration among teenagers was 82.8%. The majority of high school students (92.5%) suffered from short sleep duration. Compared with male children with a sleep duration of 8-10 h per day, the odds ratios (95% Cl) of overweight/obesity for those with a sleep duration of less than 6 h or 6-8 h, were 1.63 (1.25-2.13) and 1.06 (0.88-1.27), respectively, after adjusting social and demographic status, mental health and lifestyle factors, while for female children, the odds ratios were 1.38 (0.99-1.93) and 1.04 (0.79-1.35), respectively. A large number of adolescents suffered from short sleep duration. Short sleep duration is associated with higher odds of overweight/obesity in male children."
201,"FeYO@rGO nanocomposites: Synthesis, characterization and application in photooxidative degradation of atrazine under visible light",2021-05-01,"Different organic pollutants have been remediated photo catalytically by applying perovskite photocatalysts. Atrazine (ATR) is a pesticide commonly detected as a pollutant in drinking, surface and ground water. Herein, FeYO3@rGO heterojunction was synthesized and applied for photooxidation decomposition of ATR. First, FeYO 3nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared via routine sol-gel. After that, FeYO3 NPs were successfully incorporated with different percentages (5, 10, 15 and 20 wt.%) of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in the synthesis of novel FeYO3@rGO photocatalyst. Morphological, structural, surface, optoelectrical and optical characteristics of constructed materials were identified via X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), adsorption/desorption isotherms, diffusive reflectance (DR) spectra, and photoluminescence response (PL). Furthermore, photocatalytic achievement of the constructed materials was evaluated via photooxidative degradation of ATR. Various investigations affirmed the usefulness of rGO incorporation on the advancement of formed photocatalysts. Actually, novel nanocomposite containing rGO (15 wt.%) possessed diminished bandgap energy, as well as magnified visible light absorption. Furthermore, such nanocomposite presented exceptional photocatalytic achievement when exposed to visible light as ATR was perfectly photooxidized over finite amount (1.6 g · L-1) from the optimized photocatalyst when illuminated for 30 min. The advanced photocatalytic performance of constructed heterojunctions could be accredited mainly to depressed recombination amid induced charges. The constructed FeYO3@rGO nanocomposite is labelled as efficient photocatalyst for remediation of herbicides from aquatic environments."
202,Effects of helium implantation fluence on the crystal-ion-slicing fabrication of Y-cut lithium niobate film,2021-05-01,"In the present work, the contribution of Helium implantation fluence on the Crystal-Ion-Slicing fabrication (CIS) of Y-cut LiNbO3 film were systematically investigated. Y-cut Lithium niobate (LN) thin films with a submicron thickness on the Y-cut LN substrates were successfully fabricated by CIS technique by employing He implantation. By varying the implantation fluence, the structure evolution of the LN exfoliation layer was systematically investigated by Rutherford backscattering/channeling (RBS/C), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, as well as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Upon gradually increasing the implantation fluence from 1.0 x 1016 to 4.0 x 1016 cm-2, the lattice damage together with the tensile strain in the as-implanted LN becomes intensive according to the Raman spectroscopy investigations. In addition to the crystalline quality, the root mean square roughness becomes 1.4 nm upon increasing fluence till 4.0 x 1016 cm-2. The blistering threshold fluence for Y-cut LN is found to be between 1.0 x 1016 and 2.0 x 1016 cm-2, and the Arrhenius plot of the blistering time as a function of reciprocal temperature shows that the activation of blistering is 2.14 eV, 1.77 eV and 1.44 eV for samples under fluence of 2.0 x 1016, 3.0x 1016 and 4.0 x 1016 cm-2, respectively. Our experimental results unambiguously contribute to exploring the avenue of achieving high-quality layer, particularly highly anisotropic ones, by CIS techniques."
203,Deterioration of concrete containing limestone powder exposed to sulfate attack at ambient temperature,2021-05-01,"This study investigates the deterioration of concrete containing limestone powder exposed to sulfate solution under ambient temperature (20~25 °C). Microstructure and mineral phases within the attacked concrete were measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was found that the addition of limestone powder increased the initial porosity of concrete. Consequently, a larger amount of SO2– 4 ions diffused into the concrete containing limestone powder, and their degree of deterioration caused by sulfate attack increased with the increase in limestone powder content. At ambient temperature, gypsum and ettringite were the major attack products, respectively within the surface and nearsurface portions of concrete containing limestone powder, which was consistent with the products of sulfate attack within concrete without limestone powder. Therefore, the type and distribution of the attack products in concrete had not been revised due to the addition of limestone powder. Nevertheless, the adverse influence of limestone powder on the sulfate resistance of concrete, even at ambient temperature, should be considered. Furthermore, effective measures should be implemented to improve the durability of concrete containing limestone powder in this environment."
204,"Macromechanics, microstructure and particle contact model of artificially cemented laterite",2021-05-01,"In this paper, the research is based on iron hydroxide colloids that combine loose kaolin clay media to form artificial laterite samples. A method and device for the preparation of colloids have been developed. The compressive strength test method is used to explore the regularity and mechanism of free iron oxides which in the process of the formation and strength increase of laterite structure. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were used to study the mineral composition of the laterite, the cementation of microscopic aggregates of the particles, and the changes in the internal porosity of the laterite. The results show that the free iron oxide can improve the macro-mechanical properties of laterite. The iron morphology has a tendency to change from colloid to hematite and goethite. It is found that the free iron oxide aggregated in the space or on the surface of clay particles. Distribution; gel particles were found to fill the pores of laterite particles or aggregates by nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, indicating that the changes in the mechanical strength of laterite are mainly due to the content of free iron oxide, the formation of free iron oxide, the connection of cementing iron and the distribution of iron. Based on the SEM results, a contact model of laterite particles that can reflect the macro-mechanical failure behavior of soil samples is established."
205,Multi-scale characterization of the effect of saturated steam on the macroscale properties and surface changes of moso bamboo,2021-05-01,"Bamboo is a woody material that has become a key substitute for wood resources in many fields. This study is aimed to analyze the effects of saturated steam (140, 160, 180 °C) on physical, crystallinity, chemical composition, mechanical properties as well as microstructures at different periods (4, 6, 8, 10 min). Expectedly, a reduction of hemicellulose and cellulose and increment of relative content of lignin in bamboo when temperature above 160 °C was positive to reduce the equilibrium moisture content (EMC). Thus, the hygroscopicity improved and the parenchyma cells and vascular bundles were shrunk slightly. Both temperature and time positively affected the crystallinity of bamboo samples in comparison with the control. Heat treatment parameters affect the mechanical properties of bamboo. When the treatment was carried out at 140 °C, the modulus of rupture (MOR) and modulus of elastic (MOE) increased in comparison to no treatment; Furthermore, The MOR and MOE decreased by 40% and 19% compared with that of the untreated bamboo at 180 °C for 10 min. The temperature and time had a great influence on a*, b*, and L* of the bamboo. The results showed that during the heat treatment, the bamboo color changed from light yellow to dark red-brown, and the overall color changed evenly. Among them, a* increased firstly and then decreased, indicating that the treated bamboo was reddish, while b* and L* mainly showed a downward trend. The ΔE value positively corresponded to heat treatment severity."
206,A facial  approach to synthesize Ti2NbO@PANI core-shell microspheres for high performance lithium ion battery anodes,2021-05-01,"Polyaniline (PANI) wrapped Ti2Nb10O29 (TNO) micro-spherical composites were successfully synthesized via a solvothermal approach combined with a facial post in-situ polymerization method. Effects of different amounts of the PANI coatings on the composite microspheres’ electrochemical properties were studied in detail. Results showed that the electrochemical performance of [email protected] anodes with 5 wt% PANI is the optimum among all the samples, giving capacity values as high as 272 mAh/g (1 C) and 190.1 mAh/g (20 C), respectively. Moreover, the electrochemical impedance measurements exhibited that 5 wt% [email protected] composite electrode material possess a weaker charge transfer resistance. This indicates that an appropriate amount of polyaniline coating can effectively improve the electronic conductivity of TNO microspheres and subsequently the electrochemical properties. In this work, we have demonstrated that 3D [email protected] composite microspheres not only deliver a higher initial Columbic efficiency but also can serve as next-generation lithium-ion battery electrode material with enhanced rate performance."
207,Research on the electrical contact degradation model of plug-in connectors under corrosion and wear,2021-05-01,"Failures due to corrosion are common for connectors operating under atmospheric environment. Results of previous studies lacked universal applicability and neglected the degradation process of contact resistance. Also, wear is rarely considered in studies on corrosion degradation, which is an inevitable mechanical process for plug connectors. Considering these problems, the atmospheric corrosion process and copper dynamics were analyzed. The consistency of the atmospheric corrosion mechanism was used to study the local corrosion degradation law and its influencing factors. The wear mechanism on corrosion degradation was determined through the analysis of the influencing factors. The corrosion model of the gold-plated parts under atmospheric wear was established. To study the degradation process of electrical contacts, a degradation model of contact resistance based on the multi-spot contact mechanism was established combined with the previous corrosion degradation model. Experimentally, the corrosion spot density increases as a function of time and varies with plated thickness, whereas the corrosion spot size distribution is still relatively independent of time. The skew phenomenon appears in the cumulative distribution probability of contact resistance as exposure time increases. Whereas the degradation of electrical contact resistance increases as a function of time, the median remains relatively unchanged. A brief analysis of the contact reliability under wear and corrosive environments was also carried out."
208,Effect of pre-corrosion on the fatigue fracture behavior of ER8 wheel steel,2021-05-01,"The salt spray pre-corrosion test was carried on the fatigue specimens of ER8 wheel steel, and then fatigue experiment with a stress ratio (R) of 0.1 was conducted. The fractures were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy. The results show that pre-corrosion significantly reduces the fatigue limit of the rim material, the main crack-induced fracture mechanism occurs under pre-corrosion conditions for 6 h at a lower stress, and the fracture mechanism of multi-crack interactions occurs at a higher stress after pre-corrosion for 48 h. For pre-corrosion fatigue test, cracks originate from pitting pits. Then, multiple fatigue crack nucleations expand from different orientations in the transgranular fracture mode, forming cleavage facets."

Their activity as sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor type 1 (S1P1) agonists were evaluated by [γ-35S] GTP binding assay. Among the thioether substituted compounds, compound 10 showed good activity as S1P1 agonist at low micromolar concentration (EC50 = 0.698 μmol/L). The result suggested that it has potential activity against autoimmune diseases and immunosuppressant of organ transplantations."
210,Sodium houttuyfonate relieves acute lung injury by nano micellar carrier and inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor kappa-B activation in mice,2021-05-01,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by increased pulmonary vascular permeability in response to the accumulation of inflammatory cells, release of inflammatory cytokines, and activated oxidative stress. The present study was performed to investigate the effect of sodium houttuyfonate (SH), an extract of Houttuynia cordata, on inflammatory response and oxidative stress in ALI induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly allocated to control, LPS, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and SH groups. The ALI model was established by intratracheal LPS injection. Lung tissue was collected 6 h after LPS injection for histopathological analysis, measurement of wet-to-dry ratio, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and oxidative stress levels, and the p38, jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), and p65 phosphorylation levels. Bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) was collected for the detection of protein concentration, MPO and cytokine levels. The histopathological test showed that SH significantly alleviates damage to pulmonary tissue. Improved vascular permeability was indicated by reduced BALF protein level and lung wet-to-dry ratio in the SH group. MPO levels were decreased in lung tissue and BALF. Oxidative stress and inflammatory responses were inhibited by SH, as indicated by MDA, SOD and cytokine levels. The MAPK and NF-KB pathways were inhibited as shown by the attenuated phosphorylation of p38, JNK, ERK and p65. Sodium houttuyfonate exhibited a protective role against LPS-induced lung injury through anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The MAPK and NF-K B pathways may be inhibited by sodium houttuyfonate. Sodium Houttuynin has a good effect on a variety of acute infectious diseases, but its solubility and stability are insufficient, which limits its efficacy. Nano delivery system can enhance the effective ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine, reduce the toxic and side effects of drugs, and improve their medicinal properties. Therefore, this paper adopts nano delivery system to assist drug use and improve research efficiency."
211,Silencing of cluster determinant 36 transmitted by gold nanoparticles inhibits the occurrence and progression of breast cancer by down-regulating the peroxisome proliferative activated receptor signaling pathway,2021-05-01,"Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed tumor in women worldwide. Although a range of therapeutic strategies have been developed in recent years, the outcome for patients is often poor. The purpose of this study was to explore the molecular mechanisms of the membrane glycoprotein CD36 in breast cancer. Cells from breast cancer cell lines were transfected with gold nanoparticles protected by liposomes, as gene vectors. Cell counting kit 8 assays were performed to determine cell variability, EdU straining assays were used to evaluate cell proliferation, and colony formation assays were performed to detect cell colony ability. The number of cells involved in migration and invasion was counted using Transwell assays. Lymphangiogenesis formation was assessed using lymphangiogenesis formation assay. Xenograft tumor mice were established, to analyze the effects of CD36. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blotting, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to estimate the expression of genes. Silencing of CD36 inhibited cell variability, proliferation, colony formation, lymphangiogenesis, and repressed cell migration and invasion in vitro. Overexpression of PPAR reversed the effects of the silencing of CD36, and the effects of PPAR upregulation were blocked by PPAR inhibitor. In vivo, tumor growth and lymphangiogenesis and PPAR activation were suppressed by the silencing of CD36. Silencing of CD36 also inhibited the variability, proliferation, colony formation, lymphangiogenesis, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells by suppressing PPAR signaling pathway activation. The CD36 gene was transfected with gold nanoparticles which improved the efficiency of gene transfection. The use of gold nanoparticles provides a new way to study the effects of genes on tumor cells."
212,High throughput and uniform tumour spheroids culture system for drug screening,2021-04-01,"Three dimensional (3D) cellular culture system has drawn a significant attention as a powerful tool in the fields of tissue engineering and drug testing, owing to its outstanding ability to mimic native tissue microenvironments. The development of 3D cellular models’ generation, especially for preclinical trials of drug candidates, reduces the differences between in vitro and in vivo models. However, there remains the challenge, that it’s hard to increase the generation yield and control size of 3D cellular model in drug development process. Herein, we designed a simple but useful microfluidic chip containing microwell array to culture cellular spheroids. High throughput and uniform lung cancer cells (A549) spheroids, with an average diameter of 150 µm, were obtained after culturing for 120 h and showed good cell activity. The simplicity and robustness of our culture system make it attractive as a stable and easy-to-operate device to construct the vitro tissue models in drug screening."

In this paper, we presented dietary fiber-based microcarriers capable of absorption by the colon and great biocompatibility for colon-targeting drug delivery in treating IBD. The particles were prepared by inulin, a kind of dietary fiber that was employed to regulate the intestinal microflora and improve intestinal health, through microfluidic approach. Many kinds of drugs, including budesonide, could be integrated into the particles. Besides, the microparticles would release activities with the absorption of inulin in colon site, providing the particles capability of colon-targeting drug delivery in treating IBD. It was demonstrated that the microparticles loaded with drug were able to downregulate expression of pro-inflammatory factors, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), upregulate expression of anti-inflammatory factors, interferon-α (IFN-α), IL-10, significantly repair the intestinal damage, thereby promoting the treatment of IBD. This suggests the great promising value of inulin microcarriers in IBD therapy and biomedical applications."
214,Chitosan and nafion assisted modification of enzyme-free electrochemical immunosensors for the detection of tetrodotoxin,2021-04-01,"Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is one of the most toxic nonprotein marine neurotoxins without antidotes. Two enzyme-free electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of TTX are fabricated in this work. On this immunosensor, a competitive immunoassay is established. Chitosan and Nafion are used to facilitate the TTX antigen modification, where TTX antigen is attached to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to perform good electrochemical measurement. The detection strategy involves an enzyme-free process when performing electrochemical immunoassay. The LOQ of 4 µg/kg for real samples and the linear range from 2 to 1250 ng/mL for solution test are obtained. Recovery of >78% and relative standard deviation of <6.1% for the two immunosensors are further validated by spiking experiment. Test on pufferfish samples shows consistency with the results from the HPLC-MS method. These electrochemical immunosensors have the merits of being portable, low cost, battery-powered and fast for practical application, which can be a promising alternative to ELISA for on-site detection."
215,Research on the synergistic effect of the nanoparticle combined miRNA-451 and protein on restraining the proliferation of lung cancer cells,2021-04-01,"Our study was aimed to discuss the synergistic effect of the nanoparticles combined miRNA-451 and protein on restraining the proliferation of lung cancer cells. The nanoparticles combined with paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) were prepared and characterized by means of analysis of particle size distribution by scanning electron microscope. The solution of nab-paclitaxel or expression of miRNA-451 was adopted to interfere the proliferation and apoptosis of lung cancer cell line. Cell cycle and apoptosis was studied with FCM. The proliferation of lung cancer was detected through MTT, cell clone, etc. Expression of apoptosis-related proteins was detected by Western-Blot. The average particle size of nanoparticles was about 144.13 ± 11.7 nm. There was slight transformation. The cell activity was reduced by nab-paclitaxel compared with that of the control group and cell activity was also reduced by si-miR-451. However, the effect of nab-paclitaxel and si-miR-451 with albumin on cell activity was stronger than that of the single drug. The effect on blocking cell proliferation was most obvious when A549 cell was treated with nab-paclitaxel combined with the si-miR-451. The cell apoptosis was restrained by si-miR-451 combined with nab-paclitaxel notably. The synergistic effect of the nab-paclitaxel and miRNA-451 had more obviously inhibitory effect on the proliferation of lung cancer cell."
216,Application of fibrous materials in the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis,2021-04-01,"Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is a non-suppurative inflammatory disease of meninges and meninges caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), with high mortality. Traditional methods for laboratory detection of MTB are less sensitive and time-consuming. Some fibrous materials like silica fiber in GeneXpert MTB/RIF kit and paper fiber in acid-fast staining were used for clinical diagnosis of TBM. These detection methods were compared and analyzed. The results showed that the sensitivities of the 3 detection methods were 28.81%, 16.95% and 37.29%, respectively, and the specificity were all 100%, based on clinical diagnosis. The diagnostic efficiency of GeneXpert MTB/RIF technique was significantly better than that of culture method (x 2 = 6.174, P = 0.013). Although there was no statistically significant difference when compared with acid-fast staining (x 2 = 0.957, P = 0.328), the GeneXpert MTB/RIF technique has the advantage of accurately distinguishing MTB from non-MTB. The above results indicate that GeneXpert MTB/RIF technique has advantage of high sensitivity, high specificity, accuracy and simple operation. The detection time is short to 2 h, which is greatly shortened compared with 4–8 weeks for Rochelle solid culture method. The fibrous materials have high application value for the diagnosis of TBM."
217,Design and osteogenic potential of cell-free porous scaffolds: A correlation between microporosity and bone regeneration in animal model,2021-04-01,"The aim of this study was to design and fabricate a series of cell-free porous scaffolds, based on chitosan/beta-tricalcium phosphate (CS/β-TCP) composite biomaterials, and evaluate their osteogenic potential in terms of ectopic bone formation in mice as a model animal. The scaffolds were fabricated by a coprecipitation process using the CS and β -TCP with different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (1, 2, 4 and 8%) as a porogen. This process gives rise to a series of porous scaffolds with different levels of porosity. The scaffolds were subjected to evaluation for their porosity, pore size and water absorption ability. It was found that the pore sizes of the CS/β TCP scaffolds were larger with the increase of concentration of H2O2. The biocompatibility and osteogenic potential of the scaffolds were evaluated by implanting them intramuscularly in mice. The samples were harvested 8 weeks post-surgery to assess ectopic bone formation. The formation of new bone tissues was observed only in 2% and 4% H2O2 groups in vivo, and area percentage of new bone formation was measured by a modified slice-by-slice approach. The results of this study revealed that the porosity plays a major role in bone formation and optimization of the porosity/pore size of the scaffolding system is essential to trigger their osteogenic potential."

The synthesized products were identified and characterized by XRD, SEM-EDS, TEM-SAED, ITICs, CM and UV-Vis-NIR. Furthermore, the synthesized Zn1-xCoxO nanopowders were used to prepare Zn1-xCoxO/CNT/silicone rubber composites. The electromagnetic parameters and reflection loss values of the prepared composite materials were measured by VNAs. The synthesized Zn1-xCoxO nanopowders were also used to prepare Zn1-xCoxO/Al/siloxane resin paints. A Taguchi L9(33) orthogonal array was adopted to design experimental formulas. The intrinsic emissivities of the prepared paints were measured by ITICs. Experimental and analytical results showed that the particle size of the synthesized Zn1-xCoxO nanopowders after calcination was larger than that of the Zn1-xCoxO nanopowders before calcination, and their shape was close to spherical. The intrinsic emissivities in the 3-5µm and 8-12 µm wavebands were in the ranges of 0.247-0.338 and 0.753-0.781, respectively. The greenness and brightness of the synthesized Zn1-xCoxO nanopowders decreased with an increasing Co content. The characteristic analysis of the prepared Zn1-xCoxO/CNT/silicone rubber composites indicated that a Zn0.85Co0.15O/CNT/silicone rubber composite with a thickness of 4 mm exhibited the lowest RL value of -37.2 dB at 10.5 GHz, and its absorption range of less than -10 dB was located in the frequency range of 9.8-11.3 GHz. The characteristic analysis of the prepared Zn1-x Cox O/Al/siloxane resin paints revealed that the minimum intrinsic emissivities in the 3-5 µm and 8-12 µm wavebands were 0.415 and 0.716, respectively."
219,Impact of waste glass powder on mechanical properties and microstructure of rubber concrete,2021-04-01,"To reduce the pollution of waste glass powder (GP) and waste rubber (WR) on the environment, GP is added into rubber concrete as a mineral admixture. The mechanical properties of rubber concrete incorporating with 0–30% of GP are investigated. The microstructure of rubber concrete is determined through scanning electron microscope (SEM) and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), and the nanomechanical properties are determined by nanoindentation technique. The results demonstrate that the utilization of GP decreases the early strength and elastic modulus of rubber concrete, and more than 10% GP degrades seriously the microstructure. However, the addition of 10% GP enhances the compressive strength and elastic modulus at the later ages, and promotes the generation of calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H) gel that compacts the microstructure of rubber concrete. The nanomechanical properties of the interfacial transition zone are also improved effectively due to the addition of 10% GP."
220,A two-step method to prepare silver nanoparticles ink for improving electrical and mechanical properties of printed silver wire,2021-04-01,"Electrodes and conductors with highly conductive and good mechanical reliability are attracting much attention in the manufacturing of flexible electronics. The printing technology by using nanoparticles conductive ink is one of the promising patterning techniques in flexible electronics manufacturing. In this paper, a two-step method was proposed to prepare the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) conductive ink, and the electrical and mechanical properties of printed silver wire by the AgNPs ink were investigated. The multi-sized AgNPs ink was obtained by one-step microwave approach, and centrifugal concentration as the second step was applied to improve the AgNPs concentration of the ink. Three types of silver inks, including original ink, one time concentration ink and two times concentration ink with Ag content of 2.1%, 4.3% and 8.7% in weight, were used to print silver wires and their electrical and mechanical properties were investigated by self-designed flexible electronics testing platform. The results shows that silver ink processed by one time concentration can achieve a good balance in electrical conductivity and resistance to deformation and fatigue, while the original ink exhibits good performance in bending fatigue resistance but low electrical conductivity and stability in bending deformation, and the two times concentrated ink can provide excellent electrical conductivity and relatively high stability in bending deformation but its resistance to long-term cyclic bending is extremely low. This work will provide a guide for preparing AgNPs ink to improve electrical and mechanical properties of printed flexible electronics."

From the results of XRD, FTIR, SEM and zeta potential, both CAF-LDH and CAF-LDO contained abundant functional groups, such as −OH, NO3− and CO32−. Over 90% removal efficiency for 25.0 mg/L phosphate was achieved with CAF-LDH and CAF-LDO at pH 3–10. The adsorption process quickly reached equilibrium within only 30 min. The isothermal and kinetics data better fit the Langmuir model (LM) and the pseudo-second-order (PSO) model, respectively. Based on the adsorption tests, zeta potential and FTIR, the interaction mechanisms were mainly electrostatic attraction and inner-sphere surface complexation (ISSC).

In the present paper, hierarchical flower-like Bi2O2CO3/Bi2WO6 heterojunctions were prepared via an one-pot hydrothermal approach using Bi(NO3)3 ⋅ 5H2O and Na2WO4 ⋅ 2H2O as raw materials. SDS was used as a structure directing agent. The selective adsorption of SDS on the (001) planes of Bi2WO6 leads to the formation and self-assembly of Bi2WO6 nanosheets, resulting in hierarchical flower-like structures. The generation of Bi2O2CO3 is attributed to the in-situ carbonization of Bi2WO6 by CO32- produced by the decomposition of precipitant urea, forming well-defined Bi2O2CO3/Bi2WO6 interfaces. The flower-like Bi2O2CO3/Bi2WO6 heterojunctions showed enhanced photocatalytic activities for MB degradation, which was mainly due to their large specific surface areas and electric-field-assisted charge transfer at the heterojunction interfaces. The possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed based on the experimental results and band structures."

To that end, cutting force and surface roughness are investigated during spiral milling of wood fiber reinforced magnesium oxide composite based on orthogonal experimental design. The main results are given as follows: resultant force and surface roughness all decrease with the increase of spiral angle and cutting speed, but decrease of cutting depth. Furthermore, the cutting depth had greatest influence on the resultant force and surface roughness, followed by cutting speed and spiral angle.

This study evaluated the effect of a static magnetic field (SMF, 100 mT) on the antibacterial and mineralization properties of MCSNs. MCSNs have been successfully synthesized by a template method. The influence of MCSNs with SMF (MCSNs-SMF) on BMSC proliferation and morphology was assessed by a Cell Counting Kit-8 colorimetric assay and fluorescence microscopy. The apatite mineralization capacity and antibacterial properties of MCSNs-SMF on P. gingivalis biofilms were further investigated. The results indicated that the MCSNs-SMF had a stable pH for 15 days. SMF enhanced silicon release by the MCSNs and induced more apatite mineralization deposition on the MCSN surface when soaked in simulated body fluid. The MCSNs-SMF did not show cytotoxicity on BMSCs and had a stronger antibacterial ability than the MCSNs alone. In conclusion, a moderate SMF could enhance the antibacterial and mineralization properties of MCSNs and serve as a novel effective method for bone infection control and regeneration applications."

This research explores the pioglitazone nanoliposomes effects on sepsis-mediated lung injury and the underlying mechanism. An in vivosepsis model was established by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. An in vitrosepsis model was established using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in RLE-6TN lung epithelial cells. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to detect lung injury, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect lung Caspase-3. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detected IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels. Western blot detected PPARγ/NF-κB and apoptosis-related protein expression (Caspase3, Bax, Bcl2).

234,GlaxoSmithKline126 inhibits the wingless integrated/-catenin signaling pathway to alleviate hyperuricemia,2021-03-01,"Hyperuricemia causes tubulointerstitial fibrosis, leading to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) kidney damage. The activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and EMT processes are closely related to tubulointerstitial fibrosis. GSK126 is the most effective inhibitor of Ezh2. However, whether GSK126 regulates uric acid (UA) metabolism and renal damage caused by hyperuricemia is not clear. In this study, high Ezh2 expression was detected in hyperuricemia cells by Western blot analysis, and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway was activated. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results showed successful transfection of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results showed that the GSK126 and Ezh2 silenced groups were similar, and the UA level decreased. CCK-8 results showed that the GSK126 group inhibited the proliferation of hyperuricemia HK-2 cells. Through qPCR, the GSK126 group reduced Ezh2 expression, promoted Waf-1 expression, and inhibited the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and EMT progression. Immunohistochemistry results were the same. ELISA detection of kidney damage in mice found that GSK126 can alleviate kidney damage caused by hyperuricemia. Therefore, it is speculated that the Ezh2 inhibitor GSK126 mediates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to inhibit EMT progression and alleviate hyperuricemia."

240,Electronic structures and optical properties of Ca/Zr co-doped BaTiO,2021-03-01,"The structure and properties of Ca/Zr doped cubic BaTiO3 ceramics have been studied using the first principles in which chemical elements of Ca or Zr have been partially and uniformly substituted by Ba or Ti sites. The calculated results show that the doping of CaZrO3 and the Fermi surface transfers to the valence band increases the energy band difference. An important contribution to the total state density of the Ca/Zr-doped BaTiO 3system is the 4d orbital of Zr atoms, and a strong Orbital hybridization is caused by the p-d interaction near the Fermi level introduced by Ca/Zr doping. The refractive index (n) for a pure system is 2.525 and 1.617 for a doped system. The doping of CaZrO3 makes it less complicated for BaTiO3 to tetragonal phase after Ca/Zr doping, which improves the overall performance of BaTiO3."

How to design CLD structure to obtain high structural damping ratio is a significant research topic. In this paper, first, a kind of butyl rubber (IIR) with high material loss factor was successfully fabricated by mixing hydrogenated dicyclopentadiene petroleum resin (HDCPD) and polyisobutylene (PIB) oligomers.

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the wear and surface roughness (SR) of different CAD/CAM restorative materials and their antagonists enamel surfaces. Methods: Specimens were prepared from two glass ceramics: Celtra-Duo (CD) and IPS-e.max-CAD (EMAX-C), a high-translucency zirconia: Lava-Plus (LP), a resin-nanoceramic: Lava-Ultimate (LU) and a hybrid ceramic: VITA-Enamic (VE) (n = 9). Enamel samples were obtained from extracted human teeth. Wear by weight loss and (SR) of the CAD-CAM and antagonist enamel specimens was determined after two-body wear testing. Kruskal-Wallis test, One-Way ANOVA, Bonferroni, paired t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank and Spearman correlation tests were used for statistical analysis (p ≤ 0.05). Results: All CAD-CAM materials tested exhibited increased wear from baseline (p = 0.002). EMAX-C and LP showed the highest (SR) following testing. LU and VE showed similar behavior. The type of the CAD-CAM material did not affect the wear and (SR) rates of the antagonist enamel surface. There was no positive correlation between wear behavior and (SR) data for the tested material nor for their antagonist enamel surfaces. Conclusions: Even though tested CAD-CAM materials differed in wear and SR characteristics, they were equally friendly to antagonist enamel."

Using commercial yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the fermentation was carried out at 22 °C, 25 °C, 28 °C, and 30 °C, and the fermentation at 30 °C proved to be the fastest. The alcohol by volume of the final wine after fermentation was 17.5%."
249,Characteristics of microscopic crack and propagation life of forged steel brake disc for high-speed train,2021-03-01,"The organizational structure evolution and life prediction method of brake disc with multi cracks are studied. This thesis analyzed the microstructure transformation in the process of crack propagation through observing the microstructure and anatomy of the failed brake disc. Based on the NASGRO theory and fracture mechanics method, the fatigue life of forged steel brake disc with single crack was calculated under different braking conditions, which is formed by multiple hot spots. Also, on the basis of the coupling effect between multiple cracks, a fatigue life prediction method for forged steel brake disc with multiple cracks was proposed. By comparing the fatigue life with or without considering the crack coupling effect, the thesis proposed that the fatigue life of brake disc is significantly lower than that of brake disc with single crack when it comes to crack coupling effect. The results of bench test are basically consistent with the hypothesis. Therefore, it is of great significance to improve the contact state of brake disc and avoid the appearance of hot spots for prolonging the crack propagation life of brake disc."
250,Machine learning-based modeling of thermoelectric materials and air-cooling system developed for a humid environment,2021-02-01,"The thermoelectric air-cooling system (TE-ACS) has witnessed exponential progress due to its ability in tackling the environmental pollution issues by utilizing renewable energy sources. In Present research focused on, different machine learning models developed to predict TE-ACS parameters and comparisons are made with the empirical models. The empirical models, based on actual experimental data for the same input variables, are developed by using the polynomial fitting method. The machine learning models, especially the nonlinear regressions using the Gaussian exponential method, have shown less error in comparison with experimental results. The highest prediction accuracy of the machine learning model for hot side temperature of thermoelectric material is achieved with R2 = 0.87 and RMSE = 0.52. For the cold side temperature, R2 = 0.92 and RMSE = 0.44. The machine learning prediction for the inside-room temperature results in R2 = 0.86 and RMSE = 1.18. The model for relative humidity inside the room produced R2 = 0.87 with an RMSE value of 0.89. These models may be utilized to evaluate the TE-ACS performance for the larger input values that are difficult or, at times, impossible to perform in the actual experimental setup. Therefore, these machine learning models gives a strong basis for the design and analysis of TE-ACS methods."
251,Study on interaction between bacterial community and microecological environment in rhizosphere soil of tobacco root rot caused by ,2021-02-01,"Tobacco root rot caused by Fusarium solani is a serious soil-borne disease. To better understand its mechanism, Illumina MiSeq sequencing and physicochemical testing were used to analyze the bacterial community, physical and chemical properties (nitrate nitrogen, NN; ammonium nitrogen, AN; effective phosphorus, EP and available potassium, AP), and enzyme activities (catalase, urease, acid phosphatase, sucrase, protease and cellulase) in the rhizosphere soil of healthy and root rot tobacco plants. In the results, in infected samples, the activities of all enzyme were increased, with catalase and sucrase increased by 163.87 and 125.25%; all the nutrients showed cumulative effects, with NN and AN increased by 49.98 and 24.22% respectively. In addition, the OTU abundance, Shannon, ACE and Chao1 indexes of bacterial in infected samples were all lower than those of healthy samples (reduced by 4.64, 8.77, 3.46 and 3.12%, respectively), and the number of OTUs was 30.86% of that of healthy samples. Moreover, the dominant bacterial community and relative abundance are significantly different at phylum, genus and species levels. Specifically, Bacillus and Chujaibacter in diseased samples increased 48.57 and 157.71%, respectively. There was a significant negative correlation of Rhodanobacter to urease activity, AN, NN, and AP. In conclusion, the structure of bacterial communities and potential function in rhizosphere soil of diseased plants are significantly different from that of the healthy plants, and the interaction between biological and non-biological factors of micro-ecological environment in soil played an important role in the bacterial community."

253,Effect of nano-montmorillonite on the properties of multi-wall carbon nanotubes/natural rubber latex nanocomposites,2021-02-01,"Nano-montmontillonite (MMT)/Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/Natural rubber latex composites were prepared by dry-wet lamination method. Montmorillonite and multi-walled carbon nanotubes were combined to form a new type of composite packing network. The ratio of them in the composite packing network was changed by changing the amount of montmorillonite. The effects of this new type of composite filler network on the physical and mechanical properties, aging properties, gas barrier properties, interlayer spacing and glass transition temperature of the composite were studied. The results showed that the tensile strength and elongation at break increased by 21.5% and 14.3% respectively compared with the composite without montmorillonite.

254,Delivery of temozolomide using PEGylated graphene oxide as a nanocarrier,2021-02-01,"In this study, graphene oxide (GO) was functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) via amidation reaction. Furthermore, temozolomide (TMZ) was loaded onto GO-PEG via π–π stacking and hydrophobic interactions. The successful synthesis of GO-PEG nanocarrier and GO-PEG-TMZ were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Drug loading and releasing experiments demonstrate the GO-PEG has a good loading capacity of (6.47 ± 0.08) mg/mg for TMZ and a satisfactory accumulative release rate of 71.12% in 12 h under slightly acidic condition. The CCK-8 assay demonstrated that TMZ and GO-PEG-TMZ had significant inhibitory effects on rat glioma cells, and showed a dose-dependent characteristic, while the inhibition of GO-PEG composite was weak. The feature of loading and delivering anti-tumor drugs using GO-PEG-based carrier may provide potential applications in biomedical therapy."
255,Adoption of graphene composite carbon nanotubes in treatment of infected bone defect of open fractures and its influence on postoperative complications,2021-02-01,"Graphene is widely used in bone graft materials because of its antibacterial properties, good bone formation, and biocompatibility, as well as its promotion of the proliferation of stem cells. This study explored the value of using graphene composites for treating infected bone defects of open fractures and the influence of carbon nanotubes on postoperative scar formation. A vancomycin-loaded reduced graphene oxide/nano hydroxyapatite (VA-RGO-n HA) composite scaffold was prepared. Aligned carbon nanotubes (ACNTs) were prepared by a chemical vapor deposition method. The VA-RGO-n HA and ACNTs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. A cell counting method was also used to evaluate the effect of VA-RGO-n HA on the proliferation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis were adopted to analyze the components of the VA-RGO-n HA composite scaffold. Forty healthy male New Zealand White rabbits aged 3 months old were chosen and randomly divided into five groups: RGO group (infected bone defect model + RGO implantation), RGO-n HA group (infected bone defect model + RGO-n HA implantation), VA-RGO-n HA group (infected bone defect model + VA-RGO-n HA implantation), scar control group (scar model + sterile bandage), and scar model group (scar model + ACNTs), with each group containing eight animals. Changes of animal inflammatory indexes of infective bone defect and the difference of scar healing time in the different groups were analyzed. The results showed that the number of BMSCs on the composite scaffold loaded with 5% VA was significantly lower than that of RGO-n HA. The numbers of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), human smooth muscle cells (HSMCs), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), mouse fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells, and mouse preosteoblastic cells (MC3T3-E1) on the nanotubes were significantly lower than those of control group. The C-reactive protein (CRP) level and white blood cell (WBC) count of the VA-RGO-n HA group were significantly lower than those of the RGO-n HA and RGO groups. The scar healing time of the control group was shorter than that of the model group, indicating that the VA-RGO-n HA composite scaffold prepared in this study had strong antibacterial activity, enabling effective treatment of infected bone defects. ACNTs can effectively inhibit the excessive proliferation of fibroblasts and the formation of hyperplastic scars, providing novel options for the clinical adoption of new carbon nanomaterials."

We used samples from patients with IRP, hematopoietic failure diseases (HDDs), or with complete remission after IRP immunotherapy (IRP-CR). The bone marrow IL-23R+CD4+/CD4+ (Th17 cells) cell ratio was measured by flow cytometry (FCM). IL-6, IL-17, and IL-23 expression levels in the bone marrow supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Differences among the groups were assessed. The IL-23R+CD4+/CD4+cell ratio and the levels of IL-6, IL-17, and IL-23 in the bone marrow supernatant of patients with IRP were significantly higher than those in the HDD, IRP-CR, and healthy groups. The IRP group was compared with the remaining three groups and differences with P <0.05 were considered significant. No significant differences were observed among the HDD, IRP-CR, and NC groups. Taken together, we firstly observed the role of Th17 cells in the occurrence and development of IRP, which provided a new target for the therapy of IRP."
257,Crosslinkable poloxamer  gel as a submucosal cushion for gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection,2021-02-01,"Hypertonic saline solution is used for creating a submucosal fluid cushion (SFC) for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) procedure. However, its short duration time and side effects such as perforation and bleeding have limited the application of SFC. Here, an in-situ gel crosslinked acrylate/thiol Poloxamer 407 (PA-PSH) was used as an SFC for ESD to avoid perforation, and the feasibility and safety of the PA-PSH for ESD was evaluated systematically. Injection of PA-PSH in-situ gel with a high mucosal elevation induced by thiol-ene crosslinked acrylate Poloxamer 407 (PA) and thiol-capped Poloxamer 407 (PSH) in physiological conditions, led to a longer-lasting elevation with clearer margins as compared with glycerol. ESD was achieved precisely without obvious adverse effects and tissue damage. The PA-PSH in-situ gel might be a potential submucosal injection system to improve the ESD technique."
258,Tunable shape memory of thermoplastic polyurethane/poly(lactic acid) blends via morphology control: Performance and mechanism,2021-02-01,"While poly(lactic acid) (PLA) originating from natural resources is considered to be a promising sustainable material for the fabrication of shape-editable biomedical devices, the shape recoverability is limited by its intrinsic brittleness. In this work, shape memory blends were fabricated by modifying PLA with a toughen agent of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). After blending with TPU, the tensile toughness of PLA was significantly improved, resulting in an enhancement of original shape recovery but a deterioration of temporary shape fixation. In particular, the co-continuous structured blend bearing 50 wt% TPU showed the best comprehensive shape memory capacity with balanced shape-fixing and -recovering ratios. The research on the underlying mechanism revealed that the continuous phases and rich interfaces in co-continuous structure promoted load distribution and force transferring, both of which optimized the shape memory effect. Also, regarding to the good biocompatibility of TPU and PLA, the produced materials are potential to be applied in the biomedical engineering field."
259,Interfacial bonding of plating Al on graphene surface through organic aluminum reduction,2021-02-01,"Graphene (Gr) was plated with an Al layer by using an organic aluminum reduction method, and the total adsorption energy and the optimum adsorption location of Al atom on the Gr surface were studied. The interface of the Al/Gr/Al double-interface model was tightly bonded with the Gr layer, and the interface structure was stable. The total adsorption energy of the Al atoms at the central H point of Gr hexagonal lattice was the highest. The Al atoms at C–C bond bridge midpoint B and above C atom T point tended to shift toward the H point, and thus, the H point was the best adsorption site for the Al atoms on the Gr surface."
260,Microstructure and wear resistance of spherical tungsten carbide rein-forced cobalt-based composite coating,2021-02-01,"In order to improve the wear resistance of EH40-C steel, four cobalt-based composite coatings containing 0%WC, 30%WC, 45%WC, and 60%WC were prepared on the surface by plasma transfer arc (PTA). The microstructure and phase of the four fabricated composite coatings were analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy spectrum analysis (EDS), and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). Subsequently, the friction and wear tests in a –10 °C simulated environment were carried out on a BRUKER UMT TriboLab. The wear depth and profile were determined with a noncontact 3D optical profilometer. The results reveal that coating structure of 0%WC + Co composed of network structure and sheet structure, coating structure of 30%WC + Co coating composed of dendritic structure and sheet structure. With the increase in the WC content, the dendritic structure will gradually grow up, and finally turn into fishbone structure. The microhardness of 0%WC + Co, 30%WC + Co, 45%WC + Co and 60%WC + Co coatings is 303 HV0.2, 411 HV0.2, 664 HV0.2 and 701 HV0.2. The wear resistance results indicate that addition of hard phase cast WC can effectively improve the wear resistance of the coating. However, when the content of WC is higher than 45%, the improvement of wear resistance is not obvious. Therefore, the optimum addition content of WC is 45%."
261,Application value of nanostructured lipid carriers combined with exercise rehabilitation training in stroke patients,2021-02-01,"The morbidity and mortality of stroke are high, and nimodipine (NMD) is the only effective drug to treat ischemic dysfunction; however, the traditional delivery system exhibits highly toxic side effects and low bioavailability. The nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) system has the advantages of improving drug solubility and bioavailability. This study analyzed the effects of NLC combined with exercise rehabilitation training in 126 stroke patients admitted to the neurology department of The First People’s Hospital of Lianyungang, Affiliated to Kangda College, Nanjing Medical University from February 2018 to February 2020. The patients were divided into 2 groups of 36 by random number table selection. The T-NMD group received oral NMD tablets combined with conventional rehabilitation training, and the NLC-NMD group received oral NMD and nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC-NMD) combined with exercise rehabilitation training. In both groups, the National Institute of Health stroke scores (NIHSS) were decreased, and the level of serum neurological function correlation index, upper and lower limb Fugl-Meyer assessment, modified Barthel index, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores were increased. The NLC-NMD group showed significantly lower NIHSS and significantly higher serum neurological function correlation index, upper and lower limb Fugl-Meyer assessment, modified Barthel index, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (P < 0.05). The efficacy of the NLC-NMD group was significantly higher and complications significantly lower than the T-NMD group (P < 0.05). NLC, combined with exercise rehabilitation training, significantly affected stroke recovery and is worth popularizing and applying clinically."
262,Immunofluorescence lateral chromatography in combination with detection of hypersensitive C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels in patients with mental disease associated with coronavirus 2019 disease infection,2021-02-01,"Immunofluorescence lateral chromatography (IFLC) is a quantitative detection technique used to screen C-reactive protein and procalcitonin (PCT) monoclonal antibodies with high efficiency and specificity. This study investigated the application value of IFLC combined with the detection of hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and PCT in patients with mental diseases associated with COVID-19 infection. Sixty-four patients with mental disease admitted to our hospital from January to April 2020, were selected as research subjects. Based on the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 in the “Corona Virus Disease 2019 Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme (Byass, P., 2020. Eco-epidemiological assessment of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, January- February 2020. Global Health Action, 13(1), p.1760490.) version 6, all patients were tested using the nucleic acid amplification test for COVID-19 and were divided into two groups of 6 infected and 58 non-infected patients. Subsequently, the patients’ hsCRP and PCT levels were measured using IFLC and an automatic biochemistry analyzer (BA). The results showed that the hsCRP and PCT levels in the infected group were higher than the non-infected group. Additionally, the analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of hsCRP were higher than PCT. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of hsCRP + PCT measured jointly were significantly higher than hsCRP and PCT measured separately. The BA results showed that the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of hsCRP were higher than PCT. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of hsCRP + PCT measured jointly were significantly higher than hsCRP and PCT measured separately. Comprehensive analysis showed that the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of hsCRP + PCT tested using IFLC were significantly higher than using the BA. All of the above differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). It was concluded that the joint detection of hsCRP and PCT by IFLC helped identify and diagnose mental diseases associated with COVID-19 infection."
263,Alginate gel cell microspheres combined with biphasic calcium phosphate ceramics to form a dual 3D programmed culture system for bone regeneration,2021-02-01,"Low cell viability, cell survival rate and unsatisfactory vascularization ability have always been a great challenge for the application of tissue engineered bone. Building a 3D culture system to simulate the micro-environment of seed cells may be a potential method to improve the cell viability, cell survival rate and vascularization ability of tiusse engineered bone. Thus, based on our previous work, we aimed to build a dual 3D programmed culture system for bone regeneration. Stem cell alginate beads were seeded into biphasic calcium phosphate ceramics to form a dual 3D programmed culture system. The content of the culture medium and the growth factors were adjusted based on the expression levels of osteogenesis and angiogenesis related growth factors. This dual 3D culture system was estimated by in vitro and in vivo experiment. The results indicated that alginate gel cell microspheres combined with BCPCs stimulated the regeneration of bone and vessels more effectively than other groups. Our research provides new experimental evidence and a theoretical basis for clinical application of this dual 3D culture system."
264,Production of human cardiomyocytes based on a scalable stem cell culture platform,2021-02-01,"Cardiovascular diseases are serious and have become the main cause of death worldwide. Cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have been widely used in cardiovascular disease modeling, heart development research, drug screening and potential cell therapy. Efficient production of CMs from hiPSCs is crucial for its’ basic research and clinical translation. The three-dimensional (3D) suspension culture system is preferred in CMs culture, as it can achieve large-scale production and obtain more mature phenotype, but a robust stem cell culture platform remains unsolved. We previously established a scalable PSC culture platform (termed AIC) that supports PSC passaging at the single-cell level under 3D suspension conditions. However, the efficiency of hiPSCs derived from the AIC system directed differentiation into CMs remains unclear. The research aims to explore the differentiation efficiency of hiPSCs derived from the AIC system."
265,Comparing the effects of carbon- and silver oxide-particles on the physical and mechanical properties of glass-ionomer cements: An  study,2021-02-01,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different nanofillers incorporated into glass-ionomer cements (GICs). Two restorative GICs (Fuji IX and GlassFill) were selected and divided into four sub-groups: Control (without any added filler); 0.03 Wt.-% single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT); 0.03 Wt.-% multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT); and 10 Wt.-% silver oxide nanoparticles. A total of eight disk-shaped samples from each subgroup were fabricated. Surface roughness, nanohardness and compressive strength of the study groups were statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (P <0.05). Addition of nanofillers enhanced the surface roughness in both GICs. The lowest surface roughness was observed in Fuji IX Control (0.9±0.3 μm). While the highest surface roughness was observed in Fuji IX with 10 Wt.% Ag2O (2.2±0.5 μm). The nanohardness was higher in 10 Wt.-% Ag2O in both Fuji IX (0.5 ± 0.2 GPa) and GlassFill (0.6 ± 0.3 GPa) experimental groups compared to the control and CNTs groups. The highest compressive strength was exhibited by Fuji IX with 0.03 Wt.% SWCNTs (31.8 ±8.0 GPa). Incorporation of 0.03 Wt.-% SWCNTs in GIC seems a promising approach for improving the clinical survival of GIC in the load bearing areas of the oral cavity."

The HPAEpiCs were divided into the control, LPS, LPS + miRNA-NC, and LPS + miRNA-29b-3p groups. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to test the occurrence of apoptosis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for testing the following inflammatory factors: IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α levels. The real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technique was employed to determine the miRNA-29b-3p levels, and related Bax gene of Bcl-2 which were detected by the western blotting technique. Bioinformatics software predictions showed that there were complementary sequences of miRNA-29b-3p included in 3’ UTR of the Bax gene, also the dual luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed the targeting association between miRNA-29b-3p and the Bax gene. In comparison with the control group, the level of apoptosis recorded in IL-6 and TNF-α inflammatory factors of the HPAEpiCs in the LPS group was seen to have increased (P < 0.05), and the level of IL-10 and miRNA-29b-3p reduced greatly (P < 0.05). In comparison with the LPS + miRNA-NC group, the rate of HPAEpiCs apoptosis in the LPS + miRNA-29b-3p group reduced greatly (P < 0.05); while the level of Bcl-2 protein increased (P < 0.05), IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α inflammatory factors, and Bax protein levels decreased apparently (P < 0.05). Negative regulation of the miRNA-29b-3p on Bax gene expression in the HPAEpiCs was recorded. There was an over-expression of the Bax gene reversed action of miRNA-29b-3p on the LPS-induced HPAEpiCs apoptosis and inflammatory factor expression. The over-expression of miRNA-29b-3p can inhibit LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammation of the HPAEpiCs, which may influence the down-regulation of the Bax gene."

269,Preparation and characterization of an elastin nanogel with enhanced biocompatibility and improved entrapment efficiency in prostate cancer cells,2021-01-01,"Nanogels represent an emerging class of drug delivery systems with enhanced renal clearance and serum half-life. However, synthetic polymeric nanogels are immunogenic and less biodegradable than other systems. Protein nanogels, being non-immunogenic; biodegradable; biocompatible; and mechanically, spatially, and temporally tunable, are gaining widespread attention. Elastin, a natural structural component of connective tissue, has enhanced vascular mobility and is highly biodegradable, biocompatible, temperature and pH sensitive, inert in the bloodstream, able to self-assemble, and able to permeate the blood-brain-barrier. In this study, the development of an Elastin Nanogel (ENG) and its functional capacity as a next generation injectable nano-drug carrier was studied. ENG was prepared via an inverse mini-emulsion technique and was characterized and found to be stable at room temperature and cytocompatible with five different prostate cancer cell lines of varied etiologies. Rhodamine-loaded ENG showed enhanced cellular uptake. Blood smear, hemolysis, CBC, PT/APTT, and C3a complement activation assays showed that ENG is vascular tissue compatible and hence meets the objectives of injectable nanogels. The formulated ENG can be efficiently used as an injectable nano-drug carrier for cancer therapy. Moreover, ENG has the potential to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs for targeted drug delivery."
270,Effect of intra-articular injection of adipose stem cells on traumatic osteoarthritis cartilage defects,2021-01-01,"Traumatic osteoarthritis with cartilage defects can lead to mobility problems. Mitotic activity in cartilage is extremely low, and once damaged, repairing can be difficult. The commonly used autologous or allogeneic cartilage transplantation techniques also have certain limitations. In recent years, directed induction of osteoblastic differentiation using adipocytes has been shown to be effective in repairing cartilage defects. However, it is often induced in vitro and is prone to incomplete or over-differentiation. In addition, because of the large differences in the in vivo and in vitro microenvironment, exploring the influence of these differences in the in vivo microenvironment on the directional differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and their effect on cartilage repair is necessary. In this study, a cartilage defect model in rabbits with traumatic osteoarthritis of the left knee was established, and different interventions were conducted in different groups. We determined the effect of directly injecting ADSCs into the joints on repairing cartilage defects in rabbits with traumatic osteoarthritis and analyzed the differences in repair time of newly developed cartilage defects and old cartilage frontal defects. The results indicated that the placement of a stent and injection of ADSCs improved the knee joint activity, increased the expression of BMP and TGF-β protein, and reduced the expression of inflammatory factors, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-α. No difference was found between the new cartilage defect and the old one. By directly observing the cartilage defect, intervention with ADSCs + scaffold increased the connection between the cartilage defect and the normal tissue and improved the cartilage repair effect. These results indicated that directly injecting ADSCs into the joints is an effective approach for repairing cartilage defects in traumatic osteoarthritis, and it was not affected by the age of the defect."

This study is aimed at assessing the action of ergosterone on LPS-induced ALI. Mice on the 7th day of ergosterone prophylactic treatment were intranasally administered with an appropriate amount of LPS one hour before administration. After 12 hours, W/D ratio, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, P-selectin, ICAM-1, NO, SOD and MDA levels were tested by ELISA in the obtained tissues. Besides, western blot was used to detect NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase-1, caspase-1, pro-IL-1β and IL-1β leves. The results indicated that ergosterone pretreatment apparently brought down W/D ratio, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, NO and MDA in lung tissues, and significantly increased SOD levels. Furthermore, ergosterone significantly inhibited the activation of NLRP3 induced by LPS. The results indicated that ergosterone has a significant protective action on ALI induced by LPS, and may inhibit the activation of the NLRP3 signaling pathway."

The level of miR-214-3p in exosomes was analyzed by qPCR and the incorporation of FAM-labeled miR-214-3p from exosomes into MC3T3-E1 cells was evaluated. The expressions of ephrinA2 and RANKL in exosomes were studied. Results: Our results demonstrated that osteocyte-derived exosomes might recognize osteoblasts through the ephrinA2 protein; thus, miR-214-3p in exosomes was transferred into osteoblasts to inhibit osteoblast activity. Meanwhile, we found that osteocyte-derived exosomes could be transferred into osteoclasts to induce osteoclast formation by releasing RANKL. Conclusion: These findings suggest that osteocyte-derived exosomes play an important role in the regulation of osteoblast and osteoclast activity, which might occur via miR-214-3p and RANKL."
273,Eu/Eu/Tb co-activated single-phase GdOS: A high-performance white light emitting phosphor for light emitting diode,2021-01-01,"In this work, we report Eu3+/Tb3+/Eu2+ co-activated Gd2O2 S as novel phosphor materials that can be effectively applied in the white-light emitting diode based on a near-UV chip with sensational performances. The luminescent properties and energy transfer mechanism have been thoroughly investigated. The as-prepared europium/terbium co-doped Gd2O2 S phosphors exhibit strong fluorescence with tunable color output under UV-vis light excitation. Furthermore, a high response to ultraviolet illumination of 398 nm wavelength was observed in the excitation spectra, indicating an excellent match with a light-emitting-diode chip in the dominant emissions. It is found that a tricolor (blue, green and red) emission band which results in a white light emission can be acquired when Eu3+, Eu2+ and Tb3+ ions are all co-doped into the single phase Gd2O2S, and an optimum ion doping level (10 at.% Eu and 0.7 at.% Tb) can effectively emit nearly pure white color photoluminescence with lifetime effectively tuned from 0.55 ms to 1.10 ms. The CIE (Commission International de I'Eclairage 1931 chromaticity) is X = 0.3507, Y = 0.3029. It is therefore expected that the newly found phosphor material with high-performance properties possess great potentials for the future advanced white LED applications."

276,Precise engineering of silver loaded polyvinyl alcohol nanogels for wound nursing care systems in operation room,2021-01-01,"This study was designed to establish the composition of wound bandages based on silver nanoparticle (AgNP)loaded polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanogels. The AgNP nanogel (Ag-nGel) was fabricated by the fructose-mediated reduction of silver nitrate solutions within the PVA matrix. The influence of different experimental limitations on PVA nanogel formations were examined. The nanogel particle sizes were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy and determined to range from ∼10–50 nm. Additionally, glycerol were added to the Ag-nGels, and the resulting compositions (Ag-nGel-Glu) were coated on cotton fabrics to generate the wound bandaging composite. The cumulative drug release profile of the silver from the bandage was found to be ∼38% of the total loading after two days. Additionally, antibacterial efficacy was developed for gram positive and negative microorganisms. Moreover, we examined in vivo healing of skin wounds formed in mouse models over 21 days. In contrast to the untreated wounds, rapid healing was perceived in the Ag-nGel-Glu-treated wound with less damaging. These findings indicate that Ag-nGel-Glu-based bandaging materials could be a potential candidate for wound bandaging applications in the future."
277,Rapid physical preparation of a superhydrophobic surface on copper foil without low-surface-energy materials coating,2021-01-01,"A method is proposed to directly obtain superhydrophobic properties by depositing a coating made of candle soot upon the copper foil surface. The process to prepare a surface of superhydrophobicity is simple and rapid, which was performed just by placing the copper foil over the flame of a burned candle for no more than 10 minutes. The surface contact and slide angles of water were 159° ± 1.8° and 2°, respectively. Furthermore, the wettability on the copper surface of superhydrophobicity was also investigated. We found that the copper superhydrophobic surface prepared by the method had excellent superhydrophobicity for water; acid, alkali and salt solutions; and other liquids. In contrast to the traditional approach to prepare superhydrophobic surfaces, the method proposed in this study not only did not damage the mechanical properties of the substrate surface but also did not require low surface energy materials to be modified. This study provides a new approach for the protection of copper and other metallic materials."
278,Preparation of oxidized corn starch in dry method assisted by kneader,2021-01-01,"In this study, oxidized starch (OCS) with different carboxyl content was prepared by the dry method, with H2O2 as the oxidant and CuCl2 as the catalyst. The optimum conditions were obtained by an orthogonal experiment, under the carboxyl and carbonyl content of 0.6813 and 1.0416% respectively. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and gel permeation chromatography characterized the structures of OCS, and the thermal, gelatinization, viscosity property and its viscosity stability were measured. The results demonstrated that the crystallinity decreased slightly and the A-type crystal remained unchanged after oxidation, and the molecular weight of OCS decreased greatly. The thermal decomposition temperature, apparent viscosity and setback viscosity also decreased. With the increase of carboxyl content in OCS, the cold-water solubility and paste transparency of OCS paste increased gradually, while the viscosity of OCS paste decreased, and the viscosity stability displayed a trend of first increasing and then reducing. The OCS obtained by a kneader had low solution viscosity and high viscosity stability, suitable for sizing high count warp yarns."
279,Fabrication and characterization of polyvinyl alcohol/chitosan/moringa-extract hydrogel patch for wound-healing applications,2021-01-01,"In this study, a wound-healing patch containing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), chitosan (CH) and moringa-oleifera-leaf extract (MOR) blends was prepared. PVA prepolymer (2%) was prepared at 80 °C using a hot-plate magnetic stirrer. Four samples (6 ml-films) of PVA prepolymer with a combination of CH powder (0.5%, PVA+ CH), moringa-leaf extract (2.5%, PVA+ MOR), and both CH and moringa (0.5% and 2.5%, PVA+ CH+ MOR) were prepared using the freeze-thaw method at –40 °C. The tests were conducted with pure PVA as the control group. The physicochemical characteristics were assessed by compound-microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), tensile-strength test using universal testing machine (UTM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The water contact angles measured using ImageJ software proved the hydrophilicity of the fabricated biomaterial, showing watercontact angle 37.55° of PVA+ CH+ MOR. The results of the degradation test using phosphate buffer saline (PBS) also indicate that the CH biopolymer enhances the biodegradability of the hydrogel. On addition of chitosan the degradation temperature increased to 288 °C from 251 °C of pure PVA, while it changed to 302 °C on compounding moringa, proving enhanced strength. The obtained physicochemical properties suggest that the patch combining PVA + CH + MOR can be used as a wound-healing patch."
280,Influence of different but compatible all-ceramic materials and bonding systems on dentin bonding properties,2021-01-01,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of various compatible all-ceramic materials and bonding systems, on the bonding properties of dentin. Five types of commonly used all-ceramic materials (Cerec Blocs, IPS e. max Press, IPS e. max ZirCAD, Incoris Alumina, In-Ceram Alumina) were bonded with three types of adhesives (Multilink N, Variolink N, Relyx Unicem) for nuclear porcelain tile preparation. We evaluated the polymerization conversion rates, shear bonding strength (SBS), and micro-tensile bond strength (TBS) for each combination. The polymerization conversion rates, SBS and TBS differed significantly for all 3 adhesives with each all-ceramic group (P < 0.05). The Relyx Unicem agent had higher adhesive properties compared with the Variolink N and Multilink N agents (P < 0.05). The polymerization conversion rate, SBS and TBS of the five all-ceramic materials differed significantly with each adhesive (P < 0.05). The Cerec Blocs had the highest adhesive performance (P < 0.05). The polymerization conversion rate of adhesives differed with each all-ceramic material, while the dentin bonding strength differed with each all-ceramic material and adhesive. Clinically, all-ceramic materials with a high transparency and low refraction are recommended. For opaque all-ceramic restorations, the curing light time and polymerization reaction rate should be increased to improve the dentin bonding performance."

282,Analysis of curative effect of percutaneous autologous bone marrow cell transplantation for treating nonunion under laser positioning and navigation guidance,2021-01-01,"Fracture end cleaning, local bone grafting, and fixation are the classic treatment methods for fracture nonunion, but patients normally need to wait for a long time to ensure that there are signs of further healing. The purpose of this research is to verify whether precision injection improvement can be developed as treatment associated with autologous bone marrow cell injection to promoting fracture healing. The curative effect of traditional autologous bone marrow injection for the treatment of poor fracture healing is affected by injection accuracy and locally available cell retention the clinical. The curative effect of autologous bone marrow injection can be effectively improved through autologous bone marrow centrifugation and bone grinding at fracture end when combined with preoperative three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) planning. This minimally invasive treatment method is especially suitable for patients with delayed fracture healing within six months of presentation. Patients with nonunion over six months can be treated with improved autologous bone marrow injection. The convenient and minimally invasive method itself will not be difficult for patients, physically and mentally, and the most reliable treatment method for nonunion is to cut and clean hardened bone and implant autologous bone fixation."

284,Repair materials for bone defects of the tibial plateau in primary total knee arthroplasty,2020-12-01,"At present, the number of primary TKA (total knee arthroplasties, TKA) performed has increased annually, and there are a considerable number of patients having bone defects of the tibial plateau. How to choose appropriate repair materials for repairing the tibial plateau bone defects and obtain satisfactory results from primary TKA has gradually become a research focus. Effective repair outcome is the basis of the initial stability of the knee prosthesis, which ensures that patients can obtain satisfactory results within the life expectancy of the prosthesis. Recently, a variety of materials have been used to repair tibial plateau bone defects in primary TKA. In this review, we summarized the advantages and disadvantages of different materials used in repairing tibial plateau bone defects, and hope to provide a certain reference for selection of appropriate materials during treatment. Repair materials applied to repair bone defects of the tibia plateau include traditional materials (structural bone grafts, bone cement, modular metal augments, and tantalum cones), and new materials (autologous chondrocytes, autologous platelet-rich plasma, and tissue-engineered bone). Those materials have shown diverse characteristics, advantages and disadvantages. Traditional repair materials may lead to complications, such as bone resorption, secondary collapse, stress shielding and loosening, while new materials provide new opportunities to treat the diseases during the early stages. However, the clinical safety and long-term efficacy of the above mentioned new materials need to be further verified. Appropriate repair materials should be selected according to the specific size and depth of the tibial plateau bone defects."
285,"Design and development of minocycline-loaded, thermally responsive polymeric nanoparticles for targeted delivery to activated microglia/macrophages in spinal cord injury model: A novel therapeutic strategy",2020-12-01,"Functional motor recovery in spinal cord injury (SCI) is a highly challenging field in biomedical treatment. Minocycline is an effective drug agent for microtubule inhibition and neurite outgrowth of cultured neurons in SCI treatment. In the present report, a facile drug delivery system was designed using a chitosan-assisted thermoresponsive polymer to provide sustained release of minocycline from the copolymeric matrix. Additionally, curcumin nanoparticles encapsulated with a copolymeric matrix have been shown to stimulate anti-inflammatory, functional recovery, and effective neuroprotective effects. The distribution of curcumin nanoparticles into a copolymer drug carrier system with thermo-responsive abilities improved sustained delivery, blood bioavailability, stability, and biocompatibility. These results demonstrated that minocycline-loaded Cur-CS/PNIPAM provides enhanced neuroprotection, axonal growth efficiency, and potentially facilitates functional recovery at the site of SCI injury. Therefore, our data offer a facile combination therapeutic strategy for the treatment and recovery of SCI in humans."
286,The long noncoding RNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 targets microRNA-34a to modulate apoptosis and cytokine secretion from airway smooth muscle cells from asthmatic rats,2020-12-01,"Asthma has a high incidence worldwide and can lead to disability and death. Recently, roles for both long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified in asthma. Here we explore the function of the lncRNA known as PVT1 (plasmacytoma variant translocation 1) and miR-34a in the pathogenesis of asthma, specifically their impact on cellular apoptosis and cytokine secretion from airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). Levels of PVT1 in serum and ASMCs were significantly increased in rats with experimental asthma; we also observed significantly decreased expression of miR-34a. The levels of IL-4 and IFN-γ decreased and increased, respectively, in response to increased expression of PVT1; these findings were associated with increased levels of apoptosis-related proteins and accelerated apoptosis. Suppression of PVT1 expression had a direct impact on the expression of miR-34a; this was associated with an increased proliferation of smooth muscle cells and a diminished rate cellular apoptosis. As the levels of apoptosis-related proteins decreased, apoptosis was reversed; this response also had a functional impact on secretion from smooth muscle cells in response to a mutant form of PVT1. Experiments revealed that PVT1 can bind to the miR-34a promoter and thereby regulate its expression; this action had an impact on the levels of apoptosis-related proteins and the ensuing apoptosis of smooth muscle cells in association with levels of IL-4 and IFN-γ. PVT1 and miR-34a play a critical role in the regulation of the asthmatic responses."
287,Effect of paclitaxel-containing nano-apoliposomes on growth of cervical cancer xenograft tumors in nude mice,2020-12-01,"Our goal was to examine the impact of paclitaxel-containing nano-apoliposomes on cervical cancer xenografts in nude mice. Nude mouse xenograft models of cervical cancer were established in mice that were then divided into two groups (n =10/group). Paclitaxel-containing nano-apoliposomes were administered to the experimental group; the control mice were treated with paclitaxel alone. Tumor development was evaluated in vivo, after which the tumors were resected and weighed; tumor growth inhibition indices were calculated based on both volume and weight. RNA was extracted using a magnetic bead method; expression of Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were evaluated by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Administration of paclitaxel-containing nano-apoliposomes resulted in a diminished rate of tumor growth; both tumor volume and tumor weight were lower in the experimental group when compared to the controls, with 77.91% and 70.27% reductions in volume and weight, respectively. Levels of both transcript and immunoreactive Ki-67 and PCNA proteins were lower in xenograft tumors from the experimental group than in controls. Paclitaxel nano-apoliposomes are more effective and exert stronger anti-tumor effects than paclitaxel with respect to inhibiting the growth of cervical cancer xenografts in the nude mouse model."
288,Identification of core genes and natural immune cells in diabetic retinopathy by integrated bioinformatics analysis,2020-12-01,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most frequently occurring complication of diabetes mellitus and remains a leading cause of vision loss globally. The target of this study was to investigate the changes in immune cell infiltration and core gene expression associated with the progression of DR. Integrated bioinformatics analysis was performed using R software to handle microarray data from gene expression omnibus datasets. In the study, a total of 22 types of both adaptive and innate immune infiltrate cells were evaluated for their association with DR. Our results indicated that specific immune infiltrate cells have close connections with DR, such as monocytes, macrophages M1, activated mast cells, and neutrophils. Furthermore, a total of 66 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that the “Citrate cycle (TCA cycle),” “Oxidative Phosphorylation” and “Purine metabolism” pathways were significantly enriched in DR. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of DEGs mostly included “Cofactor binding,” “Coenzyme binding” and “Oxidoreductase activity.” Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that DEGs were enriched in “Carbon metabolism,” “Oxidative phosphorylation” and “Butanoate metabolism.” Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis showed that OTC, ACSM3, PDPR, and MARS2 were vital genes associated with DR progression. These results indicate that a host of core genes and immune cells possibly play an important role in DR progression."
289,The Yiqi Huashi Tongluo formula combined with a nano-shenkangning preparation improves inflammatory fibrosis in rats with chronic renal failure by regulating the NF-B signaling pathway,2020-12-01,"To observe the clinical efficacy of Yiqi Huoxi Tongluo Formula (YHT) combined with a nano-Shenkangning preparation (nano-SKN) on inflammatory fibrosis in rats with chronic renal failure and to explore its mechanism. The rat model of renal fibrosis in renal failure was produced by unilateral ureteral obstruction. Rats were divided into normal, model, Yiqi Huashi Tongluo Formula (YHT), and YHT+nano-SKN groups, with 9 rats in each group. The pathological changes in serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and renal tissues were compared between the rat groups. The expression of indicators of active NF-κB signaling in renal tissue was analyzed by Western blots. The Scr and BUN level of rats in the Model group increased, and the pathological observations showed obvious inflammatory infiltration and collagen deposition. Markers of NF-κB signaling; intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), nuclear transcription factor-κBp65 (NF-κB p65), phosphorylated NF-κB inhibitory protein (p-IκBα), and IκB kinase (IKKα), all increased in expression level. On treatment with YHT, Scr, and BUN were significantly reduced and expression of the five NF-κB signaling markers dropped. A more substantial decrease in Scr, BUN, and NF-κB signaling markers was observed for the YHT-nano-SKN group, indicating greater clinical efficacy than the single YHT drug. YHT and nano-SKN significantly reduced the extent of inflammatory fibrosis in rats with chronic renal failure via a mechanism that may be linked to regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway."
290,Inhibition of invasion and migration of hepatoblastoma cells by miR-885-5p via targeting of glypican-3,2020-12-01,"Our aim in this study was to explore the effect and mechanism of microRNA-885-5p (miRNA-885-5p) on migration and invasion of hepatoblastoma cells and to explore its downstream targets. First, tissue specimens from 12 children with hepatoblastoma who underwent surgical treatment in our hospital from January 2016 to February 2018 were gathered. The specimens included resected tumor tissue and paired adjacent liver tissue. RT-qPCR was used to detect the relative expression of miRNA-885-5p in hepatoblastoma tissues and cells. Secondly, silencing or high expression of miRNA-885-5p was accomplished by transfecting miRNA-885-5p mimic or miRNA-885-5p inhibitor in hepatoblastoma cells, respectively. Luciferase activity and expression levels of GPC3 protein were measured after transfection. Finally, transwell assays were used to detect the influence of transfection of miRNA-885-5p mimic or miRNA-885-5p inhibitor on hepatoblastoma metastasis and invasion. The expression of miRNA-885-5p in liver tissue was higher than that in hepatoblastoma tissue (P <0.05), and the relative expression of miRNA-885-5p in LO-2 cells was lower than that in HuH-6 cells (P <0.01). Results of western blot showed that high expression of miRNA-885-5p down-regulated GPC3 expression in HuH-6 cells, while inhibition of miRNA-885-5p induced GPC3 expression (P <0.05). Transwell experiments showed that high expression of miRNA-885-5p reduced invasion and metastatic ability in HuH-6 cells (P <0.05). GPC3 mRNA is a target of miRNA-885-5p in hepatoblastoma, and GPC3 inhibition is essential for miR-885-5p inhibition of invasion and metastasis in hepatoblastoma cells. The miRNA-885/GPC3 axis is a novel potential target for the treatment of metastatic hepatoblastoma."

292,Regulatory effect of modified Taohe Chengqi decoction on pancreatic islet alpha cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetic rats,2020-12-01,"This study aimed to observe the effect of modified Taohe Chengqi Decoction (MTCD, trade name: Jiangtang Sanhuang Tablet) on incretin and the regulating effect of MTCD on the dysfunction of islet alpha cells. Sixty Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: a control group, diabetes model group, lowdose group (0.781 g of MTCD/kg), high-dose group (1.562 g of MTCD/kg), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor group (0.47 mg/kg). Type 2 diabetes was simulated through intraperitoneal injection of 35 mg/kg of STZ and feeding with high glucose and lipid. Blood glucose in the high-dose group was lower than in the model group in the eighth week of the experiment. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that insulin was significantly reduced after model establishment but increased after treatment with MTCD. The change in glucagon was opposite to that of insulin. After using MTCD, GLP-1 and GIP content increased, but DPP-4 content decreased. The assessment of immunohistochemistry showed that glucagon positive expression in the model group was high, and it declined after treatment with low and high doses of MTCD (P <0.05). A MagBeads total RNA extraction kit was used to isolate RNA. The qRT-PCR results indicated that the change in the trend of GIPR mRNA expression was similar to that of GLP-1R. The GIPR mRNA increased significantly after using MTCD, and the protein expression of GLP-1R and GIPR showed the same trend in the Western Blot. It is concluded that MTCD could be a potential incretin regulator to reduce the over release of glucagon and produce a multi-target hypoglycemic effect."

294,Therapeutic effect of rutin-loaded poly lactic-co-glycolic acid nanoparticles on gingiva of periodontitis rats,2020-12-01,"Periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease of the periodontal support tissue and is caused by microorganisms in the plaque biofilm. Periodontitis can lead to gingival atrophy and alveolar bone absorption. Inflammation control is an important treatment strategy for periodontitis. Rutin (rutin glycoside of quercetin) has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. It can inhibit oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions in model animals by regulating the MAPK pathway. However, the specific mechanism of Rutin in the treatment of periodontitis is not yet clear. Additionally, the bioavailability of Rutin requires improvement. Therefore, in this study, bioinformatics was used to predict the targets of Rutin, the differentially expressed genes were screened, and the related molecular pathways were verified by animal experiments. We found that local application of Rutin-loaded poly lactic-coglycolic acid nanospheres was beneficial to cytokine regulation. Rutin nanoparticles have therapeutic effects for periodontitis, which may be achieved by inhibiting the inflammatory reaction."

Then the network pharmacological properties of the top 10 potential AA targets were analyzed, CTSK and MMP9 were identified as the major proteins in the protein interaction network, and gene enrichment analysis showed that both proteins were closely related to biological processes and signaling pathways associated with the regulation of osteoporosis. In addition, the binding energy and molecular interaction pattern between AA and CTSK or MMP9 were predicted by molecular docking analysis. Finally, through in vitro experiments, it was demonstrated that AA significantly inhibited osteoclast differentiation, and expression of CTSK and MMP9 proteins in osteoclasts. In conclusion, this study identified AA as an inhibitor of CTSK and MMP9, and has the potential for the treatment of osteoporosis."
296,Comprehensive evaluation of the effect of dental unit on the dimensional accuracy of CoCr multi-unit fixed bridge,2020-12-01,"To study the effect of units on dimensional accuracy through comprehensive assessments. SLM technique (SLM group) and conventional casting (CAST group) were used to produce 40 FPDs, respectively. A total of 40 specimens of each group were divided into 5 subgroups, including 6 units (n = 8), 8 units (n = 8), 10 units (n =8), 12 units (n =8), and 14 units (n =8). The vertical error was expressed by measuring the edge clearance using the silicon replica. Horizontal and local errors were measured by reverse engineering. The surface of the SLM and CAST specimens was observed by SEM. One-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) and Tukey-post-hoc analysis were used to compare inter-group differences of different units. The t-test (a = 0.05) was used to analyze the difference between SLM and CAST in the same unit. The average value of vertical, horizontal accuracy and surface errors of SLM were better than those of CAST group (P <0.05), but vertical, horizontal accuracy of 12 and 14 units were statistically different from 6, 8, 10 in SLM group (P <0.05). In cast group, a statistically significant difference was shown among different subgroups in vertical, horizontal accuracy and surface errors (P < 0.05). On SEM observation, the surface of SLM specimens was relatively flat and regular, with less spheroidized protuberance. In conclusion, the number of units had an effect on dimensional accuracy of SLM FPDs when it was higher than 10. SLM technology is superior to conventional casting in size accuracy and surface quality."

The highest catalytic performance of Cp2TiCl2 for the synthesis of PCMS was achieved with a Cp2TiCl2/DMDCS molar ratio of 1/30. Afterwards, the synthesized PCMS precursors were dissolved in xylene to prepare PCMS fibers by electrospinning. The morphologies of the prepared PCMS fibers were observed by FE-SEM. A PCMS solution concentration of 1.5 g/ml was most suitable for electrospinning. The prepared PCMS fibers exhibited a uniform structure and a smooth surface. Finally, the prepared PCMS fibers were cured and calcined to produce SiC fibers. The microstructures of the prepared SiC fibers were characterized by XRD and FE-SEM coupled with EDS. The XRD analysis indicated that the calcination temperature should be above 1100 °C. The SEM image showed that the SiC fibers prepared at a calcination temperature of 1100 °C exhibited a smooth surface and a uniform diameter of approximately 4 µm. The EDS analysis indicated that a small amount of TiC was present in the prepared SiC fibers, which effectively improved the mechanical properties of the SiC fibers."
298,Fast response photodetectors based on Van der Waals coupled organic molecules with MoS2-graphene,2020-12-01,"Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) have many excellent characteristics, especially in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. In this paper, we take advantage of P-type organic molecule zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) to modify two-dimensional MoS2 field effect transistor. In the Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM), it was found that organic molecule ZnPc has a P-type doping effect on MoS2 which significantly reduces the surface potential, indicating the charge transfer direction. Through low-temperature (20-300 K) photoelectric test, the activation energy of MoS2-Graphene heterojunction can be acquired with 0.15 eV, which is higher than that of MoS2-ZnPc-Graphene heterojunction. At room temperature, dark current of the ZnPc-modified device was reduced by three orders of magnitude and its detection ability has been improved by an order of magnitude. Different from the traditional vertical semiconductor structure, this research shows the potential of atomic plane interface manufacturing with two-dimensional materials and downward scalability of vertical P –N junction devices integration."

The influence of the hybrid particles on the flame retardancy of PVA was analyzed by TG, cone calorimeter, SEM, Raman and XPS. The results show that: the hybrid particles can catalyze the formation of carbon, which increases the amount of carbon. Meanwhile, the barrier effect of h-BN nanosheets can inhibit the release of pyrolysis volatiles and keep the surface integrity of carbon residue. And PVA composites release fewer hydrocarbons and produce less combustible gases during pyrolysis; meanwhile, the composites release less gaseous substances such as CO than pure PVA and are less toxic. The flame retardant property of PVA material has been improved."

302,Properties and process optimization of nanocomposites with organically modified montmorillonite as environment-friendly flocculants for natural rubber latex,2020-12-01,"Rising awareness in the environmental crisis triggers the search for earth-friendly material to use in existing processes. In rubber compounding, an environment-friendly flocculant is of great interest. This article highlights the use of a low cost, widely abundant minerals—organic montmorillonite (OMMT) as the environment-friendly flocculant for rubber compounding. We statistically evaluate several key compounding parameters, i.e., OMMT content, stirring speed, flocculation temperature using orthogonal analysis. The dependent variable—flocculation time was approximated through non-linear regression and agrees-well with experimental results. We achieved a flocculation time of only 11 s using 14 phr of OMMT with a mechanical stirring speed of 2000 r/min and temperature of 40 ° C. Then, natural rubber (NR)/OMMT composite was prepared by flocculating natural rubber latex with the environment-friendly flocculant. To distinguish the influence of environment-friendly flocculant on the properties of rubber composite material, two other NR/OMMT composites were prepared using formic acid as flocculant as well as traditional mechanical mixing. The properties of NR/OMMT rubber composites prepared by three methods were evaluated. Interestingly, NR/OMMT composite prepared with environmentfriendly flocculant—OMMT has higher tensile strength, higher elongation at break, and lower storage modulus than NR/OMMT composite prepared by conventional mechanical blending. The composite prepared with environment-friendly flocculant OMMT is similar to the composite prepared with formic acid as flocculant. This is related to the intercalated structure formed within the rubber matrix and the presented approach enables a distribution of filler within the rubber matrix as good as those by formic acid. Careful analyses of microstructure by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), further confirmed the good dispersity of filler using the present approach, thus substantiating the feasibility of OMMT as an environment-friendly flocculant."

In this paper, the relationship between microstructure and the corrosion performance of this alloy after undergoing welding thermal cycling was investigated. The 7N01 alloy was subject to repeated thermal cycling using a Gleeble machine to simulate the welding process. The corrosion mechanism of the post-weld alloy was subsequently investigated via potentiodynamic polarization and intergranular corrosion tests. Transmission electron microscopy analysis was used to determine the amount and concentration of precipitates with different thermal cycles, which caused variance of corrosion potential and the galvanic corrosion. The highest corrosion resistance was observed from the post-weld microstructure with a high η precipitate content. With natural aging, the precipitates in the microstructure continuously change, resulting in improvement of the corrosion resistance of the 7N01 alloy."

Therefore, the LBP (acidic polysaccharide, 22–25 KD) could be used for pharmaceutical and cosmetic candidate preventing UVB damage."
308,The effect of nutrition nursing on hemodialysis and biodialysis membrane complications,2020-12-01,"In recent years, continuous hemodialysis has become a common treatment for end-stage renal disease. To reduce the incidence of infections, hemodialysis requires a clean environment. Dialysis rooms shall be dry, well-ventilated, sterilized with ultraviolet light, and miscellaneous personnel should not enter and leave the operating room to prevent cross infection. Importantly, there needs to be scientific nutritional care. To respond to these concerns, researchers developed screening methods that combine biomedical tests and classifiers to identify potential complications including peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients. However, the screening requires at least one day to complete (depending on the timing of biomedical test) because the technology cannot be operated by the patients themselves. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of nutrition nursing on hemodialysis and biodialysis membrane complications."

It was found that Mn2+ addition into the zinc electrolytes improved the electrochemical performance of lead–silver (0.69%) alloy anode; and decreased overpotential of lead–silver (0.69%) alloy anode in the zinc sulphate acidic solutions during zinc electrolysis. Moreover, the peak values of oxygen evolution reaction increased with increased content of Mn2+ during cyclic voltammetry study. In addition, addition of Mn2+ onto zinc sulphate acidic solution resulted in decreased corrosion current of lead–silver (0.69%) alloy anode. It should be noted that, agitation at this anodic potential improved the electrochemical performance of lead–silver (0.69%) alloy anode in zinc sulphate acidic solution with varying amounts of Mn2+. Moreover, possible hydrogen ions were attracted to sulfate negative ions on lead–silver (0.69%) alloy anode. Finally, impedance results showed that, the corrosion resistance of lead–silver (0.69%) alloy anode increased with increased Mn2+ addition after two hours of potential decay period."

We conducted a series of bioinformatics analyses on these different gynecological cancers. After downloading mRNA microarray data on these gynecological cancers from the TCGA database, we applied a differential analysis. We combined the differential genes obtained from each disease sample and obtained 2,353 public differential genes (P <0.01). Through a weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we obtained five functional disorder modules, and found the essential genes to be LHFP, DNAJC27, GIMAP4, MCM6, and AIM1L. The analysis results showed that dysfunctional genes are associated with ameoidal-type cell migration and DNA replication. We predicted the regulator using cpRNA and a pivot analysis of the transcription factors. Studies have shown that miR-21-5p and miR-300 regulate three modules, MSC regulates m3 and m5, and YBX1 regulates m4 and m5. All are involved in the regulation of m5, and the co-regulated core gene of m5 is MCM6. We believe that MCM6 has a central regulatory role in a disease network and that MCM6 can be considered as a core biomarker for gynecological pan-cancer."

314,Study on facial nerve activation pathway based on nanometric magnetic beads,2020-11-01,"This study was conducted to investigate the mechanism of facial nerve recovery through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) after facial nerve trunk damage. Facial nerve surgery was performed on rats to establish a paralyzed animal model with or without intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of Pam3CSK4 (TLR2 agonist). All nucleic acids were extracted using nanometer magnetic beads. At 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16 days after the surgery, the score of the blink reflex, the motion of vibrissae, and the motion of nose were analyzed to assess the function of facial nerves. Evaluated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunofluorescence staining (IF), Morphological changes in facial nerve and brainstem were analyzed. The expressions of TLR2 and NF-κB p65 in the brainstem were detected by quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting, and IF. TEM revealed that the facial nerve fiber diameter was shortened, and the organelle was swollen and demyelinated in the operation group. The IF results revealed that the expressions of NF-κB p65 and TLR2 in the brainstem were increased significantly in the operation group together with the control group. RT-PCR demonstrated that the mRNA expressions of TLR2 and NF-κB p65 in the brainstem were low in the control group, as well as in the sham group, whereas there were significant increases in the mRNA expressions of TLR2 and NF-κB p65 in the operation group. Western blotting revealed a significant increase in the expression of TLR2 protein after the surgery compared to that in the control group. After subjecting the rats to facial nerve surgery and i.p. injection of Pam3CSK4, the protein expressions of TLR2 and NF-κB p65 were upregulated dramatically in the Pam3CSK4-operation group compared to that in the control group and were also significantly increased than those in the operation group. Both facial nerve dysfunction caused due to facial nerve surgery (exacerbated by co-treatment with Pam3CSK4) and the expressions of NF-κB p65 and TLR2 were increased significantly. TLR2 might be an innovative gene target and a novel option for the clinical applications of facial paralysis immunotherapy."

The behavior, weight, plasma, malondialdehyde content in the brain homogenate, and total superoxide disodium alcohol were assessed after the treatments. Mice treated with nanofatty acid were easily provoked, hyperactive, and had significantly reduced body weight as compared to the control mice (P <0.05). These findings suggest that polyunsaturated fatty acid can reduce the levels of lipid peroxidation and the activity of total superoxide dismutase in mice. Our results suggest that nanofatty acid exposure has a protect effect on the nervous system."

STAT4 acts as a transcriptional activity factor to regulate the transcription of many genes and is potentially a regulatory factor for AMPKα transcription activity. To confirm the regulatory effect of STAT4 on AMPKα and the effect of STAT4 on osteogenic differentiation, the promoter sequence of AMPKα was analyzed via bioinformatics, the STAT4 overexpression vector was constructed and transfected into human osteoblast-like cells MG-63 by cationic liposome, fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blotting technologies were used to detect the effect of STAT4 on the expression of AMPKα. MTT and ALP activity assays were also used to verify the effect of STAT4 on the proliferation and maturation of osteoblasts by regulating AMPKα expression. Our results showed that STAT4 was a co-transcriptional regulator of AMPKα1 and AMPKα2, which combined the enrichment region of CpG on the promoter sequence of AMPKα1/2. Overexpression of STAT4 significantly increased the expression of AMPKα1 and AMPKα2, which promoted the proliferation and maturation of osteoblasts.

326,Optical and electronic properties of croconates dye molecules adsorbed on TiO brookite nanocluster for dye sensitized solar cells application,2020-11-01,"Density functional theory simulations were employed to explore the geometric, electronic and optical properties of two croconate dye molecules adsorbed on TiO2 brookite nanocluster. The calculations were based on determination of conjugate length, absorption spectra and light harvesting efficiency. The absorption energies, absorption spectra and electronic states of the dye-TiO2 complex were calculated using TD/DFT. The analysis of the excited state properties shows that CR1 and CR2 showed excitation around 580 nm and 680 nm respectively with a corresponding maximum light harvesting efficiency of 66% and 33.9% for CR1 and CR2 respectively. The absorption wavelength support that the croconate dye molecules can improve the efficiency of DSSCs as they can absorb the near infrared photons which increases the absorption range of DSSCs on the solar spectrum. The adsorption energies of CR1 and CR2 on TiO2 brookite are 3.93 eV and 5.53 eV respectively, suggesting a stable grafting of the dyes onto the surface of the semiconductor. The shifting of the absorption wavelength towards the infrared region upon adsorption gives probability of more electron transport into the large band gap of TiO2."
327,Boosting rate capability of ionic liquid supercapacitors by copolymer-derived activated hollow carbon nanospheres,2020-11-01,"Herein, a novel activated hollow carbon nanospheres (AHCNSs) with enlarged specific surface area (SSA) of 1796 m2 ú g-1 and pore volume (Vp) of 1.33 cm3 ú g-1 was synthesized from poly(aniline-co-pyrrole) hollow nanospheres via KOH activation method.

328,Microstructure and mechanical properties of a high-carbon bainitic steel containing Si/Al by different heat treatment processes,2020-11-01,"The present study aims to investigate the microstructure and mechanical properties of 0.79 C wt% bainitic steel containing Si and Al by three heat treatment processes: austempering and tempering (B-T), two-step austempering (2S-A) and the austempering-quenching-partitioning (AQP). The optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) were employed to analyze the microstructure of samples. The results demonstrate that the sample subjected to the AQP process exhibited a multiphase microstructure with martensite, filmy retained austenite (RA) and fine bainitic laths. The AQP sample evidenced a high tensile strength of 1705 MPa, yield strength of 1254 MPa, a better total elongation of 16.6%, product of strength and elongation (PSE) of 28 GPa% and the impact toughness of 33 J among all heat treatment processes. The higher strength and toughness could be ascribed to the fine bainitic ferrite as well as an appropriate amount of filmy retained austenite. A fraction of martensite that was formed during the quenching step at 110 °C possibly divided the untransformed austenite into small areas, which could refine the microstructure. EBSD analysis showed that the AQP sample exhibited a higher proportion (64%) of boundary misorientation angle greater than 15° than that of the 2S-A. These high angle boundaries can improve the toughness of steel."

Round cavities, centered on the cemento/enamel junction, 2 mm in diameter and 2 mm in depth were prepared on the buccal, palatal or lingual surfaces of premolar teeth to have a total of 60 cavities. One side of the tooth received selective enamel etching and both sides were restored using one of 3 restorative materials (n = 10): Aelite LS posterior/All-bond SE, Estelite Sigma Quick/Bond Force, or Filtek P90/P90 System Adhesive. The teeth were fatigued for 5000 thermal cycles, and the marginal sealing was challenged with 50% ammoniacal silver nitrate. The interface was analyzed and the leakage score was calculated. Two-way ANOVA revealed that Filtek P90 (25.5±17.4) had lower leakage than Estelite Sigma Quick (63.1±34.5) and Aelite LS Posterior (64.2±41.8) with self-etching. With selective etching, the three materials showed reduced leakage in enamel. A significant difference (P <0.05) was found between leakage in enamel and dentin for the Aelite LS Posterior selective etch group and for Estelite Sigma Quick. Selective etching reduced enamel leakage for all materials in one-step self-etch materials. Two-step self-etch adhesives bond better to enamel and dentin than one-step resin-based adhesives."

Ag and TiO2 nanoparticles were blended into the powder of a commercially available GIC restorative material at 5% (w/w). Unblended powder was used as a control. One hundred twenty samples were prepared from two study groups and one control group (n = 10). CS, DTS, and FS were evaluated using a universal testing machine, while hardness was measured by Vickers microhardness testing. The data obtained were analyzed using One-way analysis of variance and the Tukey?s test (p < 0.05). GIC containing Ag and TiO2 nanoparticles significantly improved the CS, DTS, and hardness compared to the control group (p < 0.05). However, the FS was not much affected by the addition of either of the nanoparticles (p >0.05). TiO2 blended GIC demonstrated significantly higher CS (154.20+2.38) and DTS (13.2±0.5 MPa) compared to control 117.2±1.2 MPa and 7.2 ±0.8 MPa, respectively. While Blend of GIC+Ag nanoparticles showed the highest FS (29.0±0.7 MPa). Additionally, the blend of GIC+TiO2 exhibited the highest hardness (90.4±1.1 VHN). Ag and TiO2 blended GICs might guarantee their use in occlusal or higher stress-bearing areas."

333,Facile designed poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-containing nano-platform carried dual drug system to improve progressive combination cancer therapy against human osteosarcoma cells,2020-10-01,"We have designed a methodology to achieve treatment-actuated modifications in a tumor microenvironment by utilizing synergistic activity between two potential anticancer drugs. Dual drug delivery of Sorafenib (Sf) along with Cisplatin (Pt) exhibits a great anti-cancer potential, as Sf enhances the effect of Pt treatment of human osteosarcoma cells by providing microenvironment stability. However, encapsulation of Sf and Pt obsessed by poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)-based nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) is incompetent owing to unsuitability between the binary free Sf and Pt moieties and the polymeric system. Now, we display that Pt can be prepared by hydrophobic covering of the drug centers with dioleoylphosphatidic acid (DOPA). The DOPA-covered Pt centers can be co-encapsulated in PLGA NPs alongside Sf to stimulate excellent anticancer property. The occurrence of the Pt centers suggestively enhanced the encapsulations of Sf into PLGA-NPs. Formation of the nanocomposite ([email protected]) was confirmed by FTIR and X-ray spectroscopic techniques.

334,Study on array antennas combined with nanoparticles for enhanced microwave hyperthermia of breast cancer,2020-10-01,"Tumor hyperthermia is to heat tumor tissue with biological thermal effect that can kill cancer cells when achieved effective treatment temperature. However, the temperature distribution of hyperthermia is uneven and it can not be accurately oriented to the tumor region. In this paper, an array antenna which can realize large-scale heating was designed for tumor microwave hyperthermia. ZrMOF-Cys nanoparticles (ZMC NPs) were prepared as the sensitizer of microwave hyperthermia. In the experiment of hyperthermia, array antenna and ZMC NPs are combined to achieve the goal of conformal hyperthermia and enhance the effect of hyperthermia. ZMC NPs have excellent heating effect, biodegradability and low cytotoxicity. ZMC NPs were injected into tumorbearing BALB/c mice by tail vein. Due to enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR), ZMC NPs can enrich tumor sites to the greatest extent at 6 h. After 6 h of injection, the mice were treated with array antenna. The experimental results indicate that the combination of array antenna and ZMC NPs makes the temperature of tumor site higher than that of surrounding normal tissue, which has an excellent therapeutic effect, and the tumor inhibition rate reaches 87.52%. Phantom models experiments are also proved that the combination of array antenna and ZMC NPs can achieve the effect of conformal thermotherapy. This work provides a new direction for the development of conformal hyperthermia."

The results exhibit the discovery that urushin nanoparticles inhibit cell proliferation, which is related to the inhibition of DNA replication and the regulation of the cell proliferation cycle. HPLC results demonstrated that the pharmacological effect of urushin nanoparticles was directly related to the drug concentration present within the studied cells. Hence, urushin nanoparticles can effectively enter cells and then effectively inhibit cell proliferation."

Biogenic zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) obtained from Arisaema triphyllum plant extract were synthesized and characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy, XRD, TEM, and EDX. The presence of various plant extracts and the zinc oxide capping of ZnONPs was confirmed using UV-visible spectroscopy, further confirming the existence of ZnO in the 400–430 nm region based on its specific surface plasmon resonance. XRD patterns showed ZnONP-centered cubic crystalline assembly, while electron microscopy showed that the formation of spherical ZnONPs varied from ∼10 nm to 15 nm in diameter. Strong ZnONPs bands were established, as verified by EDX. The anticancer properties of ZnONPs prepared with different extracts were evaluated using esophageal cancer cells. High levels of anticancer activity against the two esophageal cancer cell lines, EC109 and TE8, were observed. The morphological changes of the esophageal cancer cells were evaluated using AO-EB and nuclear staining biochemical methods. Hemolysis assays with human erythrocytes showed excellent bio-compatibility with ZnONPs.

337,DNA methyltransferase 3 beta regulates ras related domain family 1 methylation leading to enhanced proliferation and migration in gastric cancer cells,2020-10-01,"Silencing expression of RASSF1A, which is induced by DNA hypermethylation, contributes to proliferation and migration in gastric cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms of this process remain unclear. In order to investigate the effect and mechanisms of RASSF1A methylation on proliferation and migration of gastric cancer, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (5-AZA-CdR) were used to interfere with expression of DNMT3B and RASSF1A in gastric cancer AGS cells. Fe3O4–SiO2 nanoparticles were used to extract mRNA for RT-qPCR, and RT-qPCR and western blotting were used to measure the effect of RASSF1A expression on the expression of Caspase 3, Bcl-2, and Bax in AGS cells. MTT and cell scratch assays were used to assess the proliferation and migration of AGS cells. Our findings show that DNA methyltransferase inhibitors inhibit expression of DNMT3B, which leads to an increase in the expression of RASSF1A, Caspase3, and Bax at both the mRNA and protein levels, and inhibits the expression of Bcl-2. Thus, inhibiting the expression of DNMT3B and altering levels of DNA methylation can promote the expression of RASSF1A, regulate the expression of apoptosis-related genes, and inhibit proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells. It is helpful to explore the pathological mechanism of endometrial cancer and provide theoretical basis for RASSF1A as a potential therapeutic target of gastric cancer."

This method can also identify the important components in these samples. To test the application of the Terahertz Time-Domain Spectrometer (THz-TDS), our work focused on the identifying isomers of catechin (an important compound in tea) and the difference among green, black, and white tea. We detected the properties of pesticide residues such as thiamethoxam. Thiamethoxam with similar structure was added into the tea samples to test the resolution of the system. In this work, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-means clustering algorithms were employed to identify green, white, and black tea.

340,Vertical distribution pattern of  genes and bacterial CO fixing potential in the South China sea,2020-10-01,"In this study, the cbb genes which encode the key enzymes in the Calvin cycle were used as functional markers to investigate the distribution pattern of CO2 fixing potential of autotrophic bacteria at different depths of the South China Sea (SCS). The results revealed that cbb gene abundance was similar between the surface and the deep layer of SCS, over two fold higher than the middle layer. The types of cbb genes showed dramatically different distributions with depths. Metagenomic amplicon sequencing revealed that Synechococcus was the main genus containing cbb genes in the surface layer, along with Rubrivivax and Limnohabitans in the middle, and unclassified Epsilonproteobacteria in the deep. Furthermore, the surface layer had the highest CO2 fixing potential due to that Synechococcus had a high CO2 fixation capacity and relatively high autotrophic growth rate. The difference in the distribution of bacterial species and therefore cbb types with depths was potentially affected by the variation in light intensity and concentration of dissolved oxygen, inorganic carbon and reducing substances."

It exhibited ultra-high removal of triphenylmethane dyes for AF, MG and BF from aqueous solution, in which the maximum adsorption capacities are much higher than those of most reported adsorbents. The higher absorption for triphenylmethane dyes can be attributed to the positive surface charge, the main existing mesopores and macropores, and larger specific surface area of the prepared 2MgO · B2O3 · 2H2O sample, which make the absorbent and anionic dye molecules existing both the stronger electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonds of N–H· · · O and O–H· · · N. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm were found to conform to pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir model. The competitive adsorption for BF and MG and the adsorption mechanism were also investigated. The as-prepared sample is of larger adsorption capacity and good reusability, which makes it valuable in potential wastewater treatment application."

348,Study on spinning stability and microstructure of mesophase pitch,2020-10-01,"The effect of spinning temperature on phase stability, rheological stability, and thermal stability of mesophase pitch (MP), naphthalene-based mesophase pitch (AR) and microstructure of pitch filament were investigated in this study. Results showed that the interface stratification of anisotropic and isotropic phases, local enrichment of isotropic phases and extensive enrichment of isotropic phases existed in the spinning process for mesophase pitch. The local enrichment of isotropic phase was observed in MP and AR at the spinning temperature of 320 °C. The interface stratification of anisotropic and isotropic phases and extensive enrichment of isotropic phases were generated in MP when the spinning temperature reached 340 °C. This phase separation reduced the rheological stability and thermal stability of mesophase pitch and then affected the spinning ability. The inhomogeneous pores were also formed in the MP and AR mesophase pitch filament at the spinning temperature of 340 °C."
349,The synergetic effect of straining and N-doping in graphene for enhanced oxygen reduction reaction performance,2020-10-01,"Carbon-based catalysts are engineered by either atomic-scale heteroatom doping or intrinsic structural tuning. However, their synergistic effects are yet to be well-understood. Herein, we report a theoretical investigation, based on first-principles simulations, devoted to the catalytic characteristics of graphene in an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), where graphene is designed with different curvatures and doped with individual N atoms. We discover that the synergistic effect of straining and nitrogen doping (N-doping) can be more effective in improving the performance of ORR compared to N-doped graphene, strained graphene, and other graphenerelated structures. Such a synergistic effect can be attributed to the fact that N-doping reduces the bandgap, promotes electron mobility, and facilitates the transfer of electrons to O2, whereas straining enhances the electronic orbit coupling interaction between the substrate and the adsorbed O2. In the future, our study will have important implications in understanding the synergistic mechanism of straining and N-doping in graphene, and thus, designing novel carbon-based catalysts."

351,Spatial conformation measurement of gold nanorods translocated through a solid-state nanopore,2020-10-01,"The solid-state nanopore has been developed as a powerful biosensor to detect individual molecules and nanoparticles. The operational principle of the technique was to determine the volume, concentration, and zeta potential of the particles from the electrical signals as nanoparticles passing through the pore. Here, gold nanorod samples were used to measure the dynamic translocation process though a nano channel. Gold nanorods have a high throughput in silicon nitride nanopore sensing because of their positive charge characteristics. Meanwhile, a set of varied shapes of nanorods was modeled in nanopore transport. Rod-like nanoparticles were found to adjust partial conformation to enter and pass the pore, and it was found that the dynamic process of nanorod translocation is the result of a combination of electrophoresis and electroosmotic action between nanopores and nanoparticles.

Moreover, the wear form of the base material and the FSP-modified area was ""furrow + adhesion"" comprehensive wear form, in which the base metal was mainly adhesive wear and the FSP-modified area was mainly furrow wear. The grain refinement and hardness of the FSP-modified region obtained at a rotation speed of 1000 rpm and a forward speed of 10 mm/min were improved, and the wear resistance was the best."

354,Study on uniaxial stress intensity of MOS channels along different crystal planes induced by SiN-film,2020-10-01,"The process conditions for depositing SiN film on small-sized MOS along different crystal face channels to introduce stress are the same. However, since the elastic stiffness coefficient of channel Si material is anisotropic, the stress intensity introduced in small-sized MOS channels along different crystal planes is different. It is necessary to consider it while designing and manufacturing small-sized strained MOS. In this paper, the uniaxial strained Si PMOS and NMOS with 40 nm channel along different crystal faces were produced by compressive stress and tensile stress SiN film respectively. Quantitative results of uniaxial stress intensity of MOS channel along different crystal planes induced by the same process SiN films were obtained by measuring device transfer characteristics and corresponding theoretical calculations. The results indicate that, for strained NMOS induced by the tensile stress SiN film, (100) and (110) crystal plane channels are subjected to 0.8 GPa and 1.6 GPa tensile stress; for strained PMOS induced by the compressive stress SiN film, (100), (110), and (111) crystal plane channels are subjected to compressive stresses of 1.1 GPa, 0.8 GPa and 1.6 Gpa, respectively."
355,Preparation and characterization of a fly ash and cement-based foam composite,2020-10-01,"Industrial waste fly ash and ordinary Portland cement (PO42.5) were used as the main raw materials, Ca(OH)2 as the alkali activator, modified rosin soap as the foaming agent, and glass fiber as the reinforcing agent. A physical foaming technology was chosen to fabricate a fly ash and cement-based foam composite. The effects of water-to-binder (W/B) ratio and glass fiber addition on the performance of the foam composite were studied. The structure formation and reinforcement mechanism of the foam composite were discussed, and the optimal formulation was determined, which provides a new technical approach to utilize fly ash and improve the strength and reliability of foam cement products. The results show that different water-to-binder ratios directly affect the stability of the pores during the foaming process, and the glass fiber has a protective effect on the foam. When the W/B ratio is 0.5, meanwhile the addition of glass fiber is 1.5%, the fly ash and cement-based foam composite can achieve better physical performance: the dry density is 368 kg/m3, the water absorption rate is 39.12%, and the 28-day compressive strength is increased by 86.31% (reaching 3.47 MPa) compared to that of the sample without a glass fiber."
356,Preference of three scarab beetle species to floral cues,2020-10-01,"The role of floral visual cues was studied in both sexes of three nocturnal scarab beetle species (Holotrichia oblita, Holotrichia parallela, and Anomala corpulenta). Flower patterns were designed using n-petal rose curve and radial gradient tools. Bioassay of plain colored patterns showed that both sexes of H. oblita and H. parallela preferred yellow and white. In contrast, A. corpulenta showed sexual differentiation in preferences. Comparison between given radial gradient patterns and their color components indicated that a radial gradient was necessary in both sexes of H. oblita rather than both sexes of H. parallela to elicit the highest response. Sexual differentiation was found in A. corpulenta. Among 4-, 8-, and 12-petaled patterns, the 4-petaled patterns were most preferred by all of the test insects, regardless of species and sex. Choice assays that provided both odor and visual cues suggest that olfaction may be the primary sensory modality in the three scarab species."
357,"Oxycodone versus morphine for titration analgesia after laparoscopic gynecologic surgery in postanesthesia care unit: A prospective, randomized trial",2020-10-01,"We want to compare the efficacy and side effects of oxycodone and morphine in the management of postoperative pain by titration in patients who underwent laparoscopic gynecologic surgery because of neglect of postoperative analgesia and rare literature of intravenous oxycodone used in PACU, China. Thirty adult female patients were scheduled for elective laparoscopic gynecologic surgery under general anesthesia. The patients were randomly assigned to either morphine sulfate injection group (Group M, n = 15 cases) or oxycodone hydrochloride injection group (Group O, n = 15 cases). All the patients were given an intravenous PEG nanometer drug delivery system. Furthermore, when they arrived at the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), a visual analog scale (VAS) was used to evaluate postoperative pain. Also, the patients were given 3 mg oxycodone or morphine for titration when the pain VAS score was more than 30 mm, and the pain and sedation scores were re-evaluated after 5 minutes. The titration stopped if the VAS score was ≤ 30 mm otherwise the titration continued as per the above method until the VAS score was less than 30 mm. The required titration dosage, times, and time of oxycodone titration were noted and they were all remarkably lower than those of morphine titration group (P < 0.05). The incidence of side effects in Group M was statistically significantly higher in Group O (P < 0.05). More so, oxycodone titration showed faster analgesic effects, less analgesic drug consumption, and lower incidence of adverse complications during postoperative pain management when compared to morphine titration. The reliability and effectiveness of the PEG nanometer drug delivery system were simultaneously proved."

Methods: DFT, docking, MD simulations were used for designing the new compounds. Docking was performed to identify the molecular interaction between the compounds-receptor. The anticancer study in vitro was evaluated against (MCF-7). The QSAR model was predicted based on; chemical reactivity.  Results: The compounds 3, 5–7, 10–12 and 14–16 represented a significant interaction score through Docking experiment.

This model is statistically significant with good predictive power. Statistical QSAR derivative model with good predictive power. Conclusion: This study introduces experimental indication toward investigation of the synthesized compounds as the candidate of cancer therapy."
359,Effect of inclusion on performance of A6N01 aluminum alloy joints,2020-09-01,"In order to study the effect of inclusion on performance of A6N01 aluminum alloy joints, the N-A6N01 and C-A6N01 aluminum alloys with different inclusion in amount and size were compared. Results show that the larger inclusions in amount and size in the N-A6N01 joint cause more pronounced degradation in the tensile strength than the C-A6N01 joint. However, the N-A6N01 joint shows a superior fatigue strength to the C-A6N01 under the tensile fatigue, this probably because the degradation in the tensile strength contributes a uniform performance mating between the base metal and WM, which reduces the stress concentration during the tensile loading process, and thus improving the fatigue strength."
360,Insights into the structural evolution and electronic properties of deficient-electron sodium chloride clusters,2020-09-01,"We have explored the structural evolution and electronic properties of cationic sodium chloride (NaCl)+ n (n = 1–8) clusters. The global minimum of cationic (NaCl)+ n clusters have been extensively searched using CALYPSO method combined with DFT calculations. The structural evolution of (NaCl)+ n clusters can be divided into three stages: linear structure, planar ring-like structure and three-dimensional structure. It is worth to note that cuboid structure is more common in the cluster series as the cluster size increases. (NaCl)+ 4 clusters is identified as ""magic number"" clusters by means of the relative stabilities analyses. The following chemical bonding analysis indicate that the stability of (NaCl)+ 4cluster mainly comes from the interaction between Na 3s and Cl 3p atomic orbitals."
361,Effect of silica fume-enhanced carbon nanotube dispersion on the strength and damping properties of cement composites,2020-09-01,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) tend to agglomerate in cement paste, which impedes the effect of performance reinforcement. This paper applies silica fume as an active factor to enhance the dispersion of CNTs and investigates the influence of silica fume on the strength and damping properties of CNT-reinforced cement composites. Mechanical strength tests and dynamic mechanical analysis on specimens with different contents of CNTs (0%, 0.1% and 0.2%) and silica fume (0%, 5%, 10% and 15%) are conducted. The microstructure is characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and the pore size distribution is measured by Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP). Due to the CNT dispersion enhancement, both the number of gel pores and the size of microcapillary pores are reduced. The incorporation of silica fume also facilitates the interfacial friction between CNTs and cement hydration products and promotes heat generation, when reciprocating loads are applied. The result indicates that the mixture proportion of CNTs and silica fume strongly influences the extent of the dispersion enhancement, which is optimized at 0.1% and 5%, respectively. Excessive addition of either CNTs or silica fume will hinder CNT dispersion and subsequently reduce the strength and damping properties of the material, which should be avoided in practical applications."
362,Oxaliplatin-loaded monomethoxy (polyethylene glycol)–poly(-lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles induced neuropathic pain through the pro-inflammatory effect of microglia in the spinal dorsal horn mediated by Zic2/membrane adapter protein 12,2020-09-01,"The aim of this study is to investigate the effect and mechanism of oxaliplatin (OX)-loaded monomethoxy (polyethylene glycol)–poly(d, l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (mPEG–PLGA) nanoparticles on neuropathic pain induced by pro-inflammatory action of Zic2/membrane adaptor protein 12 (DAP12) on microglia in the spinal dorsal horn. We have used websites, namely, String, Coexpedia, and Geneontology, for gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses as well as co-expression analysis. The obtained core genes served as targets for OX-induced neuropathic pain. EMSEMBL and BDGF predicted the promoter site of DAP12. Further, mPEGPLGA nanoparticles loaded with OX were injected intravenously into the mice to construct a mouse model of OX-induced neuralgia. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qrt-qpcr) was used to detect the transcription level of the target gene, while the target gene translation level was detected by western blot. The co-expression analysis of the first 250 genes revealed that the target genes were Tyrobp (DAP12), C1qb,  Laptm5, Cd53, C1qc, Foxd1, Foxc1, Tbx15, Mafb, and Zic2. PROMO was used to predict the binding site of Zic2 at DAP12. As expected, the protein and mRNA expressions of Zic2, Tyrobp, IL-1β, TNF-α increased in OX mice. Based on the results of the investigation, we conclude that one of the mechanisms of OX-induced neuropathic pain may be related to IL-1β and TNF-α expression by microglial cells (in the spinal dorsal horn) through Zic2/DAP12."
363,Protective behavior of volatile corrosion inhibitor on atmospheric corrosion process of carbon steel under thin electrolyte liquid film of chloride solutions,2020-09-01,"The corrosion process of carbon steel and corrosion resistance behavior of volatile corrosion inhibitor (VCI) under thin electrolyte liquid film containing chloride was investigated by electrochemical measurements and surface characterization. Results indicated that composite VCI was composed of sodium molybdate and sodium benzoate, and exhibited higher corrosion resistance in 3.5% NaCl solution compared with absence of VCI. The corrosion current density obviously decreased with presence of VCI, and the synergies between binary components increased the corrosion inhibiting rate on carbon steel to up to 90%. The corrosion current density of carbon steel increased with increased temperature after volatilization of VCI. A closed container was carried out to mimic atmospheric corrosion condition, and its vapor corrosion inhibition property was evaluated in this closed container. Results showed that the VCI acted as an inhibitor by suppressing anodic dissolution and metallic ion transfer through the formation of protective film. It was also observed that the variation of carbon steel surface with volatilization of VCI was assessed by atomic force microscope (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The anodic process for carbon steel without VCI affected the corrosion rate due to accumulation of corrosion products, while the morphology of carbon steel was hardly changed with volatilization of VCI. The results showed that the VCI volatilized to the surface and form to protect film. VCI was automatically volatilized into gas, which protected steel from corrosion. This composite VCI can then be applied as a significant corrosion inhibition method."
364,Spatial distribution and content detection of gefitinib in tablets using confocal micro-raman spectroscopy mapping,2020-09-01,"In this study, we aim at establishing a method to evaluate the spatial distribution and content of gefitinib in tablets without destroying the tablets. The content of gefitinib tablets was determined by HPLC. Using confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy, with a wavelength of 785 nm and power of 10%, gefitinib, starch, and hydrated magnesium silicate were scanned. Tablets with five concentrations of gefitinib (15.63–31.25%) were scanned with a 1000 × 1000 μm spectral resolution and live video imaging was performed. The surfaces of gefitinib tablets were scanned and images were obtained by a continuous scanning method. Characteristic Raman spectra of tablets were obtained after surface scanning and map reviews of tablets with five concentrations of gefitinib for rapid and accurate identification. The characteristic spectral bands of gefitinib, starch, and hydrated magnesium silicate were 1620 cm–1, 480 cm–1, 1350 cm–1 respectively. Comparing the surfaces of the tablets, it was found that the tablets with a flat and round surface are more suitable for Raman spectroscopy. Live video imaging and scanning maps of five concentrations of gefitinib were performed. The results showed that the product with the content of 16.12% had a good mixing homogeneity. In conclusion, confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy can detect the spatial distribution and content of gefitinib tablets without destroying tablets."
365,Influence of different rhombic surface textures on the tribological performance of water-lubricated bearings,2020-09-01,"Water lubrication has gradually replaced oil lubrication for a wide range of marine stern bearings. However, due to poor water carrying capacity, the tribological performances of water lubricated bearings can be improved by incorporating surface textures. In this work, rhombic textured thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) specimens, 3D-printed with different heights/depths, 1 mm bulge, 0.5 mm bulge, 0.5 mm dimple, and 1 mm dimple, were tested for their tribological performances when they were lubricated by water and were compared to nontextured specimens. The friction coefficient, wear mass, and microscopic surface topography of the specimens were collected at a common working load (0.4 MPa) and speed (from 50 to 350 rpm), and at low-speed and heavy load (50 rpm and 0.8 MPa) conditions. Experimental results reflect that the rhombic surface texture can effectively improve the friction and wear performances of TPU materials. The friction coefficients of most textured specimens are smaller than those of non-textured specimens under various working conditions. The surface wear conditions of all textured specimens are superior to non-textured specimens, since the rhombic surface texture produces additional hydrodynamic lubrication by creating converge and cavitation effects and prevents abrasive particles from accumulating on the friction surface. Through experimental demonstration, the 1 mm bulge rhombic texture is the best of all the tested textured specimens. This finding can provide a reference for practical industrial applications."
366,Extraction of norovirus based on nanomagnetic beads and establishment of a fluorescence quantitative detection method,2020-09-01,"Norovirus infection is the main cause of epidemic acute gastroenteritis outbreaks. As a result, norovirus merits careful attention. Acute gastroenteritis caused by norovirus is very harmful, necessitating effective prevention and monitoring. This study extracted norovirus using the Fe3O4 nanomagnetic bead method while establishing a rapid and sensitive quantitative norovirus detection method for emergency use. Norovirus RNA was extracted from norovirus-positive stool samples, norovirus-specific primers were designed, and SYBR Green I fluorescent dye was used to construct specific fluorescence quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Norovirus in the sample was successfully detected with the quantitative RT-PCR method established in this study, with a measured cycle threshold value of 28.73; the melting temperature value of the PCR product was approximately 83.5 °C. Additionally, by analyzing melting curve with quantitative PCR and evaluating the repeatability of the detection method, the performance of the reaction system in terms of specificity and repeatability was determined to be good. The fluorescence quantitative detection method established here can rapidly and effectively detect norovirus, and the method has good specificity and high repeatability. Currently, there is a trend of norovirus infection becoming increasingly severe. Thus, this rapid and sensitive fluorescence quantitative detection method will play a significant role in the monitoring and detection of norovirus and is thus worthy of promotion and application."
367,"Synthesis of a 9,10-dihydro-9-oxo-10phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide-based reactive flame-retardant curing agent",2020-09-01,"This paper aims to prepare a new curing agent, reactive flame retardant (DTF), through one-pot synthesis of 9,10-Dihydro-9-oxo-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DOPO), formaldehyde and triacetonediamine for Epoxy resin (EP). This new DTF was successful prepared through Fourier-transform infrared, 1H NMR, and 31P NMR spectroscopy. The flame-retardant epoxy thermoset was prepared using the 4′4-diaminodiphenylmethane (DDM) as a co-curing agent. The analysis results using the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that DTF can cure EP and improve the carbon residue yield of epoxy thermoset after burning. It observed that if the content of phosphorus was 1.0 wt%, the limiting oxygen index (LOI) of EP/DDM/DPT-4 was 30.4%, and UL94 reached the V-0 rating. The highest tensile property of the epoxy thermoset reached 98.56 MPa (P content = 0.5%), whereas the highest flexural property reached 137.28 MPa (P content = 0.75%), and the highest impact property reached 24.1 KJ · m–2 (P content = 0.5%)."
368,Effect of -axis tilted orientation ZnO thin film on shear-mode bulk acoustic resonator in liquid environment,2020-09-01,"ZnO has been widely used as piezoelectric materials in bulk acoustic resonators, especially in shear-mode film bulk acoustic resonators (FBAR). In this paper, we studied the effect of c-axis tilted ZnO thin film on shear mode FBAR in liquid environment. Mechanical impedances of FBARs are compared between shear-mode and longitudinal-mode wave due to their different orientations of ZnO thin film. It is found ZnO thin film with 43° c-axis tilted angels induces quasi-shear-mode acoustic wave only. The Q values of FBAR with 43° c-axis tilted ZnO are 256.94 in air at 0.8148 GHz, and 34.34 in water at 0.814 GHz, respectively. The shifts of the resonant frequencies are proportional to the square root of the product of viscosity and density of liquid medium, which is consistent with Kanazawa-Gordon theory and verified by actual experiment."
369,Effect of heat treatment on structure of nickel-based catalysts,2020-09-01,"Nickel-based catalyst is the general-purpose catalyst with a wide application and good performance. Widely used in fine chemicals, petrochemicals and other industries, it has received continuous attention from researchers. Taking silica gel (SiO2) and HZSM-5 molecular sieves as carriers, and Ni(NO3)2 · 6H2O and Cu(NO3)2 · 3H2O as precursors, in the work we prepared a series of NiO/SiO2, NiO/HZSM-5 and NiCu/HZSM-5 catalysts by impregnation method. Focused on the effects of heat treatment (baking) temperature and time on the structure of the catalysts, the structure of the catalysts was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy. The results showed that in terms of carriers, HZSM-5 had stronger interaction with active metal particles than that SiO2 presented. It could better prevent the sintering agglomeration of catalytic particles during heat treatment, which is beneficial to preparing catalytic particles with smaller particle size. SiO2 exhibited better thermal stability for higher heat treatment temperatures and longer heat treatment time. At the same time, the heat treatment at the high temperature for a long time was liable to cause sintering growth of the active metal particles of the catalysts. The selection of suitable heat treatment process conditions was critical to obtaining the highly active nickel-based catalysts. The work briefly discussed the effect of heat treatment temperature and time on the structure of the catalysts, expecting to provide the useful reference for the preparation technology of supported nickel-based catalysts."
370,Preliminary screening of gastric cancer related transcripts based on nanometric magnetic beads,2020-09-01,"The aim of this study was to use current genomics methodologies to screen for gastric cancer (GC)-related gene expression and to compare expression levels associated with GC and paracancerous tissues. These findings will be considered together with patient clinicopathological data with the goal of identifying new tumor markers and novel directions for diagnosis and treatment. GC-associated gene expression profiles were identified in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases; these resources facilitated identification of genes that were differentially expressed in GC and adjacent normal tissues. Genomics screening identified ∼49 genes that were expressed at comparatively high levels and 65 genes that were expressed at comparatively low levels in association with GC. Moreover, specimens from fifty-six patients diagnosed with GC who underwent gastrointestinal surgery between March 2017 to September 2018 were used to generate RNA that was evaluated by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR in order to confirm differential expression of genes encoding orosomucoid 1 (ORM1), hepsin (HPN), uridine phosphorylase 1 (UPP1), and glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB). The nucleic acid of these samples was extracted by nanometric magnetic bead method. Among our findings, GPNMB was expressed at relatively high levels in association GC, while both ORM1 and HPN are expressed at relatively low levels in these tissues and expression of UPP1 remained unchanged. Taken together, our findings suggest that genomics methodologies can be used to identify differentially expressed genes in a comparison of GC to adjacent paracancerous tissue. Our findings also suggest that the transmembrane glycoprotein GPNMB may play a role in promoting the incidence and development of GC."

To evaluate the effect of triamcinolone acetonide-loaded nanoparticle capsules on improving the structure of the retina and pancreas, we measured blood glucose levels and investigated the pathological changes in the retina and pancreas. The effect of triamcinolone acetonide-loaded nanoparticle capsules on the morphology of the retina and pancreas of the rats with DR was determined and compared among the normal group, model control group, positive control group, and triamcinolone acetonide-loaded nanoparticle group. After treatment with triamcinolone acetonideloaded nanoparticle capsules for 2 months, the blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels were significantly lower (P < 0.01) and the pathological changes were less severe in the triamcinolone acetonide-loaded nanoparticle group than in the model control group. In addition, the arrangement of the photoreceptor cell layers in the retina was organized, intracellular and extracellular edema in each layer was reduced compared with that in the model control group, the capillary lumen was not occluded, and the peripheral cells were slightly edematous in the triamcinolone acetonide-loaded nanoparticle group. Triamcinolone acetonide-loaded nanoparticle capsules could effectively reduce the blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels and improve the structure of the retina and pancreas in the rats with DR."
374,Study of aldo-keto reductase AKR7A3 inhibits the proliferation gastric cancer cells via miR-199mediated suppression of MAPK activity,2020-09-01,"Gastric cancer (GC) is a common malignant tumor; as such, it will be critical to have a larger understanding of the mechanisms underlying GC development. In this study, we explore the mechanisms by which the enzyme, aldo-keto reductase family 7 member A3 (AKR7A3) inhibits the proliferation and migration of GC cells via its role in regulating the synthesis of microRNA (miR)-199. We found that miR-199 expression was comparatively lower in GC compared to that detected in normal para-cancerous tissue; proliferation and migration of GC cells was augmented in response to overexpression of miR-199. Furthermore, AKR7A3 regulated expression of miR-199 in cells of the SGC-7901 GC line; miR-199 in turn promoted the downregulated expression of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Taken together, our results indicate that AKR7A3 acts to modulate proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis of GC cells via the actions of miR-199. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the development of targeted therapy for GC."
375,Porous hydroxyapatite ceramics coated with biomimetic peptides for induced osteogenesis,2020-09-01,"Biomimetic peptide has attracted extensive attention in bone tissue repairing owing to its excellent biocompatibility and stability. Hydroxyapatite ceramics (HAP) possess both excellent mechanical properties and good biocompatibility. To study the effects of bionic peptide D9KIPKAS(pSer)VPTELSAISRGDS on the interfacial activity and biological properties of hydroxyapatite ceramics, porous HAP ceramics were prepared using ammonium carbonate as a pore-forming agent. To explore the influence of surface modification on the interfacial activity of porous HAP ceramics when applying different methods, surface modification was carried out using physical adsorption (HAP-p-PP2) and a chemically grafted polypeptide (HAP-c-PP2). X-ray diffraction was used to characterize the crystal morphology of the porous HAP ceramics before and after sintering. The results of FTIR and XPS showed that bionic peptides were successfully grafted onto the surface of a porous HAP ceramic. An SEM graph shows the adhesion and spread of BMSCs on the materials. Meanwhile, the results of in vitro cell experiments showed that HAP-c-PP2 can better promote BMSC proliferation. In conclusion, bionic peptide D9KIPKAS(pSer)VPTELSAISRGDS with multifunctional functional groups is more conducive to the adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of BMSCs which can make it play an effective role in osteoinduction in bone tissue engineering."

Patients with cerebral thrombosis admitted to our hospital from April 2017 to May 2018 were randomly divided into the control and observation groups. Data on the clinical history and blood parameters of the patients were compared. After treatment with the protein binding PEG-PLA-NPs, the plasma viscosity and whole blood viscosity of the observation group were significantly higher (p < 0.002) than those of the control group. The effective rate (93.3%) in the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group (71.1%). The nanoparticles were characterized by high drug loading, high encapsulation efficiency, suitable preparation and purification methods, optimal particle size and shape, and controlled drug release. Protein binding PEG-PLA-NPs, therefore, could be suitable modalities for the treatment of cerebral thrombosis, and be effective in improving patient conditions and subsequent rehabilitation."
377,Targeted study of thyroid-stimulating hormone antibody coupled with PLGA-COOH nanoparticles for thyroid cancer,2020-09-01,"In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of all-trans-retinoic acid (PLGA-COOH nanoparticles) on the induction of dedifferentiation of thyroid cancer and the enhancement of iodine uptake. Patients (32 cases) with pathologically confirmed thyroid cancer (24 differentiated and 8 undifferentiated) received all trans-retinoic acid (1.0–1.5 mg/kg) for six weeks. Whole-body imaging was performed after 72 h. Using the American phogamma camera, the radioactivity counts of each pixel in the metastasis was measured by the semi-quantitative method of region of interest (ROI). Changes in uptake radioactivity of the metastases were compared before and after PLGA-COOH nanoparticle induction. The size of the metastasis was determined by ultrasound, X-ray, or computed tomography (CT), and the serum thyroglobulin (TG) was determined by radioimmunoassay. After radioiodine treatment, the average measurable iodine uptake of different sites of metastasis was significantly lower than that before treatment. After 32 patients were treated with PLGA-COOH nanoparticles, the uptake of a single lesion was increased in 14 cases (43.8%), no significant change was found in 7 cases (20.8%), and the uptake of one lesion was decreased in 6 cases (25%). In 827 cases, the metastasis decreased, 12 cases remained unchanged, and 7 cases increased. There was no correlation between the pathological type and the change of a lesion. After induction, serum TG decreased in 12 cases (40%), increased in 11 cases (36.7%), and remained unchanged in 7 cases (23.3%). Serum TG level was not related to a change in iodine uptake ability. In 12 cases (37.5%), two indexes were changed (e.g., increased iodine uptake, reduced ROI, or decreased serum TG). Thyroid-stimulating hormone nano interventional therapy breaks through the single and limitation of traditional treatment of thyroid diseases. PLGA-COOH nanoparticles can play an important role in the differentiation of differentiated thyroid cancer cells and the transformation of undifferentiated thyroid cancer cells. PLGA-COOH nanoparticles provide an effective method to induce the treatment of undifferentiated thyroid cancer."
378,Performance comparison of CuPc and 2T-NATA in organic light-emitting devices,2020-09-01,"Using CuPc as the hole buffer material, the effect of 2T-NATA and CuPc as hole buffer materials in similar structure on the performance of devices is studied. For this reason, the ITO/CuPc (20 nm)/NPBX/DPVBi (20 nm) (15 nm)/Alq3: Rubrene (10, X nm)/Alq3 (40 nm)/LIF/Al (5 nm) light-emitting device is designed. Referring to the previous papers on similar structure devices, the best effect is that the thickness of doped rubrene is 20 nm. In this paper, the thickness of Alq3 doping is 10 nm, the thickness of rubrene is adjusted to 5 nm, 10 nm, 15 nm, 20 nm and 25 nm, and the buffer thickness of CuPc is selected at 20 nm according to the previous experimental results. The experimental results show that when the thickness of rubrene is 20 nm, the yellow light and blue light of the light-emitting materials tend to balance, and the device is close to the white light device. The brightness and efficiency of the device are the highest, reaching and 21050 cd/m2 5.527 cd/A respectively. Compared with 2T-NATA as the buffer material, its luminous efficiency and brightness are improved. Through the analysis of the experimental results, we find that CuPc as a hole buffer material reduces the hole carrier injection barrier, improves the hole injection ability, and enhances the recombination probability of hole and electron, improves the luminous efficiency and brightness of the device. It is concluded that 2T-NATA is more suitable than CuPc in the aspect of practical application and energy saving. The advantage of CuPc is that it can inhibit the diffusion of chemical components in ITO to the hole transport layer, which is beneficial to the improvement on device performance and life."
379,Study on the effect of peritoneal dialysis tube materials on chronic failure analysis related infection,2020-09-01,"The material membrane dialysis catheter is required for the reproduction of dermatobacteria and fruit. 20 cases of peritoneal dialysis were treated with antibacterial materials and distilled catheter. Compared with that of the control group, the skin level of the 16 expansion group was lower. At the second generation, it was a variety of Sphingomonas under the order of S. The difference of species abundance between groups is mainly the rare species in the control group. The results showed that the use of long-term materials in prevention and treatment of peritoneal dialysis infection has a beneficial long-term effect."
380,FeO methylprednisolone plus calpain inhibitor protects against spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats,2020-09-01,"To investigate the neuroprotective effects of pretreatment with Fe3O4 methylprednisolone plus calpain inhibitor against spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury (SCI) in rats. A total of 18 male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham operation, model, and pretreatment + SCI groups (receiving 25 mg/kg Fe3O4 methylprednisolone plus calpain inhibitor) (n = 6 each). The SCI model was established by clamping the left renal inferior abdominal aorta. Hindlimb motor function was evaluated 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after reperfusion. At 48 hours after reperfusion, spinal cord tissues were collected for histopathological examination, measurement of oxidation product accumulation (malondialdehyde, MDA), and antioxidant enzyme activity assays [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX)]. Motor function scores were compared using non-parametric rank sum (Kruskal-Wallis) test, and mean tissue MDA content and antioxidant enzyme activities were compared using one-way analysis of variance. Compared with the sham operation group, the model group showed significantly increased MDA content (2.95 vs. 5.90 g mg; P = 0.023); significantly increased GSH-Px activity (0.31 vs. 0.78 U/mg; P = 0.001); significantly decreased SOD (16.03 vs. 8.37 U/mg; P = 0.001) and CAT (1.24 vs. 0.54 U/mg;  P = 0.002) activities; and significantly decreased hindlimb motor function score at 6 hours (21 to 15.5;  P =0.001). Compared with the model group, the pretreatment + SCI group showed significantly decreased MDA content (5.90 vs. 3.27 mg; P = 0.0355); significantly decreased GSH-Px activity (0.78 vs. 0.36 U/mg; P = 0.001); and significantly increased SOD (8.37 vs. 14.79 U/mg; P = 0.001) and CAT (0.54 vs. 0.89 U/mg; P = 0.043) activities. Histopathological changes were significantly less severe in the pretreatment + SCI group than in the model and sham operation groups (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with Fe3O4 methylprednisolone plus calpain inhibitor can prevent SCI by improving the balance between oxidation and antioxidant systems."
381,A density functional theory study of metalloporphyrin derivatives act as fluorescent sensor for rapid evaluation of trimethylamine,2020-09-01,"A fluorescent sensor based on metalloporphyrin was developed for trimethylamine (TMA) evaluation. Density functional theory (DFT) has been performed to investigate the design mechanism of fluorescent sensor. Fourteen metalloporphyrin (MP) models were selected to find the influence of metal atoms and substituent groups on the binding performance of fluorescent sensor. The optimized geometry structures, relative energies, mulliken charges, spin densities, and four frontier molecular orbitals together with binding energies of these fluorescent sensors were investigated. AgP sensor has the lowest relative energies before and after exposure to TMA, which make AgP sensor better than the others to go through more than one pathway. Binding energy results revealed that the metalloporphyrin sensors with different metal atoms and substituent groups cause remarkable changes in TMA binding performances. Thus, theoretical investigations can be used to extend the fluorescent sensor in to TMA related analytes in different detection requirements, and perhaps other molecule."
382,Cytotoxicity to cervical cancer cells of FeO magnetic nanoparticles coated with cholic acid,2020-09-01,"This study examined the effect of nanosized ferric oxide (Fe3O4) particles coated with different materials on the toxicity to HeLa cervical cancer cells. Magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared using a solventless thermal decomposition method and coated with either PLGA or CA-PLGA star copolymers. The uptake of nanoparticles by HeLa cells was observed by laser confocal microscopy. The toxicity to HeLa cells of Fe3O4 nanoparticles coated with these two materials was determined by the thiazole blue (MTT) method. The particle size of the single Fe3O4 nanoparticles was about 7 nm, and the PLGA and CA-PLGA nanoparticles loaded with Fe3O4 were spherical, with a particle size of about 200 mm and a theoretical drug loading of 10%. When the mass concentration of Fe3O4 nanoparticles is the same (25 pg/mL), the toxicity of Fe3O4-loaded CA-PLGA nanoparticles to HeLa cells is less than that of the corresponding PLGA nanoparticles. Thus, the CA-PLGA star copolymer can reduce the cytotoxicity of magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles and offers potential for broad application in vivo."
383,Effect of polyamide nanoparticles on apoptosis of colon cancer cells induced by survivin antisense oligonucleotide,2020-09-01,"In this study, we aimed to observe the effect of polyamidoamine (PAMAM) liposomes on the apoptosis of human colon cancer cells induced by survivin antisense oligonucleotides (ASODNs). PAMAM liposomes and PAMAM were mixed with survivin ASODNs to obtain antisense gene transfection complexes. In addition, the zeta potentials and encapsulation rates of the complexes were measured. The two gene-containing complexes were transfected into HT-29 colon cancer cells to observe changes in cell morphology, detect the inhibitory effect on tumor cells and changes in apoptosis, and observe changes in the cytoskeleton microfilament system using laser confocal microscopy. Caspase-3 activity in the cells was determined using a kinase activity assay, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) activity in the cells was measured using immunoprecipitation analysis. The results showed that the zeta potential of the PAMAM liposome-survivin-ASODN complex was higher than that of the PAMAM-survivin-ASODN complex (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the gene encapsulation rates between the two complexes (P > 0.05). PAMAM liposomes may efficiently deliver survivin ASODNs to human colon cancer cells, reduce the expression of survivin protein and at the same time induce G2/M phase arrest in cells, and activate caspase-3 by activating p38 MAPK. Cleavage of caspase-3 destroys the structure of the intracellular skeletal microfilament system, finally resulting in apoptosis of colon cancer cells."
384,Development of a sulphurous acid thiolysis-high performance liquid chromatography method for the analysis of procyanidins in pine bark products,2020-09-01,"A sulphurous acid thiolysis-HPLC method for the determination of procyanidins in pine bark products was established. The concentration of sulphurous acid is 1.2%, the concentration of benzyl mercaptan is 2%, the reaction temperature is 90 °C, and the reaction time is 60 minutes. Under these conditions, the preservative rates of catechin, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate and their benzyl sulfide derivatives were 89.7%, 86.2%, 95.4%, 63.1%, 64.6% and 73.5%, respectively. According to this study, the calculation method for the procyanidin content determination by the thiolysis-HPLC method was corrected."
385,Identification of prognostic and immune-related lncRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma based on the cancer genome atlas data mining,2020-08-01,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignancy originating from hepatocytes with a high rate of distant metastasis and recurrence. HCC prognosis remains poorly understood, although its diagnosis and treatment have improved globally. Therefore, it is necessary to identify reliable predictive and prognostic indicators of HCC. HCC gene expression profiles and corresponding clinical data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Seven lncRNAs (C10orf91, AC011352.3, AC015722.2, AC006372.1, PICSAR, AC110285.3, and AP001972.4) associated with immune and clinicopathological features were identified as biomarker candidates for HCC prognosis based on single-sample gene set enrichment analysis, the ESTIMATE algorithm, and Cox PHR analyses. Altogether, the findings revealed that the seven immune-related lncRNAs may provide a reference for improving HCC prognosis."
386,Encapsulating doxorubicin in PEGylation metal-organic frameworks for combined radiation therapy in liver cancer treatment,2020-08-01,"It is well known that nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (NMOFs) have exhibited brilliant advantages in cancer diagnosis and treatment due to their structural diversity, high intrinsic biodegradability, and drug-loading capacities. Herein, based on our previous results, hypoxia was suppressed by inhibiting the expression of the CA IX protein, produced from Zr-MOF nanoparticles, and enhancing radiation therapy (RT) effectiveness. We designed a nanocomposite by encapsulating doxorubicin into Zr-MOF nanoparticles. It is a highly effective drug for chemotherapy and MOF that can absorb X-rays well, applied to enhance RT as the radiosensitizer. PEG is used for surface modification in the nanoparticles and to improve circulation time by intravenous administration. These nanoparticles could be applied for RT combing with chemotherapy in vitro and vivo, obtaining excellent anticancer efficacy. Most importantly, [email protected] demonstrates high clearance from HepG2 tumor cells, reducing the circulation of toxicity in vivo. Our research exhibits a new approach to establishing [email protected] as a biodegradable drug-carrier system, containing chemotherapy drugs and functional elements that totally perform the diagnosis and treatment roles of RT."
387,Fabrication of gold nanoshells for improvement of cell apoptosis and its application in photothermal cancer therapy,2020-08-01,"For cancer diagnosis and therapeutics, we adopted a novel strategy and established a new approach by using transarterial administration of gold nanoshells on silica nanorattles (GSNs) for multifunctional biomedical application. The GSNs exhibit high biocompatibility and stability in vitro and in vivo. It was found that an arterial administration of GSNs showed six-fold higher efficiency than the venous method. In this study, we found that the system of using GSNs had a high near-infrared (NIR) absorbance and excellent photothermal transfer capability for cancer photothermal therapy (PTT) efficiently. More importantly, the GSN treatment method, involving interventional procedures and nanomaterials, showed great potential to promote tumor apoptosis in all research. Using CT imaging technology, we monitored the volume change of tumors and confirmed cell apoptosis by TUNEL staining and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, arterial administration of GSNs combined with NIR irradiation was established, and the related proteins was examined by Western blotting. Caspase-3 and 9 showed an high expression level within tumor tissues. Finally, a comparative study of biodistribution and safety was performed in vivo, and the biocompatibility was carefully evaluated. This GSN-based method was ultimately shown to be a promising approach for cancer therapy."
388,Study on the effect of superparamagnetic -FeO combined with carmustine on cervical cancer,2020-08-01,"This study aims to investigate the killing effect of γ-Fe2O3 combined with carmustine on cervical carcinoma cells, as well as the mechanism of drug resistance of this combined treatment. RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of Multidrug Resistance Gene (MDR-l) gene in all the samples. Results showed that the combination of γ-Fe2O3 and carmustine drugs was significantly better than the control group (P < 0.05), and the tumor showed different degrees of tolerance in combination with the drug. The results of an in vitro drug sensitivity test were consistent with those of mRNA expression of MDR-l gene (P < 0.04). The combination of superparamagnetic γ-Fe2O3 and carmustine derivatives has a better therapeutic effect on cervical carcinoma than either treatment alone. The drug sensitivity test and MDR-l mRNA detection in vitro can improve the accuracy and predictability of cervical carcinoma chemotherapy, providing a scientific basis for individual tumor chemotherapy."
389,Study on the antitumor activity and mechanism of novel targeted nanodrugs based on miRNA in cervical cancer,2020-08-01,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different concentrations of novel targeted nanodrugs based on miRNA on the antitumor activity and mechanism in cervical carcinoma A549 cells. The MTT method was used to determine the effect of different concentrations of novel targeted nanodrugs based on miRNA on A549 cell proliferation, and annexin V FITC/PI double staining flow cytometry was performed to analyze the effect of these nanodrugs on A549 cell apoptosis. Western blotting was performed to observe the effect of these nanodrugs on the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3-related genes involved in A549 cell apoptosis. Compared with the control group, the novel targeted nanodrugs based on miRNA significantly inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Results of double staining flow cytometry demonstrated that these nanodrugs could increase the apoptotic rate of A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner 48 h later. Western blotting revealed that these nanodrugs could upregulate the expression of Bax and caspase3 genes and downregulate the expression of Bcl-2 gene. Nanodrugs display an obvious antitumor activity in vitro, and the underlying mechanism may be associated with the upregulation of Bax and caspase-3 gene expression and the downregulation of Bcl-2 gene expression."
390,Preparation of a polymer-modified folate-targeted magnetic nano-delivery system and its inhibitory effect on nasopharyngeal carcinoma,2020-08-01,"The aims of this work were to investigate the effect of a polymer-modified folate-targeted magnetic nano-delivery system on growth inhibition of CNE2 cells and expression of Caspase-3 mRNA, and Caspase-3, Caspase-8, and Caspase-9 proteins, and to explore the mechanism used by this nano-delivery system to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. The MTT method was used to detect the effect of the polymer-modified folate-targeted magnetic nano-delivery system at different concentrations (0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00 g/mL) on CNE2 cell proliferation; the fluorescence PCR method was used to detect changes in Caspase-3 mRNA at different concentrations (0, 0.75, 1.00, 1.50 g/mL); and western blotting was used to detect Caspase-3, Caspase-8, and Caspase-9 expression. The polymer-modified folate-targeted magnetic nanoparticles inhibited the expression of Caspase-3 mRNA, and of Caspase-3, Caspase-8, and Caspase-9 in CNE2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. It may be concluded that the polymer-modified folate-targeted magnetic nano-delivery system can inhibit the growth of CNE2 cells and its effect is closely related to the upregulation of Caspase-3 mRNA and Caspase-3, Caspase-8, and Caspase-9 protein expression and initiation of the caspase cascade."
391,Effect of Ropivacaine nanoparticles on apoptosis of cerebral vascular endothelial cells,2020-08-01,"The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of Ropivacaine lactate glycolic acid copolymer nanoparticles on the apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells after cerebral vasospasm (CVS) in rabbits. Thirty New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into five groups: Sham Operation, control, blank nanoparticles, nanoparticles drug-loaded, and Ropivacaine. A model of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was established by injecting blood into the rabbits' cisterna magna twice. The mean velocity (VM) and peak systolic velocity (VP) of basilar artery were compared at one, three, and seven days, after which the shape was observed under a light microscope. The diameter of the lumen was measured at seven days after injection. The TUNEL method was used to detect the apoptosis of endothelial cells in the basilar artery. There was no obvious edema or blood clot and the basilar artery was clear in the Sham Operation group. In the control and blank nanoparticles groups, there was obvious swelling of brain tissue, and obvious blood clots were found at the bottom of brain, mostly around the basilar artery and Willis ring. The pool of brain bottom was dark red. Compared with the control and blank nanoparticles group, the swelling of brain tissue in the nanoparticles and Ropivacaine groups was reduced. Administration of Ropivacaine lactate glycolic acid copolymer nanoparticles into the epidural space of the upper thoracic segment in rabbits can reduce the apoptosis of CVS vascular endothelial cells after SAH."
392,S-(–)-equol alleviates stenosis of the injured carotid artery in Sprague Dawley rats by preventing the vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypic switch via inhibition of the MAPK-NFκB signaling,2020-08-01,"Phenotypic switching of the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is closely related to an in-stent restenosis (ISR). This study aimed to investigate whether S-(–)-equol prevented the phenotypic switch of the VSMCs as a potential treatment of an ISR. The carotid arteries of female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats with or without a carotid injury and ovariectomy were harvested after 4 weeks of treatment with S-(–)-equol. Stenosis of the carotid artery and two phenotype-related proteins-α smooth muscle actin (αSMA) and osteopontin (OPN)-were determined. The proliferation and migration capacities of VSMCs were determined by the CCK-8 and transwell assays, respectively. The expressions of αSMA, OPN, MAPKp38, p-MAPKp38, NF-κBp65, and p-NF-κBp65 were detected by a western blot. S-(–)-equol alleviated carotid stenosis and prevented the VSMC phenotypic switch in female SD rats with a carotid artery injury and a bilateral ovariectomy. S-(–)-equol inhibited the phenotypic switch of VSMCs, which was induced by PDGF-BB, and enhanced the proliferation and migration of VSMCs. The effects of S-(–)-equol on VSMCs were confirmed to be related to the inactivation of the GPER-MAPKp38-NF-κBp65 signaling in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that S-(–)-equol affects carotid stenosis by preventing the phenotypic switch of VSMCs via the GPER-MAPKp38-NF-κBp65 signaling pathway."
393,High precision electrolytic polishing of Ni–Ti shape memory alloy for biomedical vascular stents,2020-08-01,"There is a continuous demand for multi-disciplinary design approaches for the development of new implant materials. A potential biomaterial that is suitable for vascular stents and catheters is Ni–Ti alloy (Nitinol), which exhibits excellent biocompatibility, superelasticity, and shape memory effects. Corrosion resistance of Ni–Ti vascular stents in body fluids is significantly dependent on its surface finishing characteristics. In the study, as-drawn Ni–Ti wires were electropolished from a methanolic sulfuric acid electrolyte. The effect of various electropolishing (EP) parameters, i.e., current density, electropolishing time, and electrode gap, on the surface properties of Ni–Ti wires were examined. The surface morphology and topography of the Ni–Ti wires were characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The root mean square (R a) surface roughness of electropolished Ni–Ti wires was also measured using AFM. The results indicated that the surface finishing of Ni–Ti alloy exhibited maximum sensitivity to electropolishing current density. An optimum combination of surface morphology and roughness was obtained at a parameter set with current density of approximately 0.5 A/cm2, polishing time of 10 s, and electrode gap of 1.0 cm."

395,Nursing care of diabetic foot based on nanosilver antibacterial dressings,2020-08-01,"To investigate the control and prevention of diabetic foot infection with nano-silver antibacterial dressings and the difficulty of nursing. Sixty patients with diabetic foot, treated at our hospital between January 2017 to January 2018, were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups (n = 30 per group). Blood glucose was strictly controlled in both groups. After debridement, the ulcerated feet of the intervention and control groups were wrapped with nanosilver antibacterial and Vaseline dressings, respectively. The degree of pain and the severity and areas of ulcers were evaluated at the time of admission and after four weeks of treatment. The time required for ulcers to heal was assessed and the number of dressing changes were counted. The two groups were compared in terms of ease of care. Although treatment improved the Wagner grade in both groups, the improvement was significantly better in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, treatment reduced ulcerated areas in both groups, with significantly smaller ulcerated areas in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.05). The intervention group had significantly lower visual analog scores (VAS) than the control group (P < 0.05), although treatment lowered VAS in both groups. Ulcers healed significantly sooner and dressings were changed less frequently in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.05). The nursing difficulty of the intervention group was significantly lower than that of the control group. Nanosilver antibacterial dressings can promote healing, reduce ulcerated areas, improve Wagner classification, and reduce the frequency of dressing changes in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. At the same time, the use of nano-silver can reduce the difficulty of patient care."
396,The study on knee osteoarthritis in diabetic patients based on nanometric magnetic bead method,2020-08-01,"To study the levels of inflammatory cytokines in synovia fluid from osteoarthritis (OA) patients with/without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Out of 74 volunteers aged 20–88 years, 64 with knee OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grades over I) were recruited and divided into groups with (n = 20) and without (n = 44) diabetes. The nucleic acid of the patient tissue was extracted by nanometer magnetic bead method. The remaining participants were the control group (n = 10). Synovia fluid, sera, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were collected from all participants and analyzed using ELISA Kits. T2D-OA patients and OA patients had higher basal production of interleukin-1, (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and lower-level interleukin-10 (IL-10). However, there were no differences between T2D-OA and OA patients. IL-1, IL-10, and IL-6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after stimulation with LPS were obviously up-regulated in both patients and controls. The production of IL-1 and IL-6 in synovia from T2D-OA and OA patients increased as in the case of variations in sera and PBMCs. Both T2D-OA and OA patients had high-levels of IL-1 and IL-6 compared with controls, especially IL-6. The presence of IL-10 could not be detected in synovia from both patients and controls. Our results suggested that OA patient also had some pro-inflammatory factors in vivo, especially in local lesion; this manifest was particularly evident in T2D-OA patients. The high-level concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and low-level anti-inflammatory factors could be one of the reasons why T2D-OA patients are prone to developing synovitis."

A laser particle size analyzer (LPSA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), colorimetry, and UV-vis spectrophotometry were used to compare the differences in physicochemical properties such as particle size distribution, degree of cell breakage, fluidity and filling properties, color differences, solubility in water, total acid phenol, and flavone levels and antioxidant activities. Our results showed that the 200-mesh superfine DTP with the smaller particle size showed better performance in the tests, and may help to establish a foundation for research and development of dandelion tea."
398,Synthesis of an AgPO/AlPO composites for enhanced visible light-driven photocatalytic activity,2020-08-01,"Novel non-porous Ag3PO4/AlPO4 composites with a stick shape were synthesized using the homogeneous precipitation method and characterized by XRD, FESEM, XPS, UV-vis spectroscopy and BET method. The photocatalytic performance was evaluated by degradation of MB and MO upon irradiation with visible light. Results indicate that when the molar ratios of Ag3PO4 to AlPO4 are 6:4 or higher, remarkable increases in photocatalytic activity were observed compared with the pure Ag3PO4 powder. The possible mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of dyes by Ag3PO4/AlPO4 composites was proposed."
399,Influence of lattice oxygen on properties of Ce–Fe composite in NO+CO reduction system,2020-08-01,"Ce–Fe composite was prepared by hydrothermal method to simulate the ore facies with Ce–Fe coatingembedded structure in rare earth tailings. Fe2O3 is used as the carrier and cerium nitrate is used as active component. We studied the effect of lattice oxygen on the performance of Ce–Fe composites in the NO+CO reduction system. The results show that the peak of CeO2 in the sample prepared by the hydrothermal method of nitric acid moves at a high angle, the lattice constant becomes smaller, and the diffraction peak corresponding to CeO2 in Raman is red-shifted. It indicated that the hydrothermal method can form Ce–O–Fe solid solution. In TEM, nanoscale Fe2O3 particles caused by the decomposition of ferric nitrate were observed on the surface of the sample. In the whole reaction process, a large amount of lattice oxygen provided by Fe2O3 as a carrier, the presence of Ce–O–Fe solid solution and free Fe2O3 fine particles determine the high catalytic activity of the composite catalyst. The presence of CeO2 can improve the surface reduction of Fe2O3, and also promote the conversion of Fe3+ to Fe2+, Ce4+ to Ce3+. The conversion of lattice oxygen to adsorbed oxygen reflects the combined action of the composite catalysts Ce and Fe. The denitration rate of the Ce–Fe composite NO+CO reduction system exceeded 92.24% at 700 °C. Lattice oxygen can promote the performance of Ce–Fe composites in NO+CO reduction system."
400,"Preparation and analysis of electrochromic properties of poly(3,4 ethylene dioxythiophene)",2020-08-01,"The film of PEDOT was prepared in this study via electrochemical polymerization using EDOT as monomer in LiClO4/PC solution. The effects on the properties of the film were surveyed including the deposition voltage and deposition time. The morphology of the film was observed by scanning electron microscopy. The electrochromic kinetics was analyzed by combination of electrochemical workstation and UV-Visible spectrophotometer such as the transmittance, transmittance contrast, coloring efficiency and the response time. The results indicated the film presents a coral shape despites of the deposition voltage and the deposition time. In case of the application as electrochromic film, the optimal process condition is 1.3 V and 24 s. The corresponding transmittance is 82.77% in fade state. The transmittance contrast is 17.87%, and the coloring efficiency is about 117.92 cm2/C, the response time is 0.52 s."
401,Polypyrrole and  nanowires grown on graphene foam for asymmetric supercapacitor,2020-08-01,"The asymmetric supercapacitor with negative electrode by graphene foam loaded Polypyrrole nanowires (PPy NWs/rGOF) and positive electrode by [email protected]2 core–shell nanowires on graphene foam ([email protected]2 NWs/rGOF) was developed. The negative electrode was further converted into the positive electrode by one-step redox reaction at room temperature. Graphene foam (rGOF) with unique flexibility, large surface area and high electric conductivity can favor in situ growth of polypyrrole nanowires (PPy NWs) as well as improve cycling stability of the resultant negative electrode. PPy NWs served as the ideal template for the formation of MnO2 shell gives rise to the as-prepared positive electrode with fast electron transport and enhanced active material utilization. Owing to the rational design, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor was able to be repeatedly discharged/charged at 1.6 V, displaying high energy density of 1.04 mWh cm–3 with improved cycling stability."
402,Interface debonding performance of precast segmental nano-materials based concrete (PSNBC) beams,2020-08-01,"The precast segmental concrete (PSC) structures and the nano-materials based concrete beams are widely applied to civil engineering. On the other hand, it is well known that nano-materials have physical effects and can significantly improve the concrete properties of cement-based materials. Therefore, the interface debonding performance of precast segmental nano-materials based concrete (PSNBC) beams is investigated in this study. Two concrete specimens with nano-materials and one concrete specimen without nano-materials were prepared and bonded into PSC beams with a high strength epoxy adhesive. The smart aggregates (SAs) made of piezoceramic Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) and concrete are used as the intelligent transducer of monitoring test specimen. The PSC beam was loaded periodically by screw jack to simulate the random debonding damage of different degrees. The experimental results show that the interface debonding performance of the concrete specimens with nano-materials is significantly enhanced and better than that of concrete specimens without nano-materials."
403,Microwave absorption performance of barium hexaferrite multi-nanolayers,2020-08-01,"In this work, the microwave absorption performance of barium hexaferrite multi-nanolayers synthesized by aceramic method was investigated. The microwave absorption performances of BaFe12O19 and BaCoZnFe10O19 multi-nanolayers with thicknesses of 25, 50, 75, 100, 200, 300, 500, and 1000 nm were evaluated using a vector network analyser (VNA) at room temperature to characterize the reflected signal (S 11) and transmitted signal (S 21) in the frequency range of 7–13 GHz. The microwave absorption performance of the multilayer structure was enhanced due to the combination of nanolayers.

405,Fabrication of a superhydrophobic surface by a template-assisted chemical deposition method,2020-08-01,"A novel chemical deposition method was developed to fabricate an appealing micro-nanostructure on an iron sheet with the assistance of a candle soot coating that served as the surface template. The process is only three steps. First, a soot coating was deposited on a iron sheet surface by placing the iron sheet over the flame of a burned candle. Secondly, the iron sheet was immersed in a copper dichloride ethanol solution for 0.5 hours to obtain a copper layer with a rough three-level structure consisted of microprotrusions, submicron-scale papillae and nanosheets. Thirdly, the prepared iron sheet was modified with octadecanoic acid. It was indicated that the resulting rough copper surface on the iron sheet had great superhydrophobicity whose water contact and sliding angles reach 156.9° and 4.6°, respectively. Here, a new approach may be developed for design and fabrication of ideal hierarchical surface structures via chemical deposition."
406,Analysis of corrosion resistance of lightweight aluminum alloy sheet in the friction-stir joint area,2020-08-01,"In this thesis, 1 mm thick 6061 aluminum alloy plates are connected using a friction stir joining device, and the metallographic structure and corrosion resistance of the friction stir joint area obtained with different process parameters are systematically analyzed. The results show that the core region of the joint is composed of small equiaxed crystals, and the grains in the heat-affected zone are elongated in the direction of stirring flow. The grain sizes of the heat-affected zone is different, and it is a coexistence zone of grains of various sizes. When the rotation speed of the stirring head is 15000 rpm and the forward speed of the stirring head is 300 mm/min, the self-corrosive potential of the connection area is optimized during electrochemical corrosion, and thus the self-corrosion current is the smallest. With this parameter, the joint area has the best corrosion resistance."

Serious adverse reactions were not found in both the groups. Ranitidine combined with omeprazole is effective and safe in the treatment of peptic ulcers and worthy of clinical application."
410,Environment-sensitive hydrogels as potential drug delivery systems for the treatment of periodontitis,2020-07-01,"Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease caused by pathogenic microorganisms colonized in periodontal pocket. The disease leading to the destruction of periodontal tissues including gums, periodontal ligaments, dental cementum and alveolar bone has been regarded as a latent risk factor of other medical problems. The therapeutic effects of periodontitis are unsatisfactory currently, though a great many strategies have been used to enhance the results of its treatments.

411,Analysis on sliding wear behavior of Al + BC+ mica hybrid metal matrix composites,2020-07-01,"In this investigation, wear behavior of hybrid aluminum metal matrix composites (HMMCs) fabricated by stir casting technique is carried out. Boron carbide and Mica particles are added. The Mica percentage varies from 3–5% in steps of 1% with a constant reinforcement quantity of 10% boron carbide. The dry sliding wear experiments are explored on a pin on disc tribometer. The process variables considered for the study are: Mica mass fraction, sliding speed, load and sliding time, and the response analyzed is wear loss. Box-Behnken design is used for conducting the experiments. The result shown proves that 3% of Mica particle inclusion reduces the wear due to the increase in density. Further increase of mica does not improve the wear resistance. ANOVA results indicate that load and % of Mica are the profoundly influencing parameters. The pin surface is analyzed by using a Scanning Electron Microscope."
412,High photoresponsivity and external quantum efficiency of ultraviolet photodetection by mechanically exfoliated planar multi-layered graphene oxide sheet prepared using modified Hummer's method and spin coating technique,2020-07-01,"Electron–hole (e–h) pair generation and conversion into photocurrents by two-dimensional (2D) nanoparticle based metal semiconductor metal (MSM) structured photodetector is crucial for the development self-powered and high performance photodetectors. In this regard, graphene oxide (GO) is a highly suitable photoconducting material alongside graphene and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). A modified Hummer's method is applied to obtain the GO supernatant which undergoes morphological, structural and vibrational characterizations. The D and G bands observed at 1347 and 1592 cm–1 from the spectral analysis are due to the A 1g symmetry sp 3 carbon (C) and E 2g phonons by sp 2 C respectively, confirming the formation of GO. Electron beam evaporation is carried out to fabricate the silver (Ag) source and drain electrode fringes with 300 nm separation for current– voltage characterization. Non-linear and non-rectifying behavior is observed on the MSM structured multilayer GO film. The ideality factor and barrier height, calculated from the thermionic emission model at the Schottky junction of source is found to be lower than that of the drain. The mechanically exfoliated GO onto the Ag electrodes enables a high photoresponsivity and external quantum efficiency (EQE) about 4.12 AW–1 and 1346% to be attained. This shows that GO can behave as either a  p- or n-type semiconducting materials."
413,Effect of prior cold ring rolling on carbide dissolution during the austenitizing process of an M50 bearing steel,2020-07-01,"The influence of prior cold ring rolling (PCRR) on carbide dissolution during the austenitizing process of an M50 bearing steel was investigated by combining microstructural observations with kinetics analysis. The microstructural results show that the PCRR leads to a reduction in the volume fraction and the mean diameter of the undissolved carbides. The matrix of the as-quenched specimens after PCRR is enriched with more carbon and alloying elements than those without PCRR, which further confirms that the dissolution behavior of the alloy carbides is enhanced by PCRR during the austenitizing process. The kinetics of the transformation from ferrite to austenite (α → γ) without and with PCRR are determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) upon heating. The austenite onset (Ac1) and end (Ac3) temperatures both decrease with as the thickness reduction from the PCRR increases. The activation energy for the α → γ transformation is calculated and shows a significant decline when the PCRR process is applied. In addition, the PCRR process results in a slight increase in the hardness regardless of the austenitizing temperature."
414,Processing of high strength Mg–9Gd–3Nd–1Sn–1Zn–0.6Zr alloy by hot rolling and subsequent aging,2020-07-01,"Magnesium alloy plates can be strengthened by rolling, however, it is easy to crack or even break when the reduction of Mg–RE alloys is too large. Herein, the strengthening mechanical of the Mg–9Gd–3Nd–1Sn–1Zn– 0.6Zr alloy under different treatment conditions were investigated after hot-rolling to 80% reduction in thickness (0.8 mm) by multi-step methods. Furthermore, the rolled alloy by aging strengthening are explored. The results show that the hot-rolled alloy with 80% reduction are basically composed of dynamically recrystallized grains with the size of about 60 m, improving the mechanical properties significantly. The precipitates within grains undergo SSSS→ β″ → β′ phase transformation with the aging treatment up to 200 °C. Fine β″ precipitates were found in the grains of the rolled alloy under aged time (2 h), while β″ precipitates changed into β′ phase when the aging time was extended to 32 h. The base phase which is perpendicular to phase was precipitated in the alloy in longer aging time (96 h). In addition, the thickness of precipitates and precipitation-free zone (PFZ) at the grain boundary gradually increased as the time went on. Meanwhile, the discontinuous equilibrium phases at the grain boundary are gradually become continuous. The ultimate tensile strength and hardness were reached to 431.14 MPa, 105.9 HV at peak-aging, in addition, the elongation is reached to 3.11%, respectively. The formation of crack sources is due to the stress concentration between the brittle PFZ and the magnesium matrix, which leads to the decrease of ductility."
415,Effect of shot peening on very high cycle fatigue of 2024-T351 aluminium alloy,2020-07-01,"To investigate the influence of shot peening (SP) on very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) performance of 2024-T351, the specimens with three surface conditions were performed under ultrasonic fatigue tests: mechanicallypolished without peening (NP), ceramic shot peening (SP1), steel and glass mixed shot peening (SP2). The roughness, microhardness, residual stress, fractography measurement and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were applied before fatigue test to characterize the effective layer induced by the peening treatment. For the failed specimens, the fracture surface were analysed using SEM to study the mechanisms of fatigue crack propagation. In addition, the fatigue life curve in ultra-high cycle region continuously decreased in the three series of specimens. However, the experimental results revealed that fatigue strength improvement resulting from shot peening treatment was negligible in very high cycle regime. Furthermore, the stress intensity factor for the surface crack initiation (SCI) and interior crack initiation (ICI) was discussed based on quantitative analysis on the fracture surface. The average values of ΔKfish-eye for NP, SP1 and SP2 specimens are about 2.22, 1.48 and 1.61 MPa · m1/2, respectively."
416,Study on the rule of blister formation and identification technology of multi-cores copper wires in fire,2020-07-01,"The common presence of the wire blisters in fire indicates that the wire was exposed to fire. Yet current overload happening before fire also causes some wire blisters. Most trace evidences on the wire from fire are required to examine melted blisters marks of the wire. Thus, it is critical to clearly identify and determine the differences between blisters merely exposure to fire and current overload for fire investigators. Two fire scenarios, fire heating and overcurrent, and 2.5 mm2 multi-cores copper wires were selected by this paper to make blisters. Then, the identification technology of blisters was studied. The experimental results suggested that the external appearance and metallographic structure taken on by blisters were not the precise evidences to identify whether blisters are merely exposed to fire or overcurrent. Therefore, the metallographical method of polarized light was used to analyse Cu2O content in blisters. Besides, such content was used to accurately identify two kinds of blisters. The content of Cu2O of the overcurrent blisters was larger than that of the fire heating blisters notably."

Under the experimental conditions with the deformation temperatures of 950–1050 °C, strain rates of 0.01–1 s–1, pass strains of 0.1–0.2 and inter-pass time of 1–100 s, respectively. The influence of various processing parameters on the static softening were discussed seriously and the results showed that the softening fractions raise quickly with the deformation temperature, the strain rate, the pass strain and the inter-pass time; Oppositely, it is reduced as the initial austenite grain size raises. In addition, the kinetic equations have been adopted and the required parameters have been determined based on the experiments, the calculated results are consistent with the experimental results, indicating the SRX behavior and microstructural evolutions of Ti–V microalloyed steel could be estimated by the determined kinetics parameters."

The optimal growth conditions of the genetically-modified rBMSCs in the scaffolds were established, and the effects of tissue engineering materials and PRP gel construction on the osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs were assessed. The results revealed that high-purity rBMSCs were obtained, and high levels of BMP-2 and PDGF-BB were secreted by the transduced cells. Furthermore, PRP promoted the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs overexpressing PDGF-BB and BMP-2. Collectively, the results of the present study revealed that genetically modified rBMSCs incorporated into PRP gels enhanced osteogenic differentiation."

Short aging treatment was given to the specimen prior to the wear tests. The density and the hardness of the 3D printed maraging steel were found to be better than the homogenized-aged 18Ni1900 maraging steel. The wear resistance is an important aspect that influences the functionality of the components. The wear tests in dry condition were performed on maraging steel on pin/disc standard wear testing machine. The design of experiments was planned and executed based on response surface methodology. This technique is employed to investigate three influencing and controlling constraints namely speed, load, and distance of sliding. It has been observed that sliding speed and normal load significantly affects the wear of the specimen. The statistical optimization confirms that the normal load, sliding distance, and speed are significant for reducing the wear rate. The confirmation test was conducted with a 95% confidence interval using optimal parameters for validation of wear test results. A mathematical model was developed to estimate the wear rate. The experimental results were matched with the projected values. The wear test parameters for minimum and maximum wear rate have been determined."

423,Defect-related luminescent microstructured hydroxyapatite promote bone regeneration through nucleating effect,2020-07-01,"Non-nano scaled hydroxyapatite (HAP) particles cannot enter the cells, but they are also wildly used in tissue engineering for their excellent bone regeneration. We synthesized a defect-related luminescent micro-scale hydroxyapatite particles (S3) and investigated the effect of S3 during bone regeneration. S3 promoted the formation of mineralized nodules and collagen synthesis of osteoblasts (OBs). Micro-scaled S3 couldn't enter into OBs and couldn't change the Ca2+ concentration of the medium. During the cell differentiation, the location of S3 was tracked by its defect-related luminescence in vitro. Extracellular S3 particles become the nucleation events which promote bone regeneration. The results suggest that micro-scale HAP promoted bone regeneration through extracellular pathways. This result also can explain the reason why hydroxyapatite covered tissue scaffold is more suitable for bone reconstructing."

Therefore, it is necessary to optimize DS processing parameters to control its properties. This work is aimed at studying the effect rule of DS processing parameters on microstructure of ZL114A alloy. The specimens of this alloy were prepared using high-vacuum DS equipment. In the process of DS, temperatures change from 700 °C to 800 °C, and pulling rates increase from 100 μm/s to 200 m/s. Microstructure of specimens was investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Mechanical properties of specimens were measured by means of universal tension tester and microhardness tester. Effects of melt temperatures and pulling rates on the microstructures and mechanical properties were studied and discussed. Experimental results show that the microstructure can be improved with the decrease in melting temperatures and the increase in pulling rates. However, the microstructure became coarser when the pulling rate is too higher. Therefore, a set of processing parameters were optimized as melting temperature of 700 °C and pulling rate of 150 μm/s to improve the microstructure of ZL114A alloy."

427,The impact of synthesis techniques on the properties of hybrid perovskite materials for photovoltaic application,2020-07-01,"Hybrid perovskites are organometal halide materials that are attractive to the researchers owing to impressive physical properties like absorption coefficients. Controlled formation of perovskite crystal during the preparation process is key to achieving better morphological features, thereby influencing the material's properties. In this paper, we examined the impact of two synthesis techniques as well as new material composition on the properties of the perovskite materials. These perovskite materials were produced by one- and two-step solution processes and the kinetics of the composition of perovskite were characterized by the following techniques: UV-vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Thermo gravimetric analysis. The electrochemical properties were examined by cyclic voltammetry using the two-electrode system. All samples exhibited an absorption onset around 850 nm which corresponded well with the energy gap (∼1.55 eV). The two-step process resulted in smooth XRD patterns, hence exhibiting improved crystallinity owing to sharper peaks than those from one-step process. The sample crystallite sizes ranged of 44–81 nm. We conclude that two synthesis techniques together with new materials composition showed better thermal stability compared with previous reports. Cyclic voltammetry indicated that the perovskite electrodes exhibited stable electrochemical performance and easy charge transfer during the reaction. Our results suggest better electrochemical properties with possible capacitance which is beneficial for energy storage devices."

However, cheap House-EBN is usually masqueraded as expensive Cave-EBN for profiteering. Efficient scientific means are required to trace Cave-EBN. After microwave digestion of EBN lyophilizing powder, its mineral element compositions were examined by using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Influences of two key factors, production environment and country, on the distribution of 21 elements were analyzed. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) coupled with leave-one out cross validation was applied for modeling. Classifier generalization performance was assessed by the Confusion Matrix approach. ICP-MS identified the presence of 21 macro and micro elements with contributions of 99.65% and 0.35%, respectively. A two-way ANOVA established that B, Na, K, Ca, Mn, Cu, Sr, and Cd were the production-environment-specific elements. Among four different combinations based on three potential variables (Ca, Na, and Sr), Na/Ca was identified as the best among them having 100% specificity on tracing Cave-EBN. In conclusion, EBN was a good mineral element source. The methodology of integration of ICP-MS with chemo-metrics proved to be a powerful tool for tracing Cave-EBN."
430,Study on the function of self-polymerizing peptide nanofiber material combined with nerve growth factor-mediated RNA repair for nerve injury treatment in rabbits with the osteofascial compartment syndrome,2020-07-01,"The present study aimed to establish an animal model of the osteofascial compartment syndrome (OFCS) in hind legs of rabbits, and to repair an early nerve injury using the self-polymerized peptide nanofiber material that was laced with nerve growth factors (NGFs). An animal model of the compartment syndrome was established using the tourniquet method. The intrafascial pressure of rabbit legs at different time points was measured after successful modeling. Western blotting was used to assess the proliferation of nerve cells after injury. After incision and decompression, the repair group was implanted with the self-polymerized peptide nanofiber material in combination with NGFs at the nerve injury sites for repair of the injured nerves. Rabbit hind leg nerve specimens were collected from experimental rabbits (control group), rabbits 5 days after injury (unrepaired group), and rabbits 5 days after injury (repaired group), and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining analysis and immunofluorescence experiments were also performed. After loosening the tourniquet, the intra-fascial pressure peaked on the 1st day after injury and then gradually decreased. A western blot showed low expression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigens (PCNAs) in the control group, as it began to increase 4 h after injury, peaked 5 days after injury (P < 0.05), and then gradually decreased. Meanwhile, the tissue morphology of the repair group was better than that of the non-repair group. Fluorescence double labeling results showed that the proliferation of nerve cells in the repair group increased significantly, and S100 and DAPI co-labeling intensities increased significantly. The early application of the self-polymerizing peptide nanofiber material combined with NGF exhibited evident effects on the nerve injury treatment in the osteofascial compartment syndrome."
431,The forming and crystallization behaviors of ZrTiCuNiAl bulk amorphous alloy by laser additive manufacturing,2020-07-01,"Due to the small size and serious crystallization, the wider application of amorphous alloy materials is limited. In this paper, the bulk amorphous alloy with the size of 15 mm × 15 mm × 12 mm was made by selective laser melting technology. The characters of the composition and structure of the as-prepared bulk amorphous alloy and the thermal effect of the preparation process were analyzed. The results showed that the cooling rate of both the molten pool and the heat affected zone were much higher than the critical cooling rate of the amorphous alloy and, therefore, the cooling rate was not the reason for the crystallization in this experiment. The molten pool of the formed amorphous alloy block was completely amorphous. Due to the accumulation of structural relaxation, crystallization occurred in the heat affected zone, but the amorphous structure was still dominant. The increase in deposition layer had no obvious effect on crystallization."

Similarly, inflammatory nodules, lymphomas, and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinomas were identified using ultrasound. Lymphoepithelial carcinomas were often observed in the parotid glands, with hypoechoic nodules. Network-like or cord-like hyperechoes were often observed in the nodules, with unclear boundaries, irregular morphologies, and significantly less invasion into the surrounding tissues. Differences in the incidence in the right and left glands, blood flow signal, nerve invasion, lymphatic metastasis, and tumor volume were insignificant. Lymphatic metastasis was often noted in ipsilateral neck level II, followed by the periparotid region or ipsilateral neck level I. The diagnoses of inflammatory nodules and lymphomas had a combined pathology, while the diagnosis of nasopharynx cancer was dependent on the result of nasopharyngoscopy. The ultrasonic features of lymphoepithelial carcinomas of the salivary gland are network-like or cord-like hypoechoic nodules that possess the ultrasonic and biological features of malignant tumors."
433,Evaluation of low molecular weight polyethylenimine-introduced chitosan for gene delivery to mesenchymal stem cells,2020-07-01,"This study aimed to examine the transfection ability of polyethylenimine (PEI) (1800 Da)-grafted chitosan (10 kDa) (CP), a newly synthesized PEI derivative, in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The safety evaluation of the complex/DNA was studied in vitro and in vivo. In addition, CP/pGL3 was applied to investigate the effects of transfection efficiency. In this study, CP/DNA can be formed with compatible physicochemical characteristics for gene delivery. CP cytotoxicity decreased in A549 cells. Moreover, a zebrafish embryo model was used for evaluating the safety in vivo. Compared to the PEI (25 kDa) group, the zebrafish hatching rate increased and the mortality rate decreased in the CP/DNA group, which provided an indication of the safety of CP. In comparison with chitosan (100 kDa)-PEI (1200 Da), CP's transfection efficiency was higher in both A549 cells and MSCs. This study aimed to lay the foundation for further applications of CP in gene delivery. Therefore, further gene therapy investigations of CP by using MSCs need to be performed."
434,Fluorescence quenching of methanol-soluble polypyrimidine by aluminum ion,2020-07-01,"The different proportion methylpyrimidine ring copolymers has been synthesized and characterized by 1HNMR, 13CNMR and FT-IR spectrum. The detection limit of P80 for Al3+ ions of 7.94 × 10–8 M at the dichloromethane solution. The binding constant (Kb ) between copolymers and with Al3+ was 1.10 × 104 M–1. The EDS analysis and XPS spectroscopy can expose that the copolymer and Al3+ had been coordination with each other. The neutral polymers with good recovery properties can be used as sensor detect Al3+ in the organic solvent. The methanol-soluble polymer has been synthesized from methylpyrimidine ring copolymers, and investigated acidochromic properties and found that the acidochromic property of the polymer was retained after quaternization, but cannot detect Al3+ in the methanol (MeOH). The methanol-soluble polymers using environment-friendly solvents such as methanol can be used in detect H+ in the methanol."
435,Nano-titanium dioxide/basic magnesium hypochlorite-containing linear low-density polyethylene composite film on food packaging application,2020-06-01,"The aim of this research was to probe the potential application of nano-titanium dioxide (TiO2)/basic magnesium hypochlorite (BMH)-containing linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) composite film in grape fresh-keeping. Mechanical properties, transparency, barrier performance and antibacterial activity of the nano-composite membrane were measured, and results showed that the antibacterial zone diameter of TiO2/BMH on pathogen-Aspergillus niger was 31.4 mm, with mixing ratio of BMH/TiO2 to 2:1. It was clearly shown that the synthesized nano-composite films decreased mechanical properties and transparency of the membrane, and also had a significant impact on sensory score, mass loss rate, decay rate, ascorbic acid (Vc) content and titratable acid content compared with LLDPE films. Moreover, the results revealed that the LLDPE antibacterial film can be effectively used for storing grapes, preserving the flavor of grapes and had an obviously effect in prolonging grapes’ shelf life."
436,Investigation on dynamic holographic display in liquid crystal film doped with carbon dots,2020-06-01,"In this paper, we studied the holographic properties of liquid crystal (LC) thin film doped with carbon dots (CDs) which can be used as real-time holographic display screen. The maximum value of diffraction efficiency can reach up to 30% by using a low applied electric field 0.2 V/μm. Holograms in the LC film can be dynamically formed and self-erased. The hologram build-up time and the hologram self-erasure time in the material is fast enough to realize video refresh rate. In addition, the forming process of hologram was studied. The holographic diffraction efficiency was measured depending on the intensity of recording light, applied electric field, the intensity of readout light, and readout light polarization direction. Triple enhancement of the diffraction efficiency value by the modulation of voltage under the condition of low recording energy is presented. Therefore, we develop an easy way to obtain real-time dynamic holographic red, green and blue displays with high diffraction efficiency, which allow the LC film doped with CDs to be used as a holographic 3D display screen."

438,Electrical properties of Ga-doped ZnO nanowires/Si heterojunction diode,2020-06-01,"Herein, we report the high-temperature electrical characteristics of heterojunction diode fabricated based on n-Ga-doped ZnO nanowires/p-Silicon substrate. Various electronic properties such as rectification ratio, the effective barrier height, the diode ideality factor, etc. of the fabricated heterojunction diode at high temperature were investigated. The electrical characteristics were examined in the high-temperature range of 293 K–433 K in both reverse and forward biased conditions, which exhibited good stability over the entire temperature range. The observed current–voltage (I–V) studies confirmed three different conduction mechanisms for the fabricated heterojunction diodes, i.e., either field emission or tunneling, recombination-tunneling mechanism and the transport mechanism dominated by space-charge-limited current at the different regions. The observed electrical results exhibited fluctuations in the sensitivity of the quality factor of the heterojunction diode and consequently corresponding fluctuations in the resistance. The linear dependence of effective barrier height on quality factor can be attributed to the presence of some lateral inhomogeneities in the barrier height. The analysis of C–V data was conducted to deduce the value of barrier height of Schottky barrier for the fabricated heterojunction diode. Interestingly, the observed results assert the mismatch that occurs between the interface states and resulting capacitance of the fabricated heterojunction diode."
439,Regulation of intestinal lipid metabolism by fusion-induced fatty liver based on graphene oxide nanopore DNA,2020-06-01,"The regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism by intestinal microorganisms is closely related to the occurrence of fatty liver. In order to explore the relationship between the distribution of intestinal flora and the occurrence of fatty liver, we extracted fecal DNA from normal people (group C) and patients with fatty liver (group D), sequenced the collected samples with graphene oxide (GO) nano-solid nanopore, and sequenced the V3 and V4 regions of 16S. After screening the sequencing data, all tag sequences of all samples were clustered according to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using UPARSE 9 software. After determining abundance of OTUs and species annotation of the sequencing results, alpha diversity was analyzed based on an OTU abundance table. Krona (V2.6) 18 software displayed the results of species annotation in an interactive and visual way, and species distribution among groups was compared. The LEfSe method was used to analyze the differences of species distribution among components. After cluster analysis, the number of OTUs in the normal population was 512, the number of intestinal species in fatty liver patients was 541, of which 262 were common species. Alpha diversity analysis revealed reduced relative abundance in the fatty liver patients. The abundance of phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species in each group were compared. The abundance of Pachytene and Proteus increased abnormally and the relative abundance of Clostridium decreased. In addition, the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae in Enterobacteriaceae and Fusobacteria in Fusobacteria decreased. The relative abundance of Bacteroidea, Bacteroideae, and Lachnospiraceae increased. The results of species distribution analysis confirmed that the difference of Fusicantibacter distribution in Lachnospiraceae was significant. Functional analysis of the distribution of the flora revealed the principle role of the flora in fat metabolism. Therefore, it was concluded that Fusicantibacter was the dominant flora in patients with fatty liver, which promoted the formation of fatty liver by enhancing fat metabolism. The findings also demonstrated that GO nanopores can be used for DNA sequencing."
440,Effects of Cu on mechanical properties and corrosion resistance on (TiZrNiBe)Cu alloys,2020-06-01,"Due to high strength, perfect plasticity and higher hardness, bulk metallic glass (BMG) has been widely concerned. The work used the vaccum casting of copper-formed mold to establish (Ti36.1Zr33.2Ni5.8Be24.9)100-x Cu x , where x = 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11. Thermal properties, mechanical behaviors of compression, and corrosion resistance in the proposed compounds were investigated. The results show that the increase in Cu content enhances the heat resistance and the forming of glass of BMGs, small amount of fine dendritic crystals presents in BMG when x = 3, and the best corrosion resistance and mechanical properties can be obtained when x = 7, the yield strength, fracture strength and plastic strain can reach 1496.15 MPa, 2003.44 MPa and 19.19%, respectively."
441,Solution combustion synthesis of mesoporous mesh-structured CoO/C composites as anode materials for lithium storage,2020-06-01,"A mesoporous mesh Co3O4/C composite was synthesized by using a combustion synthesis (SCS) method with mixed fuel solution. The combustion reactivity can be controlled through adjusting the fuel composition. During combustion reaction, with the release of gas and the growth of Co3O4 particles, residual carbon and Co3O4 formed porous network that significantly improved the rate performance of the Co3O4/C composite. After 200 cycles, the Co3O4/C composite delivered reversible discharge/charge specific capacity of 1120/1025, 965/930, 889/837, and 772/706 mAh g-1 at current densities of 1 C, 2 C, 3 C, and 5 C, respectively.

442,Characteristics of W thin film deposited by indirect inductively coupled plasma assisted sputtering,2020-06-01,"Tungsten (W) has a short electron mean free path (EMFP) of 19 nm and a high melting point (3673 K), and, therefore, is being actively studied as one of the next generation thin interconnector materials replacing Cu. In this study, DC magnetron sputtering of W thin film assisted by indirect inductively coupled plasma (ICP) (where, the ICP is located near the substrate) has been investigated for the deposition of 20 nm thick W thin films with a low resistivity and the results were compared with those deposited by direct ICP assisted DC magnetron (where, the ICP is located near the DC magnetron). The W thin films deposited with the indirect ICP assisted sputtering showed the continuous decrease of the W resistivity from 76.5 (0 W) to 22.2 (500 W) Ohm-cm with the increase of ICP power. In the case of W thin film deposited with direct ICP assisted sputtering, even though the resistivity was initially decreased with the ICP power, the resistivity was increased at high ICP powers due to the increased W surface roughness. The lower W resistivity at high ICP powers for the indirect ICP assisted DC sputtering was related to the change of crystal structure to BCC from A-15 and lower oxygen content in the film due to the higher ion flux to the substrate without increasing the surface roughness."
443,Etch characteristics of nanoscale ultra low-k dielectric using CHF,2020-06-01,"Next generation semiconductor devices require ultra low dielectric constant (ULK) materials such as porous SiCOH on the back end of line structure for lower resistance and capacitance (RC) time delay, however, these ULK materials are easily damaged by the exposure to plasmas during the etching. In this study, etch characteristics of nanoscale TiN masked porous SiCOH such as etch rate, etch profile, surface damage, etc. and plasma characteristics by using C3H2F6 based gases have been investigated with a dual-frequency capacitively coupled plasma system (DF-CCP) and the results were compared with those by using conventional C4F8 based gases used for low-k dielectric etching. The results showed that, for the similar etch rates and etch profiles of porous SiCOH, lower sidewall damage was observed for the etching with the C3H2F6 compared to the C4F8. The analysis showed that it was related to less UV (less than 400 nm) emission and less fluorine radicals in the plasma for C3 H2F6 compared to C4F8, which leads to less fluorine diffusion to the sidewall surface of the etched porous SiCOH by the fluorine scavenging by hydrogen in C3H2F6."
444,Microstructure and mechanical properties of low temperature carburizing layer on AISI 440C martensitic stainless steel,2020-06-01,"In this study, the microstructure and mechanical properties of AISI 440C martensitic stainless steel with low temperature carburizing (LTC) layers were investigated by microscopes, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Vickers indenter and pin-on-disc test device, etc. LTC treatment was conducted at 420 °C for 10–40 h on the quenched-tempered steel samples by pack method. Results indicated that the LTC layers formed on base metal exhibited compact and regular morphology, and carbon-expanded martensite (α′c), Fe3C and Cr23C6 compounds were examined in the LTC layers by XRD analysis. Besides, the layer hardness from 1430 to 1720 HV0.025 with processing time increased, which was approximately three times higher than that of the specimen without LTC treatment. However, as the processing time increased, the adhesion strength of LTC layers deteriorated and the indentation grade decreased from HF1 to HF3. In addition, the wear resistance was significantly improved after the LTC treatment, and the wear rate of the LTC layer decreased by 93.7% in comparison with the untreated condition."
445,Microspheres scar formation glaucoma filtration surgery area therapeutic effect—Based on rapamycin-chitosan-calcium alginate sustained-release,2020-06-01,"To study the efficacy of rapamycin (RAPA)-chitosan (CS)-calcium alginate (CA) sustained-release microspheres on scar formation in a rabbit model of glaucoma filtration surgery. Eighty New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into four groups and a glaucoma filtration model was established by scleral bite through the eyes. RAPA-CS-CA sustained-release microspheres were implanted in the right eye of 40 rabbits (Group A) and CS blank sustained-release microspheres were implanted in the left eye (Group B). Another 40 rabbits were treated with a 0.2 g·L-1 RAPA cotton sheet in the right eye (Group C) and the left eye underwent a simple sclerotomy (Group D). The intraocular pressure, filter bleb, anterior chamber inflammation, complications, and corneal endothelial cell density were observed after the operation. Rabbits were euthanized for pathological examination 7 days, 14 days, and 21 days after the operation. The drug loading rate of RAPA-CS-CA sustainedrelease microspheres was (34.58±1.47)% and the encapsulation rate was (56.23±1.55)%. The microsphere release in vitro was relatively stable. The release rate of the microspheres during the burst was only 16.54%. After 49 days, the cumulative release rate of the microspheres reached 94.07% and the sustained release effect was significant within 45 days. Group A maintained low-level intraocular pressure for the longest period of time, followed by Group C, and then Group B and D. The survival time of filter vesicles in Group A was longer than that in other groups. There were no postoperative complications in each group. The conjunctival epithelium of Group A had better integrity and fewer subconjunctival fibroblasts than other groups. There was no obvious inflammation or infiltration around the filtering mouth and there were fewer new collagen fibers. RAPA-CS-CA slow-release microspheres safely and effectively inhibited the proliferation of fibroblasts and neonatal collagen fibers in rabbit glaucoma filtration surgery and significantly improved the success rate of glaucoma filtration surgery."
446,Effective optical nanoparticles and nanocomposites based on a carbon nanotubes-organic—inorganic nanohybrid for industrial pollutant removal,2020-06-01,"Improving the optical properties of zinc oxide to meet the practical requirements of photocatalytic reactions and solar cells is an ongoing challenge. To address this challenge, different nanostructures of ZnO were prepared from an organic—inorganic-CNTs nanohybrid. The nanohybrid was formed through intercalation of the long chain fatty acid C17H35COOH and carbon nanotubes into Zn–Al nanolayered structures. X-ray diffraction revealed an increase in the interlayer spacing of the Zn–Al layered double hydroxides from 0.75 nm to 2.1 nm after admixing with the CNTs and organic fatty acid. Thermal analyses and FTIR confirmed the formation of the CNTs–C18–Zn–Al nanohybrid. Three different thermal treatments were used to transform the nanohybrid into nanostructures of doped zinc oxide nanoparticles and zinc aluminum oxide nanocomposites. As a result of changes in the nano size and structure, the band gap energy of the products decreased from 3.3 eV to 1.8 eV, to give efficient photocatalysts. The nanomaterials were used to purify water through the photocatalytic degradation of colored pollutants under UV light. A kinetic study showed that water purification was achieved within a short time, demonstrating the effectiveness of the nanomaterials. The nanohybrid and its derivatives are attractive materials for designing-efficient photocatalysts for pollutant degradation."
447,Production and enzymatic degradation of poly(ε-caprolactone)/graphene oxide composites,2020-06-01,"Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) based composites containing different graphene oxide (GO) contents (0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 wt%) were produced by the solution mixing method followed by compression molding and enzymatically degraded in a pH 7.4 phosphate buffer solution containing Pseudomonas lipase at 37 °C. Morphological changes, molecular weight, calorimetric and mechanical properties were analyzed according to graphene oxide content. The study of tensile properties showed that the composites increased their Young’s modulus, while tensile strength and elongation at break decreased to significantly less than that of neat PCL. PCL composite crystallinity was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). It was found that incorporating GO can reduce nucleation activity as well as crystallization rates, from 67.6% for neat PCL to 50.6% for a composite with 0.5 wt% GO content. For enzymatic degradation, the weight loss data showed that incorporating GO into the PCL significantly altered enzymatic degradation. The presence of GO did not alter PCL’s hydrolysis mechanism, but did slow down composite enzymatic degradation in proportion to the percentage of filler content."
448,CD44-specific A6 nano-short peptide enhances the targeting and mechanism of doxorubicin on the surface of polymers for multiple myeloma,2020-06-01,"In this study, we sought to prepare epirubicin immunonanoparticles and observe their antibody activity, drug release in vitro, and antitumor effects in vitro. Epirubicin nanoparticles (e-adm-nps) were synthesized using the polyelectrolyte complex method, and monoclonal antibody nanoparticles were synthesized using a chemical cross-linking method. The antibody activity of epirubicin monoclonal antibody nanoparticles (emadm ab nps) was detected by ELISA, the drug release in vitro was measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometry, and the cytotoxic effect in vitro was detected using a thiazole blue assay. The average particle size of e-adm-ab-nps was 190 (±21) mm, and the antibody activity was well preserved. in vitro drug release analysis showed that e-admab-nps had sustained-release characteristics, and the cumulative release of e-adm-ab-nps reached 93.46% in 10 days. The cytotoxic effect of e-adm in vitro was time-dependent over 1 to 6 days, and dose-dependent over 1 to 10 days, although the difference between e-adm-ab-nps and e-adm at the same concentrations was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). E-adm-abnps show a sustained-release effect and immune activity, can prolong the effective time of e-adm for mouse multiple myeloma cells, and have no effect on the biological activity of epirubicin."
449,Hepatocellular carcinoma cell apoptosis induced by low-intensity ultrasound with polylactic acid-polyethylene glycol nanometer microspheres loaded with sodium cantharidin: An  study,2020-06-01,"This study examines the synergistic inhibitory effect of two drugs on hepatocellular carcinoma cells using polylactic acid-polyethylene glycol (PLA-PEG) nanoparticles loaded with sodium cantharidin (SCA) combined with low-intensity ultrasound. We sought to provide an experimental basis for the cytological level of SCA combined with low-intensity ultrasound tumor treatment. The study consisted of four treatment groups: HepG2 cells treated with 2.5 g/mL SCA for 30 min then irradiated with 0.5 w/cm2 low-intensity ultrasound for 8 s (combination group), HepG2 cells treated with SCA alone (SCA group), HepG2 cells randomly irradiated with low-intensity ultrasound (ultrasound group), and HepG2 cells without intervention (control group). After each treatment, the cells were cultured for 6 h, and then the cell proliferation inhibition rate, apoptosis cycle, and intracellular calcium concentration were detected using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, flow cytometry and Fluo-3 AM detection. Intracellular ultrastructural changes were observed using transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that the proliferation inhibition rate of cells in the combination group was significantly higher than that in the SCA and ultrasound groups. Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide staining revealed that the apoptosis rate of the combination group significantly increased compared with that of the other groups. There was no significant difference in cell cycle among the different treatments after 6 h of cell culture. However, cell cycle arrest occurred in HepG2 cells at G0/G1 stage after 12 h of cell culture. Fluo-3 AM showed that the intracellular calcium concentration in the combined group was significantly higher than that in the other groups at 6 h after treatment. Transmission electron microscopy showed that apoptotic bodies and mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum swelling were present in the combined group after treatment. We conclude that low-intensity ultrasound (0.5 w/cm2) combined with SCA (2.5 μg/mL) synergistically induce apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells, block cell cycle at G0/G1 phase, and disrupt intracellular calcium homeostasis. PLA-PEG can be loaded with SCA to improve drug targeting and drug concentration in the affected area."
450,Poly(-caprolactone)/graphene oxide composite systems: A comparative study on hydrolytic degradation at extreme pH values,2020-06-01,"Polycaprolactone/Graphene oxide (PCL/GO) composites are shown to be promising substrates for tissue engineering as their degradation behavior is a key aspect in this type of application. The present paper studies the effect of different GO contents (0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 wt%) of PCL/GO composites on accelerated hydrolytic degradation at extreme pH values. Degradation kinetics at pH 13 is strongly affected by GO content, and speed up at higher percentages. The composite with 0.5 wt% of GO was completely degraded in 72 hours, while degradation at pH 1 presents a different profile and seems to have an induction period that lasts more than 1500 hours. Morphological changes, molecular weight distribution, weight loss, degree of swelling and calorimetric properties were investigated as a function of degradation time. According to the results obtained, the addition of small percentages of GO significantly influences the degradation behavior of the composites acting as degradation modulators."
451,"A comparative study of C( = 4, 5, 7)F plasmas for dry etch processing",2020-06-01,"In this study, the SiO2 etch characteristics of perfluorocarbon such as C4F8, C5F8, and C7F8 were investigated using inductively coupled plasmas (ICPs) to study the effect of a high C/F ratio on the etch characteristics of SiO2 for the ICP. The SiO2 rates and etch selectivities over Si3N4 and amorphous carbon layer (ACL) were measured by using the mixtures of C x (x = 4, 5, 7)F8/Ar/O2. The higher C/F ratio of perfluorocarbon showed lower SiO2 etch rate but exhibited higher etch selectivities over Si3N4 and ACL due to the higher C2 while keeping the similar F in the plasma as observed by optical emission spectroscopy and due to the thicker fluorocarbon layer with more carbon-rich fluorocarbon on the materials surface as observed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Especially, C7F8 is environmentally benign material because it not only has a relatively low global warming potential but also can be captured easily using a capture system (a liquid state at the room temperature). Therefore, C7F8 could be applicable as one of the next generation perfluorocarbon etching materials."
452,Simple-chemical synthetic route for the preparation of Ag nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide,2020-06-01,"A simple-chemical synthetic approach to the preparation of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) decorated with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is demonstrated, which are appealing as a promising composite to treat the various diseases. The one-step strategy was used to reduce synthetic graphene oxide (GO) and to prepare AgNPs. EDX element mapping analysis presented the Ag content in the prepared rGO-Ag composite. HRTEM revealed that mono-dispersed AgNPs anchored on the rGO. The functional groups present on the surface of the materials were identified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). UV-Vis absorption study provided information about the electronic states of the materials. The results showed the highly transparent rGO sheets decorated with AgNPs."
453,Molybdenum disulfide nanomaterial sensor-based detection of breast cancer microRNA,2020-06-01,"In this study, we sought to establish a rapid, simple, highly sensitive, and highly specific fluorescence sensor for the detection of breast cancer-related microRNA (miRNA) based on the novel nanomaterial known as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). MoS2, a novel nanomaterial, was added to a fluorescently-labeled DNA probe system to construct a fluorescence sensor. Furthermore, non-complementary miRNAs, single-base mismatched miRNAs, and different concentrations of complementary miRNAs were hybridized with the fluorescently-labeled DNA probe. Then, miRNAs were detected by measuring changes in the fluorescence signals before and after hybridization. The detection was completed within 40 min. The detection limit of complementary miRNA reached pmol/L levels while distinguishing between complementary, non-complementary, and single-base mismatched miRNAs. The MoS2 fluorescence sensor demonstrated rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and high specificity. Additionally, this established detection method has the potential for application in the rapid detection of breast cancer-related miRNA as a promising cancer detection method."
454,Facile synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide/prussian blue/amino-terminated perylene derivative nanomaterials,2020-06-01,"We report a facile and effective way to prepare graphene oxide/prussian blue/amino-terminated perylene derivative nanomaterials (GO/PB/PTCNH2). The morphology, size and function of prepared carbon-based composite material were characterized by using field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectrophotometer and electrochemical technology. As a result, PB nanoparticles and PTCNH2 were uniformly dispersed on a typical origami GO sheet, and GO/PB/PTCNH2 nanocomposite had good stability and electrochemical properties."
455,Study of the mechanical properties and toughening mechanism of ZrO particles toughened SiN ceramics,2020-06-01,"Si3N4 ceramic has excellent properties such as high temperature resistance, high hardness, and high thermal stability, but it has the disadvantages of high hardness and brittleness and difficulty in later processing. In this paper, ZrO2 was used as toughening phase, and ZrO2 toughened Si3N4 ceramics was prepared by injection molding. The effects of ZrO2 sintering temperature and content on the mechanical properties and fracture morphology were studied. Experiments show that when the ZrO2 content is 10 wt.% and the sintering temperature reaches 1650 °C, the bending strength and fracture toughness of Si3N4 ceramics reach the maximum at the same time, which are 767 MPa and 8.7 MPa·m1/2, respectively. The density is high. XRD analysis revealed that if the sintering temperature is too high, the ZrO2/Si3N4 system will generate a large number of ZrN impurity phases that cannot be phase-transformed, which ultimately affects the ceramic properties. According to fracture morphology, the toughening mechanism of ZrO2 is stress-induced phase transition."
456,Synthesis of low toxicity metal-organic framework carrier for drug release,2020-06-01,"In this study, the [Zn(4,4′-bipy)(formic acid)2(NO3)2] (4,4′-bipy = 4,4′-bipyridine) metal-organic framework (MOF) (1) was synthesized using Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 4,4′-bipyridine according to the solution solvothermal approach. In addition, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), power X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV spectrophotometry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were carried out to determine the crystal phase and characterizations of 1. Thereafter, 1 was adopted to carry 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which displayed a 5-FU loading of 37.9 wt%. Besides, the 5-FU-loaded 1 displayed pH-sensitive behavior with the release of 5-FU in acidic environment. Typically, the 5-FU release process was progressive and under efficient control, and 93% 5-FU was released in acidic environment at 72 h later, but only 58% 5-FU was released in the phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH = 7.4). Furthermore, the toxicity of 1 was evaluated through cytotoxicity assays in HeLa and L02 cell lines, which showed significantly low toxicity of 1. Taken together, these results indicate that, the prepared 1 may potentially serve as a suitable carrier for drug delivery applications."
457,Low-cycle fatigue behavior of 7075-T6 aluminum alloy at different strain amplitudes,2020-06-01,"Low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life and failure mechanism of 7075-T6 high strength aluminum alloys were investigated under MTS 809. The cycling stress response and the cyclic stress—strain relationships under different strain amplitudes were investigated. Using Manson-Coffin law, the three parameter exponential function equation and the damage function model of tensile hysteresis energy (Ostergren equation), the regression analysis of LCF test data was carried out, it was found that the fatigue life prediction results of the three parameter exponential function equation were better than the other two life prediction methods in terms of statistical analysis methods of standard deviation and dispersion band. Analysis of microstructure and fatigue failure fracture revealed that fatigue crack initiated at the interface of precipitations and α-phase aluminium substrate in surface or near surface of the sample."
458,Durability of a new type of cement-based composite grouting material under effects of chemical corrosion,2020-06-01,"Corrosion resistance and durability are important performance features for grouting materials in underground engineering. The grouts based on ordinary Portland cement are difficult to solve water inrush disasters. To solve these problems, a new type of sulphoaluminate-cement-based Composite Grouting Material (CGM) has been developed. In this research, the chemical corrosion mechanism was analyzed, and the durability and anti-corrosion performance of CGM were studied under different concentrations of sulfate and chloride ions, steel slag contents and water/CGM (W/CGM) ratios. The flexural strength, compressive strength and corrosion resistance coefficient of CGM were measured in dependence of the days. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was carried out to determine the anti-corrosion characteristic of CGM. The results showed that the corrosion resistance coefficients of CGM are generally larger than 1.0 under different sulfate and chloride ion concentrations. Steel slag prevents sulfate ions from penetrating the hardened stone body, and the anticorrosion performance of CGM was relatively low at high W/CGM ratios."
459,Molecular ecotoxicological effect of CuO nanoparticles stress on ,2020-06-01,"In this research, responsive sensitivities of hepatopancreatic Na+, K+-ATPase, malondialdehyde (MDA) and heat shock protein 70 family (HSP70) in Bellamya aeruginosa to CuO nanoparticles (CuO-NPs) were investigated through sediment bioassay, potential molecular ecotoxicological mechanism of CuO-NPs stress on Bellamya aeruginosa was explored, and feasibility of Na+, K+-ATPase, MDA and HSP70 as biomarkers for CuO-NPs contaminated sediment was evaluated. The results showed that under the stress of CuO-NPs, three molecular biomarkers displayed significant concentration- and time-effect relationships. After exposure to contaminated sediment with different concentrations of CuO-NPs, the Na+, K+-ATPase activity initially increased and then deceased; the content of low MDA initially increased and then deceased as well, while the content of high MDA showed a fluctuated trend. For HSP70, short exposure time (3 d) induced a sharp increase in HSP70 expression, but long exposure time had little effect on HSP70 expression. It demonstrated that the hepatopancreatic Na+, K+-ATPase activity and MDA content showed good sensitivity to CuO-NPs stress, whereas HSP70 only responded to CuO-NPs stress within short exposure time. HSP70 may be not a suitable long-term biomarker for CuO-NPs stress."

461,Synthesis and cytotoxic evaluation of gum arabic surface modified cadmium telluride quantum dots,2020-05-01,"Water-soluble cadmium telluride (CdTe) quantum dots (QDs) were capped with gum Arabic (GA) is a non-toxic, water-soluble glycoprotein polymer commonly used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. The GA was used to stabilise cadmium telluride quantum dots (GA-QDs) and provides functional groups for other molecules such as nucleic acids, peptides and antibodies to be attached to the QDs for biological and biomedical appli- cations. In this study, the GA was used to cap and stabilise QDs using two different methods. These QDs were characterised using Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, X-powder ray diffraction (XRD), High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, zeta potential and particle size distribu- tions. Cytotoxicity of these QDs was also investigated using four different human cell lines; HeLa, MCF-7, PC-3 and U87 cancer cells. The QDs-MPA was capped with 3-mercaptopropionic acid, QDs-GA2 was stabilized and capped with GA at 60 °C for two hours, and QDs-GA12 was stabilized and capped with GA for twelve hours at room temperature (25 °C) with continuous stirring; These QDs were found to be highly luminescent with PL values of 675 nm, 678 nm and 677 nm respectively. The average polydispersity index (PDI) were 0.36 ± 0.02, 0.27 ± 0.02, 0.35 ± 0.01 for QDs-MPA, QDs-GA2 and QDs-GA12, respectively. The average particles size from HRTEM, XRD and hydrodynamic size showed that the QDs-GA have bigger particles sizes; (56.12 nm ± 1.14), (68.69 nm ± 2.08) and (77.85 nm ± 1.69) for QDs-MPA, QD-GA2 and QD-GA12 respectively. Cytotoxicity studies of these QDs were carried out using WST-1 cell proliferation assay on four different tumour cell line. The results showed that these cells were over 50 per cent viable and the QDs-GA capped had higher cell percentage viability."
462,High reliability thermistor probes for early detection of breast cancer using skin contact thermometry with thermal imaging,2020-05-01,"Early detection and wide spread screening of breast cancer can reduce the mortality rate considerably. Affordable and easy to use screening device is essential for mass screening. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple, precise and easy tool for screening and early detection of breast cancer based on the higher temperature of abnormal tissues. We have made excellent reliability chip thermal sensor probes and developed 3D and 2D thermal imaging system that can predict the hot spot precisely by simple surface temperature measurements. The chip thermal sensor probes show less than 0.5% drift in resistance upon thermal and electrical aging. Various phantom experiments were conducted to demonstrate the use of chip thermistor probes for predicting the position of the heater location accurately. We have also found that the subtle changes in surface temperatures were accurately picked up by the thermistors. It is observed that simulated and experimental results were having best fit within root mean square error of 0.055."

Therefore, the results demonstrated that the ZnS/p-GaN heterojunction was successfully fabricated using this relatively low-cost method."
464,Effects of YO on the microstructure and wear resistance of WC/Ni composite coatings fabricated by plasma transferred arc,2020-05-01,"The present study envisaged the WC-reinforced nickel composite coatings prepared on the surface of 4145H steel using the plasma transferred arc (PTA) method. The effects of different content of Y2O3 on the microscopic morphology, phase composition, micro-hardness and wear behavior were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), micro-hardness test and wear experiments. The deposited coatings consisted of WC-reinforced Ni59 composite coatings with the addition of 0 wt%, 0.5 wt% and 1 wt% Y2O3. Microstructural observation showed that the addition of 0.5 wt% Y2O3 had a better improvement on the coarse dendrites and the grain refinement. The main phase composition of the composite coatings was γ-Ni, FeNi3 solid solution, γ(Fe, Ni) eutectic phase, and the hard phase of WC, W2C. The cladding layer added with 0.5 wt% Y2 O3 was preferable over the Y2O3-free coating, as the microhardness was improved from 500 HV to 800 HV with a slight fluctuation of values. The coating with 0.5 wt% Y2O3 offered an excellent wear resistance to the extrusion and cracks for the uniformity of organizational structure compared with the substrate and the other two coatings. Furthermore, the results of weightlessness and coefficient of friction proved the positive effect of the rare earth Y2O3 on the wear resistance."
465,Effects of surface microstructure and molding parameters on injection bonding strength of polyphenylenesulphide-aluminum alloy,2020-05-01,The direct injection molding process of PPS-aluminum alloy composite parts under vacuum condition was conducted and the processing parameters were optimized through the numerical simulation and orthogonal test design. The effect of surface microstructure of the aluminum alloy splines and injection molding processing parameters on the bonding strength of the composite parts were discussed. The results show that the bonding strength of the composite parts increases with not only the increase in the diameter and quantity of the microscopic pores and also the surface roughness of the aluminum alloy splines. The bonding strength can also been improved under a higher vacuum. The bonding strength is highly correlated to the micromechanical interlocking structure formed by the PPS embedding into the rough surface of the aluminum alloy splines.
466,Individualized artificial titanium alloy spinal lamina with 3D printing technology,2020-05-01,"Background: Laminectomy and decompression is a common procedure for treating spine diseases. However, due to the lack of a posterior, bony braced structure, the dural sac and nerve roots can adhere to the surrounding tissues, and scar formation can occur in muscle and soft tissues. This can cause new compression post surgery, and failure of the operation. Objective: This study aimed to produce an individualized titanium alloy spine lamina using 3D printing technology, and to evaluate its effectiveness by implantation in human cadaveric spines. Methods: Six adult lumbar cadaver specimens were used, and computed tomography (CT) was used to obtain DICOM medical digital image standard data. The lumbar vertebrae structure was reconstructed by three-dimensional (3D) modeling software, and then simulated lumbar laminectomy was performed. Based on the characteristics of the original lamina, an artificial spine lamina was designed, including suture holes at the posterior ligament attachment point and a locking screw hole for fixation. A titanium alloy spine lamina was fabricated by 3D printing, and a guide plate to assist artificial lamina implantation was designed. Using the guide plated, L4 lumbar vertebrae segment laminectomy was performed on the 6 lumbar spine specimens, titanium alloy spine lamina were implanted and fixed with cortical bone trajectory screws. After implantation, CT was performed to record the length of the screw, the trajectory of the screw in the pedicle, and changes of bony spinal canal volume and anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal. Results: The morphology of artificial spine lamina matched that of the original lamina. The artificial lamina was easy to implant, and matched the original lamina. The laminas were fixed by 12 cortical screws (diameter, 4.5 mm; median length, 34.67 ± 1.97 mm). CT scan indicated that all screws passed through the pedicle cortex by < 2 mm (2 screws penetrated the inner wall). The bony canal volume of the L4 vertebral pedicle was 311.23 ± 38.17 mm2 before operation and 356.17 ± 43.11 mm2 after operation, and there was statistical difference (P < 0.001). The anteroposterior diameter of spinal canal was 17.82 ± 2.03 mm before surgery and 20.67 ± 2.38 mm after surgery, and they were statistically different (P < 0.001). Conclusion: An individualized artificial titanium alloy spine lamina designed and produced with 3D printing technology can be used to reconstruct the structure of the posterior spine complex after lumbar laminectomy. The artificial lamina can increase the volume of the spinal canal and provide a posterior ligament reconstruction attachment point."
467,Rheology and fluid loss of a polyacrylamide-based micro-gel particles in a water-based drilling fluid,2020-05-01,"In this paper, the cross-linked micro-gel polymer between acrylamide (AM) and N, N-Methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) was synthesized by dispersion polymerization. The initiator and crosslinking agent concentration were used to control the particle size of micro-gel polymer. The filtration property and mechanism of micro-gel were investigated comprehensively. The characteristics of micro-gel were checked by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, transmission electron microscopy, and particle size distribution, respectively. The results indicated that the cross-linked micro-gel polymer exhibited several outstanding merits, such as thermal stability (up to 200 °C), filtration control and rheological property. Microstructure analysis and particle size distribution examinations showed that the scale of micro-gel polymer was micro, which is in accord with design. Rheological tests demonstrated that the nonlinear structure of micro-gel polymer showed less impact on the apparent viscosity. The anti-high temperature property of micro-gel polymer was better than poly anioniccellulose (PAC) and asphalt widely applied in drilling fluid for anti-high temperature fluid-loss additive. As a result, the cross-linked micro-gel polymer had great potential to be applied in high temperature water-based mud."
468,Analysis of tribological properties of graphite and aluminum composite materials prepared by powder metallurgy technique,2020-05-01,"In order to make full use of the wear resistance and antifriction of the mixed reinforced particles, improve the performance and utilization rate of the composite material, and reduce its wear amount, in this study, graphite and aluminum composite materials with different graphite concentration were prepared by powder metallurgy process. On this basis, the influence of different graphite concentration on the friction coefficient and wear amount of composite samples and different load on the wear amount of composite materials were discussed and analyzed. The results show that with the increase of graphite content, the friction coefficient and wear amount of the composite will decrease correspondingly. When the load is less than 30 N, the wear curve of the sample changes steadily. When the load is more than 30 N, the wear will increase sharply. Therefore, the analysis of the tribological properties of the graphite and aluminum composites based on the powder metallurgy process plays an important role in improving the utilization rate of the composite and reducing its wear."
469,Enhanced desalination process using a Cu–ZnO-polyvinyl chloride-nylon nanofiltration membrane as a calcite antiscalant in reverse osmosis,2020-05-01,"Treatment and cleaning of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes saturated with CaCO3/brine is a main issue in RO desalination processes. Herein, a Cu–ZnO-polyvinyl chloride (PVC)-nylon nanofiltration membrane was synthesized and utilized to minimize and/or eliminate CaCO3/brine during RO, along with probing the effects of Cu–ZnO antiscalant on calcite precipitation in normal aqueous and supersaturated CaCO3/brine solutions. Moreover, decreases in Ca2+ content over time were evaluated by electrical conductivity and pH measurements. Results revealed that Cu–ZnO nanocomposite substantially increases induction time and stimulates the formation of aragonite rather than calcite. A 2 mg/L dose of Cu–ZnO nanocomposite suppressed CaCO3 in both unsaturated and supersaturated solutions. In natural water sources (containing ∼500 mg/L calcium and ≈300 mg/L bicarbonate content), complete removal of CaCO3 blockage was achieved by using 2.5 mg/L of Cu–ZnO antiscalant, while in supersaturated water solutions (1000 mg/L calcium and ≈500 mg/L bicarbonate content), only 2 mg/L of Cu–ZnO antiscalant was required to fully remove the blockage. Importantly, addition of 2 mg/L of Cu–ZnO antiscalant to RO brine showed no apparent deposition on the membrane surface after 6 h, with a minimal flux decrease to 86.5%. Thus, Cu–ZnO-PVC-nylon nanofiltration membranes with low concentrations (2 mg/L) of Cu–ZnO antiscalant can play a significant role in the treatment of supersaturated CaCO3/brine water discharge."
470,Large-scale preparation and electrochemical characterization of NaTi(PO)/C composite nanoparticles as anode materials in sodium ion batteries,2020-05-01,"Materials with NASICON structure, such as NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP), are widely studied in the field of sodium ion battery. They have potential applications, but their conductivity is poor. Nanostructure can shorten the ion and electron transport paths and make electrolytes permeable easily. Generally speaking, the electric conductivity of battery materials can be improved by adding appropriate amount of carbon. In this paper, large-scale NTP/C nanomaterial of kilogram level was prepared by spray drying. The as-prepared NTP/C nanomaterial shows good electrochemical performance. At 5 C, the initial specific capacity is 69 mA h g–1, and the capacity after 2000 cycles is about 73.2% of the initial capacity."
471,Synthesis of Cu–Ag core–shell nanoparticles as highly active surface-enhanced Raman scattering substrates for sensitive detection of caffeic acid,2020-05-01,"Core–shell nano-metal structures as SERS probes have drawn attention and have been applied to detecting analytes at low concentrations. Here, we have developed a novel SERS probe composed of Cu–Ag for the quantitative, rapid and ultrasensitive detection of caffeic acid. The surface of Cu–Ag was modified with 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (4-MPBA) to allow the probe to detect caffeic acid, wherein 4-MPBA specifically binds to caffeic acid by an esterification reaction. The results obtained in this work show that the SERS performance of the 4-MPBA substrate is better than that of the Cu–Ag substrate. To determine the binding of caffeic acid to 4-MPBA, the B-OH stretching vibration at 1170 cm–1 was selected as the representative signal. It was found that there is a linear relationship between the intensity of the peak at 1170 cm–1 and the concentration of caffeic acid."
472,Establishing a method for the expansion of human regulatory T cells with a high-efficiency ,2020-05-01,"The objective of this study is to establish a method to isolate and culture regulatory T cells with a high-efficiency in vitro. The CD4+, CD25+, and CD127low T cells were isolated through fluorescence activated cells sorting and cultured in vitro with anti-CD3-anti-CD28-coated microbeads and IL-2 for two weeks. The number of cells was determined to evaluate the expansion ability, the phenotype of the expanded cells was identified with flow cytometry, and the suppressive function was examined by mixed lymphocyte reaction. The CD4+CD25+CD127low T cells were efficiently amplified in vitro using magnetic beads (Fe3O4). A mean expansion of (755.5 ± 213.5) fold was obtained after the cells were cultured for two weeks. In addition, the expressions of CD4, CD19, CD8, and CD25 in the expanded cells were estimated at (98.3 ± 1.04)%, (0.039 ± 0.021)%, (0.443 ± 0.239)%, and (97.6 ± 1.35)%, respectively. FOXP3+ cells accounted for (87.7 ± 5.5)% of the expanded cells, while Helios+ cells accounted for (73.3 ± 2.9)%. The cultured cells demonstrated the highest suppressive capacity with (84.39 ± 1.98)% suppression of the activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells at a responder: regulatory T cells (Treg) ratio of 1:1. This research suggests a method to obtain a large quantity of Tregs with a high-efficiency in vitro. The expanded cells remain in their original phenotype and demonstrate the ability of immune suppression, which plays enormous significance in the cell therapy for treating autoimmune diseases and transplant rejections."
473,Exploring distillation-pervaporation hybrid process in a single column using hollow fiber pervaporation composite membranes as structured packing,2020-05-01,"This study developed a novel strategy for azeotrope separation such as ethanol-water binary system. Distillation-pervaporation hybrid process was employed by using hollow fiber pervaporation composite membranes as structured packing in a single hybrid column rather than using pervaporation as an externally connected unit of the distillation column. The separating limitation of azeotrope challenged in conventional distillation could be readily overcome by continually removing water from the hybrid system via pervaporation. The competition between distillation and pervaporation has been found to be cause of unexpected concentration distribution in the hybrid column. The mass flux of mixture decreased with time whereas the selectivity of water to ethanol first increased then decreased with time. Analysis of this system illustrated that the increase in heating power and membrane area shortened time for obtaining certain content of ethanol in the mixture. However, faster decline in mass flux occurred due to an increase in the removal rate of water. With respect to its simplicity, efficiency and broad applicability, this hybrid process is expected to provide a benchmark for the enhancement of distillation-pervaporation process by hollow fiber membrane packing."
474,Study of prednisolone and rituximab in nephrotic syndrome based on novel nanomaterials,2020-05-01,"In the search for a more reasonable yet effective treatment method, this study explores the application of nanometer magnetic particles and prednisolone combined with rituximab in children with nephrotic syndrome (NS). According to the diagnostic criteria of children with hormone sensitivity and frequent recurrence of primary NS from the nephrology group of the Chinese Academy of Pediatrics, 40 children with NS diagnosed in our hospital from January 2018 to October 2019 were selected. Nanomagnetic α-Fe2O3 particles were prepared by chemical reaction synthesis. Before and after treatment, urine protein, oral hormone dosage, changes in peripheral blood CD19 + B lymphocyte levels, changes in plasma immunoglobulin levels, and patient general improvement were observed, along with the recurrence of renal disease after treatment. Immunoglobulin was measured by the immunoturbidimetric method, and the endpoint of the follow-up was the first relapse after administration. This study shows that the use of nanomagnetic particles and prednisolone in combination with rituximab in the treatment of pediatric NS has a significant effect, improving the renal function indicators of children and effectively controlling the condition of children while maintaining a higher level of safety."
475,Controllable function equation of silicone elastic materials through MATLAB and its tribological properties,2020-05-01,"The precise controllability of the elastic abrasive tool has always been a major problem in the engineering field. Based on the previous experiments, the objectives and scope of the research fit the compression controllability function equation of the elastic abrasive tool based on MATLAB software. The compression mechanics characteristics of elastic abrasives were analyzed. The reliability of the equations and the tribological properties of elastic abrasives were studied. The results show that the cell size and density of the foamed composite have a great influence on the compressive mechanical properties and tribological properties of the material. The thickness of the matrix among the holes will determine the elastic resistance of the material and the surface quality of the workpiece to be processed."
476,Phospholipase C-like protein 2 (PLC-L2) is associated with cytolytic ability of CD8 T cells and prognosis of prostate cancer,2020-05-01,"PLC-L2, whose related members of its family facilitate in the differentiation of T cells, is a potential epigenetic marker for PCa. The density of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in PCa is associated with a better prognosis. It remains unclear how PLC-L2 affects the TIL and PCa. A human tissue microarray (TMA) and PCa patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas were used to address the correlations between PLC-L2 and the infiltrated immune cells and to evaluate the relationship between PLC-L2 and prognosis of PCa patients. More advanced PCa expressed less PLC-L2 than less advanced PCa, in terms of pathological grade, clinical stage, and the presence of lymph node and distant metastasis. Besides, the expression of PLC-L2 had positive correlations with CD8+ T cells and antigen-presenting cells such as macrophage and dendritic cells. PLC-L2 expression was also positively correlated with local immune cytolytic ability, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-12A, IL-12B, and IL-18. Furthermore, PLC-L2 expression was an independent factor of a favorable prognosis in PCa patients. This study reveals that PLC-L2 might recruit CD8+ T cells and promote their cytolytic ability in PCa. PLC-L2 accompanied by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells could suppress the development of PCa and subsequently increase prognosis in PCa patients."
477,Effect of fiber types on the electrical properties of fiber reinforced concrete,2020-05-01,"Using fibers in concrete, has been recognized as a practical method to improve concrete properties such as reduction in crack development and higher resistance against impact and abrasion. Dry cementitious material exhibits very high electrical resistivity. However, fibers can significantly decrease the electrical resistivity of concrete which affects its insulating nature and has negative effects on concrete properties such as durability and also in special cases such as rail road ties production. In this paper the effect of steel, glass, and nylon fiber on the electrical properties of Fiber Reinforced Concrete (FRC) is investigated. Six different fiber volume fractions (Vf ) (0.10% vol., 0.25% vol., 0.50% vol., 0.75% vol., 1.00% vol., 1.50% vol.) and several water-to-cement ratios (w/c) were considered as the main variables in the present study. In order to test the electrical properties of FRC, 100 mm × 200 mm cylinders were casted, cured and tested. The four point technique was used for measuring the surface electrical resistivity of concrete after curing in water for 3, 7, 28, and 44 days. Additionally, the compressive strength of each specimen was determined experimentally using the Compression Test Machine. The results revealed that the electrical resistivity of FRC decreases with an increase in fiber content but different types of fibers have different electrical effects on concrete. The effects of different volume fractions of three fiber types, together with different concrete mix proportions are presented and discussed."

We assessed the changes in visual acuity, diopter change, axial length, corneal endothelium count, intraocular pressure, and corneal Q value in 30 adolescents with 60 years of wearing an orthokeratology lens. In this study, no significant difference was observed between the naked eye vision and corrected visual acuity before wearing the lens (t = –0.23, P = 0.59); furthermore, no significant difference was observed in diopter, axial length, corneal endothelium count, and intraocular pressure 1 year before and after wearing the lens (t = 1.24, P = 0.45; t = –0.89, P = 0.25; t = –0.43, P = 0.57; t = 1.43, P = 0.61); by contrast, there was a significant difference in the corneal Q value before and after wearing the lens (t = –8.37, P = 0.001). These results suggest that the fluorosilicone acrylic breathable material corneal orthopedic lens is safe and effective in controlling myopia, and has little effect on the physiology of the eye."
479,Study on the antipyretic effect of gypsum and its compatibility on yeast-induced pyrexia rats based on NF-B signaling pathway,2020-05-01,"To research the antipyretic function of gypsum and its compatibility on yeast-induced pyrexia rats based on NF-κB signaling pathway, the rat model of fever was replicated by subcutaneous injection of 20% yeast suspension in the back of the rat. Gypsum, Anemarrhenae, gypsum and Anemarrhena or aspirin was administered by gavage. Gypsum and its synergist reduced the body temperature of febrile rats significantly, and reduced the levels of fever-producing medium Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and pyrogenic factors including tumor necrosis factor(TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in rat serum also the level of central heating medium PGE2 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Furthermore, we demonstrated that gypsum and Anemarrhena concerted application inhibit NF-κB signal pathway in yeast-induced pyrexia rats. The results indicate that gypsum and its Anemarrhena concerted application may be a potential antipyretic and the antipyretic mechanism is attributed to the suppression of NF-κB signal pathway."
480,Clinical efficacy and safety of silver nanoparticlebased disinfectant combined with piperacillin sodium and sulbactam sodium in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infection,2020-05-01,"This study evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of piperacillin sulbactam in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections, as well as the efficacy of silver nanoparticle-based disinfectant in equipment disinfection to reduce exogenous infection. From May 2018 to November 2018, 100 patients that had been diagnosed with a lower respiratory tract infection and hospitalized were divided into an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group was given piperacillin/sulbactam, and the control group was given mezlocillin/sulbactam, where 5.0 g was added to 100 mL of normal saline and administered via intravenous drip twice a day over a treatment course of 14 days. The cure rate of the experimental and control groups were 65.22% and 56.52% respectively. The efficacy rate was 91.30% and 91.30% respectively, with no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). The results indicated that piperacillin/sulbactam is a safe, effective treatment for lower respiratory tract infections in elderly patients, the equipment was sterilized with silver nanoparticle-based disinfectant to reduce the incidence of adverse reactions and exogenous infections."
481,Nacre crystal growth as a paradigm of island growth mode: Hydrophobic substrate is one of the keys to the biomineralization,2020-05-01,"Nacre is a multilayered film material consisting of alternating layers of aragonitic tablets and organic membranes (OMs). However, at this time, no authors have discussed the growth mode of nacre from the perspective of the science of typical film materials. Here, for the first time, we focus on measuring the contact angles of the nacre growth surface (GS) using the contact angle meter. Additionally, we also investigate the GS's structure and phases using field emission scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometer, respectively. We firstly found that: (1) The contact angles of the GS are always greater than 90°, with a maximum value of 113° and minimum value of 91°, indicating that the GS is hydrophobic. (2) The growth mode of GS is similar to the island growth mode (V-W) of the typical films. (3) The hydrophobicity of OMs plays an important role in the nucleation and growth of nacre. This research may provide new insights into the mechanism underlying nacre formation. In the field of thin-film, this conclusion will provide a new direction for the preparation and research of hydrophobic substrates, and a new idea for the development of thin-film technology."
482,Static and fatigue performance of overlap welded thin plates,2020-04-01,Thin-plate overlap welding is an important connection method for the automobile chassis structure. The fatigue performance of the chassis structural components depends mostly on the welded joints. A detailed understanding of its performance plays an important guiding role in the design of the chassis structure. This study was aimed at investigating the performance of thin-plate overlap welded structures using the static tensile test and fatigue test. The general rule of the influence of base metal thickness on the static strength and fatigue performance of welded joints was also summarized. The failure mode of the welded joint and the crack propagation mechanism were discussed in terms of fracture morphology. The findings might lay a foundation for the anti-fatigue design and lightweight design of the chassis welded structures.

The relationship between the refractive index or the excess refractive index and the composition mole fraction were established at 20 °C."
484,Identification and analysis of fluoride-resistant  genomic mutation based on silicon solid nanopore,2020-04-01,"This aim of this study was to identify the genomic mutations present in fluoride-resistant Streptococcus mutans (strain UA159-FR) using next generation sequencing, and to establish the role of these mutations by comparing fluoride-sensitive (UA159) and UA159-FR strains. In this paper, the genome of UA159-FR strains was sequenced by PacBio RS and IIIumina sequencing platform using silica-based nanopore. The genomic alignment to the reference S. mutans strain UA159 (NC_004350) was conducted using MUMmer 3.22 to list all the structural variations (SVs), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels. A second round of Sanger sequencing of all regions in which the relevant mutations (SVs, indels, and SNPs) were identified was conducted to confirm these findings. In addition, blast comparison of virulence factor sequence was carried out. In order to explore the effect of the mutant gene against S. mutans, the KEGG pathway, COG function and go enrichment of the annotated gene were analyzed. Expressions of these variants were compared between S. mutans UA159 and UA159-FR through RT-qPCR. Genome sequencing revealed the presence of a single 2,031,692 bp circular chromosome, including 1940 ORFs, of which the G+C content was 37.46%. In addition, 35 genomic SNPs and 5 SVs type in UA159-FR were identified through an extensive bioinformatics analysis. The results of indel analysis showed that there was no insertion or deletion of genes in UA159 and UA159- FR; Synteny analysis showed that the gene of UA159 was collinear with UA159-FR, which further indicated that the main type of gene mutation was single base mutation. By comparing the amino acid sequences of UA159-FR samples with virulence factors, blast obtained 92 virulence factors, among which, ciaH, eno and pykF had gene mutations. The mutations of ciaH, eno and pykF may be responsible for the functional changes of Streptococcus. At the same time, enrichment analysis showed that the expression genes of S. mutans were mainly enriched in KEGG pathway such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, citric acid cycle (TCA cycle), pentose phosphate pathway, involved in DNA replication, and related to biological processes such as cell development and cell metabolism. ciaH, eno and pykF were involved in these processes. In summary, this study highlights new mutations in fluoride-resistant bacteria that may enhance our current understanding of fluoride-resistant pathways in microorganisms. It has been proved that silicon based nanopores and nanopores arrays can detect gene sequences sensitively and can be used as the main means of gene sequencing in the next generation."

486,"Investigation of the microstructure, mechanical properties and tensile behavior of a low carbon nickel-manganese dual-phase transformationinduced plasticity steel by heavy warm rolling",2020-04-01,"A dual phase (martensite–austenite) low carbon nickel-manganese transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) steel was fabricated by heavily warm rolling (HWR), and the effect of annealing on the phase fraction, mechanical properties and tensile deformation behavior of the heavily warm rolled (HWRed) steel was investigated. The results showed that the reverse transformation of γ-austenite from α′-martensite occurs and that the γ-austenite volume fraction (V  A ) decreases from 91% to 55% as the annealing temperature increases from 400 °C to 800 °C, respectively. The HWRed steel annealed at 400 °C exhibits a high strength-high ductility combination with yield strength of 706 MPa, ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 1573 MPa, total elongation (TEL) of 21.6%, and the product of the strength and elongation (PSE: UTS×TEL) is 34 GPa%. These excellent mechanical properties are principally attributed to the formation of a large volume fraction of austenite (γ) by the reverse transformation and subsequent TRIP effect during tensile deformation. It was found that the HWRed and annealed steels exhibit a special tensile behavior with a large yielding strain followed by pronounced strain hardening. The tensile curve can be readily divided into three obviously different stages. The strain-induced martensite (SIM) transformation (γ -α′) occurs in the early yielding deformation stage and in the intermediate rapidly hardening deformation stage, indicating that the TRIP effect dominates the process of these two stages. However, the retained γ-austenite remains very stable, and no TRIP effect is observed in the final hardening deformation stage. The load-unload reload (LUR) test was performed to evaluate the back stress (σ  b ) hardening effect during tensile testing. It is believed that the pronounced strain hardening behavior after yielding is mainly associated with the σ  b  enhancement induced by the strain partitioning between the soft retained γ-austenite and the hard α′-martensite due to the SIM transformation during tensile deformation."
487,Fabrication and characterization of solvent evaporation-assisted sodium caseinate emulsion films,2020-04-01,"As plastic pollution increases, the development of degradable film has attracted much attention. Sodium caseinate was suitable to be a degradable film material for its mechanical performance and appearance. Maize oil was added to improve the properties of film material by microfluidization and solvent evaporation. Microfluidization could improve the droplet distribution of maize oil in the film building dispersions and the performance of film material. Solvent evaporation could further control the droplet distribution and the characteristics of film materials. The introduction of ethyl acetate could refine the droplet of maize oil distributing in the film building dispersions. The mechanical characteristics, water blocking properties and microscopic structure of solvent evaporation-assisted sodium caseinate emulsion films were improved."
488,Hierarchical porous biomass activated carbon for hybrid battery capacitors derived from persimmon branches,2020-04-01,"Activated carbon materials are used in hybrid battery capacitors. They reduce energy density of devices, and can greatly improve the cycle life and power density. Herein, we used fast-growing persimmon branches in Shaanxi as a biomass carbon source. The persimmon branch activated carbon (PB-AC850) material was found to exhibit abundant graded pore structure similar to graphite structure after KOH activation. The macro/mesoporous structure in PB-AC850 facilitated the ions (solvated PF- 6 ) transport, resulting in much better rate capability as compared to commercial activated carbon. It was moreover found from preparation of the hybrid battery capacitor that the addition of activated carbon reduced resistance and polarization of the device. LFP+PB-AC850 exhibited excellent cycle stability with high to 93.4% capacity reservation after 500 cycles at 5C."
489,Experimental investigation on the preparation of active carbon with cottonwood based on phosphoric acid activation method,2020-04-01,"Active carbon was prepared experimentally by means of drying and crushing cottonwood via the phosphoric acid activation method. The effects of the activation temperature, impregnation ratio, phosphoric acid concentration, and activation time on the performance of the active carbon were analyzed. The optimum parameters of active carbon preparation, including the 60% concentration of the phosphoric acid, 1:4 impregnation ratio, 4 h activation time, and 500 °C activation temperature, were proposed. The features of the active carbon were analyzed with a scanning electron microscope and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The specific surface area was 1020 m2 · g-1, and the average pore diameter and the overall pore volume were 3.01 nm and 0.96 cm3 · g-1, respectively. These active carbon performance parameters prepared via the present method were compared with experimental data from relevant references. The adsorbance of the active carbon to the methylene blue solution was analyzed. Results showed that the adsorbance of the active carbon increased with the increment in the concentration of the methylene blue solution, stirring time, and the dosage of the active carbon. Therefore, 9.2% is the best adsorption amount of active carbon to the methylene blue solution at 25 mg/L methylene blue solution concentration, 30 mg active carbon mass fraction, and 4 h stirring time."
490,Convenient synthesis of TiO nanowires with anatase phase for high photocatalytic activity,2020-04-01,"Organic pollutants pose a serious threat to human health, and so their control by photocatalytic techniques has become an important field. There is an urgent need to devise convenient syntheses of effective photocatalysts for the degradation of contaminants. Here, high-performance anatase TiO2 nanowires have been obtained through a hydrothermal method followed by calcination at different temperatures in Ar. The products have been characterized by SEM, XRD, FTIR, and UV/Vis DRS measurements. The photocatalytic performances of the as-prepared catalysts in the degradation of rhodamine 6G (R6G) have been evaluated. The experimental results revealed that as-prepared TiO2 nanowires calcined at 600 °C (TNWs-600) exhibited the highest degree of R6G degradation (96%) under simulated solar irradiation. This could be attributed to their stable anatase phase with good photocatalytic activity, the excellent light absorption ability of which favors excitation. Overall, the fabricated TNWs-600 constitute a promising candidate material for photocatalytic applications in the removal of environmental pollutants."
491,"Hydrothermal synthesis, crystal and electronic structure of a new hydrated borate CsKBO(OH)·HO",2020-04-01,"Hydrothermal method successfully produced a new cesium-metal borate (CsKB4O5(OH)4·2H2O).

492,Meloxicam combined with temozolomide synergistically inhibits cell migration and induces apoptosis via the inhibition of AKT pathway in glioblastoma cell line LN18,2020-04-01,"Temozolomide (TMZ) is a widely known and promising therapeutic option for advanced glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, the recurrence of GBM due to intrinsic factors or acquired therapeutic resistance necessitates the development of novel treatments. Meloxicam (MEL), a potent selective cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitor, has been widely reported as an inhibitor of proliferation and invasion/migration in various tumors. In this study, we investigated the interaction of TMZ and MEL in GBM cell line LN18, and their potential combinatorial impact on cell biological activity and related downstream signaling pathways. MTT method was used to detect cell growth inhibition rate and scratch assay was applied to analyze the inhibitory effect on tumor cell migration. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed to assess the rate of apoptosis. Tumor cells (LN18) were incubated with the concerned drugs and high-quality protein lysate was prepared using magnetic beads method, which effectively absorbs target proteins. Western blotting was employed to detect PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and apoptosis-related protein caspase-3. We found that lower dose of TMZ or MEL alone minimally induced apoptosis and only modestly compromised the migration of LN18 cells in vitro through the inhibition of AKT. Interestingly, the combinatorial treatment with TMZ and MEL was found to present a synergistic antitumor efficacy. MEL combined with TMZ down-regulated AKT activation, indicating that such a treatment could effectively impair PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to induce tumor cell apoptosis and better inhibit tumor cell migration. These findings provide insights into the significance of combinatorial treatment for GBM."
493,Upconverting TiO spheres with light scattering effect for enhanced quantum dot-sensitized solar cells,2020-04-01,"Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) for solar cells could only absorb solar light in the visible region. Upconverters could convert near-infrared (NIR) photons into visible light photons that could be used to generate photocurrent by the sensitizers. Consequently, it is reasonable to utilize upconverters in the quantum dotsensitized solar cells (QDSCs) in order to broaden the light utilization region. In this article, Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped TiO2 spheres were integrated into the photoanodes for QDSCs. The influence of photoanode configuration on the performance of the QDSCs has been scrutinized. The photoanode with the optimized composite film was employed to fabricate QDSC, yielding a conversion efficiency (η) of 3.53%. The QDSC with the composite film photoanode outperforms that with the pure TiO2 film photoanode. The amplified cell performance for the composite photoanodes could be attributed to the following two aspects: first, the upconversion process of the upconverter leads to indirect exploitation of NIR light. Second, the light scattering effect of the upconverterdoped TiO2 spheres enhances the absorption of visible light."
494,F-actin microfilament polymerized by jasplakinolide affects the expression of aquaporin-4 in astrocytic swelling after oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation,2020-04-01,"This study was to determine whether Jasplakinolide (JSK), an actin microfilament polymerization, reduced the astrocytic swelling induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/Reox) and whether this effect could be mediated through the modulation of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expression. Astrocytes were obtained from rat spinal cord. Cells were subjected to reoxygenation after 5 h OGD. JSK with different concentrations (20, 50, 100, 200 and 400 nM) was added to astrocytes for 12 h before and during OGD/Reox. Then the cell volume and AQP4 expression were analyzed. The results showed that astrocytic swelling occurred with cell volume increasing after OGD/Reox and the severity was significantly attenuated by JSK. A strong increase of AQP4 protein expression was observed after OGD/Reox, reaching a peak at 1.5 h into reoxygenation. The increase in levels of AQP4 protein was significantly reduced by treatment with JSK. In addition, confocal microscopy analysis showed that the F-actin microfilament polymerization by JSK accounted for AQP4 downregulation in the plasma membrane. This study demonstrated that JSK could attenuate astrocytes swelling caused by OGD/Reox, an ischemia and reperfusion-like injury, and part of its protective effects might be related to the reorganization the F-actin microfilament and inhibiting the abundance expression of AQP4 protein."
495,Succinyl rotundic acid inhibits growth and promotes apoptosis in the HeLa cervical cancer cell line,2020-04-01,"Rotundic acid (RA) is a kind of pentacyclic triterpene saponins, which widely exists in holly and other plants. It has anti-tumor and lipid-lowering effects, and has been widely used in the prevention and treatment of vascular diseases. Succinyl RA (SRA) is a kind of circular acid derivative with strong water solubility. However, SRA’s effect and mechanism about the therapy of cervical cancer is still not clarified. The inhibitory effect of SRA on Hela cells and its molecular mechanism were investigated in this study. Hela cell line was used to establish an in vitro model to study the effect of SRA. The effects of SRA on cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry and detected by 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazole-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazole bromide. The experimental results show that SRA can inhibit the growth of Hela and diffusion, inducing cell apoptosis. SRA can also reduce the expression of CyclinD 1 and p21. It was also decreased the expression of apoptosis inhibitor B cell lymphoma (Bcl-2), and increased the expression of Bcl-2-related X-protein and Caspase-3. This study provides evidence for the progress of SRA in inhibiting Hela cells and presents potential applications of SRA as an alternative therapy for cervical cancer."
496,"Physalin B induces apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma through reactive oxygen species activation via TGF-, NF-B and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways",2020-04-01,"It is acknowledged that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cause the most cancer-associated mortality all around the world and the traditional Chinese medicine has been widely used in HCC treatment. Physalin B (PB) is the most important chemical compounds of a Chinese traditional herb, Physalis alkekengi var. franchetii. In this research, it is the first time in the world that we illustrated PB exhibits obvious apoptotic activity in SMMC-7721 and HepG2 human HCC cell lines in the does-dependent way. Moreover, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was found and the cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was obviously upregulated in PB-treated cell lines. Furthermore, the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins and ROS were increased after the treatment of PB, which were reversed by the inhibitor of TGF-β, NF-κB or PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Therefore, PB illustrates potent anticancer activity, which might be studied as a potentiation therapeutic medicine for HCC."
497,Effects of P-gpMAbNano-structured material nanoparticles on epilepsy and expression of SRY-related HMG Box 21 in epilepsy,2020-04-01,"SRY-related HMG box (SOX)21, one of the most highly expressed transcription inhibitors in the central nervous system (CNS), is involved in neurogenesis-related transcription and proliferation, which are associated with certain neurological disorders. However, it is the role of SOX21 in the pathogenesis of epilepsy remains unclear. In this study, our aim was to examine the expression and function of SOX21 in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), as well as pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-kindled rats, and to identify the possible roles of SOX21 in epileptogenesis. We found that SOX21 localized in neurons is upregulated, especially in TLE patients. SOX21 is present in the hippocampus or adjacent temporal cortex in the PTZ-kindled epileptic rat model. In addition, the P-gpMAbNano-structured material (PNM) nanoparticles carrying anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) were injected into the epileptic model rats using an intravenous injection. The expression of tumor necrosis factor peptide in the rats was detected to verify whether the drug-carrying nanoparticles could bypass macrophages and reach the target for treatment. We also found an interaction between SOX21 and SOX2 in PTZ-kindled rats. These results indicate that SOX21 is mainly located in neurons and may regulate the pathogenesis of epilepsy, possibly in association with SOX2. Moreover, PNM nanoparticles equipped with AEDs can reach the target through macrophages in vivo, providing a new approach for the clinical treatment of epilepsy."
498,Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) promotes ovarian cancer cell progression by Forkhead box O 3a (FOXO3a) inhibition,2020-04-01,"Recently, LSD1 is considered as a possible therapeutic mark for ovarian epithelial cancer (OEC). Though, the underlying molecular mechanism by which LSD1 endorses the oncogenesis of OEC has not been fully understood. Here, we revealed that overexpression of LSD1 downregulated Forkhead box O 3a (FOXO3a), while knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 upregulated FOXO3a expression. Specifically, LSD1 interacted with demethylated FOXO3a. The LSD1-demethylated FOXO3a degraded via an ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Biologically, LSD1 destabilized FOXO3a to abrogate its functions in the suppression of soft agar colony and cell proliferation formation in HO8910 ovarian cancer cells. Knockdown of FOXO3a rescued the restricted cell proliferation by LSD1 downregulation. As a whole, our study clarifies a way in ovarian cancer cell growth through the negative regulation of FOXO3a by LSD1."
499,Effect of 4-(methymercapto) benzaldehyde (MTAD) pretreatment on microtensile bond strengths of two resin cements on dentin surface,2020-04-01,"The aim of this study, as pretreated by MTAD, is to evaluate the resin adhesive strength. Samples were divided four groups: untreated dentin, dentin surface treated with tri-steamed water, dentin surface treated with phosphoric acid, dentin surface treated with EDTA, and dentin surface treated with MTAD. These were then glued to the pulp using two resins: Panavia F 2.0 and Relyx Unicem. This setup was is placed in water and divided and then It subjected to SEM characterization. The binding strength of MTAD-treated teeth was higher than that of the other three groups. After MTAD treatment, the adhesive force of the two resins on the tooth surface was greatly enhanced."
500,Outcome analysis of various bearing surface materials used in total hip replacement,2020-03-01,"Since the first total hip replacement (THR) in 1938 by Philip Wiles, prosthesis materials and THR surgical technologies have developed rapidly. In this review, we use internationally-published research to synthesize a comprehensive analysis of the specific characteristics and clinical outcomes of different bearing surfaces used in THR. Polyethylene, metallic alloys, and ceramic have become the three most commonly used hip prosthesis bearing surfaces after decades of hip implant development. Different bearing surface types have varying characteristics that offer specific benefits and risks of complication. A thorough understanding of the unique properties and possible complications of each type of bearing surface is critical to surgeons tasked with selecting appropriate implant materials for total hip replacement."
501,Adsorption of methylene blue and rhodamine B on graphene oxide-FeO nanocomposite: Molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations,2020-03-01,"Graphene oxide based magnetic nanocomposite (GO-Fe3O4) was synthesized using the coprecipitation method. Intercalation of nanoparticles has resulted in the modified interlayer spacing of GO sheets, it is increased from 0.82 to 1.11 nm. Nanocomposite was characterized using TEM, AFM, XRD, UV-Visible and Raman spectroscopy. Magnetic nanocomposite is tested for removal of industrial dyes MB and RB through the adsorption process. The adsorbent dosage, dye concentration, and adsorption time are optimized in an optimal condition in the dye removal experiments (0.1 g/L adsorbent (GO), 10 mg/L of MB and RB with 25 minutes adsorption time). Adsorption capacity of 100 and 80 mg/g was achieved for MB and RB respectively. Preferential behavior of nanocomposite towards MB over RB can be attributed to the differential electrostatic and geometrical interactions. Differential behavior towards adsorption of dyes is further studied by Monte Carlo adsorption locator and molecular dynamics simulations. Adsorption energies corresponding to MB/GO, RB/GO, MB/Fe3O4, and RB/Fe3O4 systems show that certain configurations favor adsorption on GO and Fe3O4 surfaces. Radial distribution function calculation shows the geometric separation of 2.23 and 5.13 Å for MB and RB respectively, which has profound effect on electrostatic and π-π interaction."
502,"The influence of hot extrusion deformation on microstructure evolution, tensile properties and corrosion behavior of Mg–3Al–0.5Mn–0.5Sr alloy",2020-03-01,"A novel microalloyed Mg–3Al–0.5Mn–0.5Sr (AMJ300) alloy was designed and prepared. Then the original structure of as-cast alloy was optimized by hot extrusion. The influence of extrusion on microstructure, corrosion and tensile properties of as-cast AMJ300 alloy were studied by OM, SEM, EDS, XRD, TEM, electrochemical workstation and tensile tests. The results indicated that α-Mg, Al8Mn5 and Al4Sr phases constitute the AMJ300 alloy. Furthermore, the microstructure of alloy was further refined after extrusion, which indicates that the microstructural evolution during extrusion was governed by dynamic recrystallization. The fine and close of structure and the morphology change of intermetallic compounds greatly improved the corrosion resistance of AMJ300 alloy. The results of corrosion rate, corrosion current and corrosion morphology showed that the corrosion resistance of as-cast alloy could be significantly improved by extrusion. The main corrosion products of AMJ300 alloy in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution was Mg(OH)2. After extrusion, the tensile properties of AMJ300 alloy was significantly improved. The tensile strength reached 349 MPa, the yield strength reached 229 MPa, and the elongation reached 13.2%. Compared with the as-cast alloy, the tensile strength, the yield strength and the elongation increased by 218.1%, 248.9% and 173.7% respectively"
503,Uncoupling protein 2 facilitates insulin-elicited protection against lipopolysaccharide-induced myocardial dysfunction,2020-03-01,"Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction is a critical cause of high mortality among patients with sepsis. Previously, insulin has been suggested to protect against lethal endotoxemia, while uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) has been reported to exert beneficial effects against sepsis. Thus, this study aimed to investigate whether UCP2 is involved in insulin-elicited protection against myocardial dysfunction in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. Treatment of male SD rats with insulin for 30 min before LPS challenge improved the survival and cardiac function in endotoxemic rats, which was likely due to an insulin-dependent reduction of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and cardiac troponin T (cTn-T) levels, mitochondrial oxidative stress, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Insulin treatment also increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, prevented the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, and reduced cleaved caspase-9 levels, which was determined by purifying the proteins using the His-tag Magnetic Bead Purification Kit (Fe3O4). Moreover, UCP2 was found to be upregulated in endotoxemic rats which were pretreated with insulin. To determine whether the apoptotic role of insulin is associated with UCP2 upregulation, we examined the effects of genipin, a UCP2 inhibitor, on insulin activity in LPS-treated H9c2 cells. Insulin strongly attenuated LPS-induced H9c2 cell apoptosis and stimulated UCP2 expression. However, genipin treatment eliminated the antiapoptotic effects of insulin. Thus, our results demonstrate that insulin-induced UCP2 upregulation plays a role in the protective effect of insulin against LPS-induced myocardial dysfunction."
504,Evaluation of a recombinant bacillus calmette-guérin vaccine expressing P39-L7/L12 of : An immunization strategy against brucellosis in BALB/c mice,2020-03-01,"Brucellosis is a chronic infectious disease caused by bacteria from the genus Brucella. It has a serious global economic impact, and poses a threat to public health. Ideally, vaccines should exhibit a safe profile as well as enhanced protective efficacy. However, there are no licensed vaccines available for humans against brucellosis. In this study, for the first time, a recombinant BCG (rBCG) vaccine expressing the P39-L7/12 fusion protein of Brucella melitensis against brucellosis was constructed. The rBCG vaccine elicited strong antigen-specific humoral and T cell-mediated immunity in vivo. The rBCG vaccine also induced a significant level of protection following challenge with a virulent strain of B. melitensis M28 in BALB/c mice. Furthermore, the protection level induced by the rBCG vaccine was significantly higher than that induced by BCG. Collectively, these results suggested that rBCG vaccine acted as a suitable vaccine candidate and a new strategy against human brucellosis."
505,Inhibitory effect of glucocorticoid receptor on colorectal cancer growth by inhibiting glycolysis through autophagy,2020-03-01,"Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) affects the development and progression of most malignant tumors by regulating autophagy. The GR gene is not expressed in colon cancer. To explore the role and mechanism of GR in colon cancer, dexamethasone (DXM) was used to stimulate the expression of GR. The expression of the autophagy markers Beclin 1 (BECN1) and light chain 3 (LC3B) was then detected by qRT-PCR and western blotting. The effects of the differential expression of GR on autophagy, ATP, lactic acid accumulation, and glucose utilization in colon cancer cells were studied. Differential expression of GR affected glycolysis, apoptosis, and migration of colon cancer cells, as determined by flow cytometry and cell viability and migration assays, respectively. The DXM-induced elevation of GR expression significantly promoted the expression of the autophagy-related genes BECN1 and LC3B, and decreased the ATP production, lactic acid accumulation, and glucose uptake in colon cancer cells. These events resulted in the inhibition of colon cancer cell growth, which also involved decreased cell viability and mobility and increased rate of apoptosis. These findings indicate that the GR can promote autophagy and inhibit glycolysis in colon cancer cells, reduce their proliferation and migration, and promote their apoptosis in vitro."
506,Development of cationic polymer-based nanoplatform for insulin delivery and diabetes treatment,2020-03-01,"Due to the high molecular weight, hydrophilicity, and pH/enzyme sensitivity of proteins, effectively delivery of therapeutic proteins remains many difficulties. In this study, a novel nanoplatform for insulin delivery was established, in which a kind of tunable cationic polymer based on arginine was chosen as the nanocarrier. The nanocomplexes were formed with the cationic polymers and insulin under the electrostatic reactions. Then the relationship between the chemical structure of polymers and physicochemical properties of nanocomplex was systematically investigated among the particle size, surface charge, cytotoxicity, cellular internalization ability and finally therapeutic effects. It was confirmed that the structure of polymers affected their hydrophobicity, subsequently influencing the physicochemical properties of nanocomplex and further the therapeutic effects of nanocomplex. The in vivo results also proved that the suitable polymer with an optimal weight ratio of materials and proteins could obtain a promising therapeutic effect on Type 1 diabetes."

Among them, MCP(1,3-Bis(carbazol-9-yl)benzene) was used as the main material for the blue light layer, FIrPic(Bis(3,5-difluoro)-2-(2-pyridyl)phenyl-(2-carboxypyridyl)iridium(III)) as the phosphorescent object material, and Rubrene(5,6,11,12-Tetraphenylnaphthacene) as the fluorescent material for the yellow light layer. The device structure is NPB(N,N′-Bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)-benzidine) (20 nm)/Rubrene (0.5 nm)/MCP (3 nm)/MCP: FIrPic (30 nm, 10%)/Rubrene (z nm)/TPBi(1,3,5-Tris(1-phenyl-1Hbenzimidazol-2-yl) benzene)(10 nm)/Alq3(20 nm/LiF (0.6 nm)/Al (100 nm). By adjusting the thickness of Rubrene, the structure of the device was optimized and the performance of the device was improved. When the thickness of Rubrene was 0.5 nm, the performance of the device was the best, the maximum efficiency was 6.41 cd/A, the maximum luminance was 8344 cd/m2. When the driving voltage changed from 5 V to 14 V, the device changed from warm white light to cold white light."
508,Study on the anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering activities of novel chimeric peptide,2020-03-01,"Acne was treated by combining the N-terminal of HPA3NT3 (where Lys in position 13 was replaced by Asn) and the C-terminal antibacterial peptide HAG of GLP-1 (32–36) amide pentapeptide after amino replacement. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was measured using the broth dilution method to evaluate HAG’s antibacterial activity. HAG’s cytotoxicity was determined using water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1). Interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression in human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) cells stimulated by Propionibacterium acnes and treated with HAG was measured by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). IL-8 and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression was detected using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) to analyze HAG’s anti-inflammatory effect in vitro. The total RNA was extracted using SiO2 nanoparticles. Oil red O staining was used to detect the intracellular lipid drop of Sebaceous Gland Cell Line (SZ95), and ELISA was used to detect triglyceride levels. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was used to evaluate ear edema induced by Propionibacterium acne in mice. The MIC of HAG in Propionibacterium acnes was 6.3 μg/mL, and 50 μg/mL of HAG showed cytotoxicity. HAG significantly reduced TLR2 and IL-8 expression in HaCaT cells. Oil red O staining showed that the lipid distribution of HAG-treated SZ95 and triglyceride secretion decreased. HAG reduced ear swelling induced by Propionibacterium acnes. HAG has anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory effects, excellent hypolipidemic function, and low cytotoxicity. Further development of HAG could be a promising and effective reagent for acne therapy."

The aim of this study was to identify exosomal miRNAs involved in OSAS and to determine their relative functions. Serum exosomal miRNA-expression patterns in pediatric OSAS patients and healthy donors were analyzed comprehensively via RNA sequencing, and differently expressed miRNAs were verified using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The effect of the miRNAs on cell culture was measured by flow cytometry. Results revealed that 364 and 464 miRNAs were identified in normal and OSAS exosomes, respectively. Moreover, exosomal miR-664a-3p, miR-210, miR-21-3p, and miR-107 were significantly more downregulated in exosomes from OSAS than in those of healthy controls. These downregulated miRNAs were mainly involved in functions involving cell cycle, immune response, and cell proliferation and adhesion as well as pathways associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase, Wnt, and mammalian target rapamycin signaling. Furthermore, miR-107 promoted the arrest of the adenoid lymphocyte cycle at the G2/M phase. These data revealed several potential exosomal miRNA biomarkers and their associated functions and pathways. This study advanced the knowledge of OSAS exosome biology to facilitate the development of OSAS-specific exosome-based diagnostics and therapeutics."
511,Detection of resistance genes from  using immunomagnetic isolation and chemiluminescence,2020-03-01,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is a common opportunistic and nosocomial bacterial pathogen. Various multi-resistance mechanisms present across numerous P. aeruginosa strains counteract conventional antimicrobial therapy, thereby becoming a great challenge. This study aimed to establish the application of immunomagnetic isolation and chemiluminescence to detect the presence of extended spectra of β-lactamases encoding genes: blaTEM and blaVEB; metallo-beta-lactamases encoding gene: blaVIM; aminoglycoside modifying enzymes encoding gene: aac(6)II, ant(3)I; and the specific gene for P. aeruginosa, gyrB. P. aeruginosa was specifically selected using the immunomagnetic nanoparticles (IMNPs) in the six parallel bacterial plates counting, proving that they are reliable. Then, the high efficiency of [email protected] in targeting the resistance genes of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated using the results of chemiluminescent intensities of blaTEM, blaVEB, blaVIM aac(6)II, ant(3)I, and gyrB (more than 10 times higher than that of the control). Sixty-eight in situ clinical samples were tested for the presence of these resistance genes, and one more blaTEM and three more blaVIM individuals were detected using this method compared to the traditional PCR. Thus, the application of our method in clinical screening is specific, accurate, and reliable, and it could be useful in the administration of appropriate treatment."
512,Structural characteristics and physicochemical properties of fresh-water fish gelatins with different molecular weights and their potential application to food capsule film fabrication,2020-03-01,"This work is aimed to investigate the effects of molecular weights on physicochemical properties of fish gelatins and their potential application to food capsule film fabrication. Firstly, high/medium/low component fish gelatins (HCG/MCG/LCG) were obtained by ultrafiltration. Physicochemical property assay results showed that high molecular weight content of gelatin contributed to the increase in gelling strength, viscosity, melting point, and denaturation temperature due to extensive inter–intra molecular interactions. Meanwhile, parameters (temperature, weight ratio, and drying time) had been comprehensively investigated to determine the effects of three molecular weights of gelatins on capsule film manufacture. MCG-derived capsule film was found to achieve good balance among tensile strength, elongation at break, and dissolution rate constant. Furthermore, 90-day acceleration storage stability experiment suggested that MCG showed an appropriate ɛ-amino acid residue content and crosslink density. This work provides a comprehensive insight into the effect of molecular weights on physicochemical properties of fish gelatins and their application in food capsule film manufacture."
513,Hydration and microstructure of concrete containing high volume lithium slag,2020-03-01,"Due to requirements for environmental protection, saving of resources and sustainable construction in the future, investigation on the use of high volume mineral admixtures as supplementary cementitious materials in concrete was carried out in this study. The effect of high volume lithium slag (LS) to partially replace cement by weight on compressive strengths of concrete was experimentally investigated, and the hydration of hardened paste was measured by non-evaporable water. Moreover, the microstructure of concrete was determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry and scanning electron microscope methods. Results showed that the use of high volume LS reduced compressive strengths of concrete at early ages, and compressive strengths were remarkably improved at later ages, with concrete containing 40% LS being close to that of the control concrete. Hydration of hardened paste showed similar variation trends with compressive strengths. The highvolume LS degraded concrete microstructure at early ages, and 40% LS improved concrete microstructure at the later ages, due to the filling effect and pozzolanic reaction of LS. However, there still existed defects in microstructure of concrete containing 60% LS, with increased harmful porosity, especially interfacial transition zone."

Moreover, the scaffolds improved partial motor function of double-hindlimb on a macro level. Overall, the fibrin scaffolds embedded with SHH/CS microspheres showed more satisfactory effect on nerve regeneration, tissue cavities prevention and motor function improvement, compared to fibrin scaffolds with SHH directly encapsulated into or fibrin scaffolds alone."
515,Effect of siRNA interference of ubiquitin-specific protease 9X on apoptosis and growth of diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell line,2020-03-01,"Ubiquitin-specific protease 9X (USP9X) is crucial in the diagnosis and treatment of many tumor types, but its role in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) has not been determined. The current study aimed to examine the effects of RNA interference on USP9X expression, and subsequently on the bioactivity of DLBCL Farage and Pfeiffer cells. There were two groups in the study: USP9X-siRNA and NC. USP9X siRNA was transiently transferred into DLBCL cells by Cationic liposome. The total RNA was extracted using Fe2O3 and was retrieved into the DNA using the MagBeads Total RNA Extraction Kit. The protein expression of USP9X in Farage, Pfeiffer, and normal human B cell line at the cellular level was observed by Western blot. The Farage and Pfeiffer cells were infected with USP9X-siRNA. Cell apoptosis and cell growth viability were analyzed by flow cytometry and CCK8, Mcl-1 protein, a potential target of USP9X, and apoptosis factor proteins (such as Bak, Cytochrome C, Caspase 3, Caspase 8, PARP) were detected by Western blot after siRNA interference. The results showed that the protein expression of USP9X in malignant B cells was four times higher than that of the normal B cells. Inhibition of USP9X reduced the Mcl-1 activity, and increased the caspase-3, Bak and Cytochrome C activity. In the malignant B cells, Mcl-1 and Bak were binding in vivo; Bak was a new partner of Mcl-1. Inhibition of USP9X reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. The expression of USP9X is upregulated in Diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells, Farage, and Pfeiffer. Inhibition expression of USP9X may induce cell apoptosis, inhibit cell growth, and downregulate Mcl-1 protein expression in Diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells, Farage, and Pfeiffer. USP9X has the ability in regulating cell apoptosis."

RADA16-1 assembled short-peptide nano-fiber gel scaffold was prepared using the ultrasonic method. Twenty female SD rats were randomly divided into two groups. Burn model was established using the electrical machinery method. The wound surface of the rats in the experimental group was coated with RADA16-1 and that of the rats in the control group was coated with NaCl. The degree of wound healing, hair follicle growth, hair growth length, and expression of bFGF and EGF were compared between the two groups. RADA16-1 fibers were broken into short fibers under the ultrasonic environment and then reorganized into gels.

517,Study on the transfer and anchorage length of steel strand in ultra high performance concrete material,2020-02-01,"Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) material, a new type of cement-based composite material, is usually employed in the bridge engineering. The transfer and anchorage length of steel strand in UHPC material is different from that in ordinary concrete; nevertheless, few design standards are found that how to anchor the transfer and anchoring length of steel strand in UHPC material under normal curing. Through central pull-out test under the different conditions of protective layer thickness and embedded length, the load-slip curves, failure modes, and bond strength of 36 UHPC material specimens under normal curing were studied. The experimental results showed that the ultimate bond stress between UHPC material and steel strand under natural curing conditions is 7.01∼11.68 MPa. When the compressive strength of cube was 157 MPa; the bond strength under natural curing was smaller than that under thermal curing; when the thickness of the protective layer of steel strand with a diameter of 15.2 mm is greater than 30 mm, it had a little influence on bond strength. The regression analysis of the test results based on the experimental results proves that the recommended formulas for the design of transfer length and anchorage length of steel strand in UHPC material were in great agreement with the results of published studies."
518,Tension–compression asymmetry of bilayer Ni/NiAl affected by dislocation formation–decomposition and twinning size,2020-02-01,"Molecular dynamics simulations were used to study the tensile and compressive properties of bilayer Ni/ Ni3Al. We found that: the tension–compression asymmetry behaviours of bilayer Ni/Ni3Al with different crystal orientations are different. The tension–compression asymmetry of different crystal orientations is result from different origins. For [001] crystal orientation, the formation of face angle dislocation in the γ' phase during tension, and no formation of face angle dislocation when compressed result in asymmetry. The reason for the [011] crystal orientation asymmetry is the twinning, and the twinning region during tension is larger than when it is compressed. [111] crystal orientation asymmetry is due to super dislocation decomposition. When dislocation is formed, the fault dislocation area during tension is smaller than that during compression, which results in the ability of preventing cross-slip when tension less than the compression state. The cross-slip is formed during tension, and the cross-slip does not occur during compression, exhibiting different tension–compression asymmetry behaviours. This study will provide theoretical guidance for the application of Ni-based single crystal alloys and further enhancement of their mechanical properties."
519,Combined study on the action and mechanism of G-Rg1/Sr-CaS bone substitute material for ossification and pro-vascularization,2020-02-01,"Neovascularization is important for bone repair, vascularization, and ossification during bone repair. Ginsenoside Rg1 (G-Rg1), which is the main extract of ginseng, has been shown to promote therapeutic angiogenesis. It has been studied in the field of biomaterials, but there is no relevant report in the field of bone substitute materials. In this study, we successfully prepared the bone substitute material combining calcium sulphate (Sr-CaS) with G-Rg1 on the basis of previous research work. In vitro experiments were carried out to verify the ossification of composites by using mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) and the ossification was quantified by western blot. The related proteins in the key signaling pathways for the different concentrations of G-Rg1/Sr-CaS composite extract were studied to determine whether there was receptor competition and to find the optimal ratio parameters. The vascularization of the composite was verified in the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) model, and finally the coordination of pro-vascularization and ossification was evaluated in the mouse critical bone defect model. The results indicated that G-Rg1/Sr-CaS composites contributed to ossification in the mouse BMMSC model and vascularization in the HUVEC model. The G-Rg1/Sr-CaS composites resulted in significantly greater bone mineral densities and bone volume/total volume of the defect group compared to the control group. Histological analysis showed that the G-Rg1/SrCaS was resorbable with satisfactory biocompatibility. The doped strontium ions enhanced the bone repair performance of G-Rg1/Sr-CaS in the mouse model and the new substitute demonstrated promising results for clinical use."

522,A novel electrochemical DNA detection method based on bio-barcode/gold label silver stain dual amplification,2020-02-01,"A novel electrochemical gene detection method based on bio-barcode/gold label silver stain (GLSS) dual amplification is presented. The silica nanoparticle/gold nanoparticles (SiO2/AuNPs) barcode probes were constructed by combining SiO2 nanoparticle-labeled DNA with AuNPs, which hybridizes with target DNAs and the electrode surface-modified DNA probes. The silver ions were reduced on the surface of AuNPs to form a silver shell by the catalysis of AuNPs, and then the electrochemical detection of deposited silver was performed by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV).

Herein, bentonite-based PCMs were synthesized by impregnating Na-bentonite clay with lauric acid (LA) through a vacuum impregnation method. Flake graphite (FG) was used to enhance the thermal conductivity of the composite PCMs. In addition, FG also helped block the leakage of the PCMs. It is worth noting that with the addition of FG, the period of melting and solidifying of composite PCMs were decreased to some extent. Meanwhile, the thermal conductivity of the PCMs has been obviously improved. Moreover, the synthesized composite PCM exhibited a favorable performance of reliability after 200 thermocycling test. Hence, this study showed that the developed composite PCM has the potential to be applied in thermal energy storage systems."

525,Role of miR-139-5p in relieving renal allograft ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting c-Jun NH-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway,2020-02-01,"Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury cannot be avoided in the process of kidney transplants. In this study, the role of miR-139-5p in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice was investigated. Hyperuricemia cells were detected using qPCR. The results confirm that the expression levels of miR-139-5p, Jun, and c-Jun were detected, and miR-139-5p was down-regulated in the ischemia-reperfusion injury after renal transplantation, while CDK4 and Jun were up-regulated. The levels of [Ca++]i and ROO were measured in HK-2 cells, and it was determined that overexpression of miR-139-5p reduced these levels to approach a normal state. After cell silencing of miR139-5p, the levels of [Ca++]i and ROO of the hyperuricemia cells increased significantly. After down-regulation of miR-139-5p via CCK-8 and clonal cell formation assays, it was determined that the survival rate and viability of hyperuricemia cells were decreased significantly. However, the addition of the agent anisomycin (JNK activation) improved the survival rate of hyperuricemia cells and increased their viability. The detection of the cycle of the hyperuricemia cells revealed that the up-regulation of miR-139-5p blocked a large number of cells in the G1 phase; however, the number of these cells significantly decreased after the addition of anisomycin. The expression levels of c-Jun and JNK in hyperuricemia cells were detected via immunofluorescence. In the hyperuricemia cells, the fluorescence intensity in the miR-139-5p overexpression group was higher compared to that in the control group. Moreover, the fluorescence intensity decreased significantly after the addition of anisomycin. Nano-magnetic beads were fabricated and used to extract high purity RNA. Scanning electron microscopy was used to confirm the efficacy of the nanoparticles in the extraction of RNA. The detection of the JNK pathway-related proteins of hyperuricemia cells using qPCR and Western blot revealed that the downregulation of miR-139-5p promoted the expression of JNK pathway-related proteins while the up-regulation of miR-139-5p inhibited the expression levels of c-jun, JNK, JNK 1, and JNK 2. The experimental results indicate that miR-139-5p alleviates renal–renal ischemia-reperfusion injury by targeting Jun-mediated JNK signaling pathways."
526,Correlation of neuropeptides substance P and neuropeptide Y and their receptors with fracture healing in rats,2020-02-01,"Bone fracture healing is a complex process involving a cascade of cellular and molecular events that are orchestrated by a variety of factors, including neuropeptides and their receptors. However, the roles of neuropeptides and their receptors in the fracture healing process are controversial. We monitored the expression and distribution of the neuropeptides, substance P (SP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) and their receptors, neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1) and neuropeptide Y1 receptor (NPY1R), in rats undergoing fracture healing. Total RNA was extracted using Fe3O4 and was retrieved into DNA using the MagBeads Total RNA Extraction Kit. The expression levels of SP, NK1, and NPY at each time point in the healing bone tissue were found to be higher than the levels in normal bone tissue. Their location and expression levels correlated with the healing process. In the callus formation stage, the expression levels of SP, NK1, and NPY were found to be increased in the matrix of the cartilage, in chondrocytes, and in the subperiosteal region. At the bone remodeling stage, they were located in the periosteum, new bone tissue, and perivascular regions, and their expression levels gradually reduced. Therefore, we conclude that SP was involved in callus formation and bone resorption at different physiological concentrations. At some concentrations, SP positively regulated new bone formation via NK1. At other concentrations, the SP-NK1 interaction promoted bone resorption. Very low expression levels of NPY1R were observed at the early healing stage, but they increased at the middle stage and then decreased at the late stage. This indicated that NPY was involved in bone formation through NPY1R-unrelated mechanisms. NPY1R was more involved at the later stage of bone remodeling, according to its expression levels. NPY1R contributed to callus formation and remodeling."

The optimum specific surface area of the silica nanoparticles before modification was 289.2 m2 g–1. After modification, the intrinsic properties of the fluorescent silica nanoparticles were studied, and the results showed that they were in their amorphous phase, with a particle size of 5–10 nm. We proposed that the interaction between R-6G and the silica nanoparticle surface was due to the hydrogen bonding, using the results from the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The obtained fluorescent silica nanoparticles had excellent fluorescence enhancement of 2-fold compared to R-6G in its original state. This study reports, for the first time, the synthesis of fluorescent nanoparticles from geothermal silica and its ability to visualize latent fingerprints on different smooth dry surfaces, making it an excellent candidate for fluorescent powders in forensic applications."

In this research, the surface area and microstructure of microwave activated CRM and high-temperature performance of CRM asphalt were investigated to characterize the mechanism of interaction between activated CRM blends added and base asphalt. The surface area and microstructure of CRM were measured by gas adsorption method and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) respectively when CRM was activated using microwave treatment time (30 s, 60 s, 90 s, 120 s and 150 s). The complex shear modulus (G*) and the phase angle (δ) of the CRM asphalt were measured by Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) test. The results indicated that microwave treatment produced more porous structure and agglomeration phenomenon than control one for a given activated time of CRM. The flocculent structure was the most obvious one and agglomeration phenomenon was the most significant one for the particle surface microwave activated 90 s. The δ decreased and G* increased as CRM blends activated time increased before a certain time using the same frequency of microwave treatment. The G*/sinδ of CRM blends was the maximum when CRM activated for 90 s using microwave treatment. Both surface area and microstructure of the CRM influenced the high-temperature performance of CRM binders."
531,Electrochemical immunosensor for a protein biomarker based on the formation of Prussian blue with magnetic nanoparticle,2020-02-01,"An electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of protein biomarkers is reported herein based on using magnetic nanoparticles (MNs) as labels. Reaction of potassium ferrocyanide with MNs leads to in situ formation of Prussian blue (PB) on the MN surface, generating an electrochemical current. A carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was chosen as a model protein biomarker to test the performance of the immunosensor. The immunosensor was prepared based on a traditional sandwich-type structure. A high concentration of CEA increased the number of MNs captured on the electrode, which increased the amount of PB produced, thus increasing the electrochemical current intensity. The current intensity linearly increased with the concentration of CEA in the range from 0.05 to 10 ng/mL. The potential clinical applicability of this immunosensor was demonstrated by CEA detection in human serum samples."
532,Rapid detection of  using cytotoxin-associated gene A based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay and magnetic nanoparticles,2020-02-01,"The current methods for detecting Helicobacter pylori infection are time-consuming and have relatively low sensitivity. More appropriate tests are needed. A rapid, specific, and sensitive method was presently developed to detect the cytotoxin-associated gene A (cagA) of H. pylori. Genomic DNA was extracted using magnetic nanoparticles and then amplified by the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction using primers we designed. To assess the diagnostic value of the LAMP assay in detecting H. pylori cagA, agarose gel electrophoresis as well as detection of fluorescence intensity after adding fluorescent dye were done. Specificity analysis showed that 11 pathogenic bacterial strains common in human gut were negative for cagA, with a positive result obtained only for H. pylori. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated a cagA detection limit of 100 fg. The results were consistent with that of the 3C-urea breath test. The novel LAMP assay can directly identify H. pylori cagA in the gastric juice of clinical patients with high sensitivity and specificity. The comparatively more rapid and more sensitive method may be valuable for clinical applications."

The Schiff base (L = TSCPA) was formed by the condensation of thiosemicarbazide and phthalic anhydride in acetic acid. The microanalytical analysis confirmed the 1:1 (metal: ligand) molar ratio. Magnetic susceptibility and electronic absorption spectra were suggested that the Fe(III) and Co(II) complexes were octahedral structure but the Mn(II) and Cu(II) complexes were tetrahedral geometry. FTIR spectra reveal that the ligand exists, predominantly, as keto form in a solid state but as enol form in the alkaline medium. The coordination between TSCPA chelate and central metal ions take place through nitrogen –NH, sulphur C=S and oxygen –OH groups. Based on the molar conductance measurements the complexes may be formulated as [Mn(L)(H2O)] · 4H2O, [Fe(L)(Cl)(H2O)2] · 2H2O, [Co(L)(H2O)3] · 3H2O and [Cu(L)(H2O)] · 4H2O due to their non-electrolytic behavior.

534,Preparation and high-temperature properties of 6H-SiC/MWCNT/silicon resin composites,2020-01-01,"Microwave absorbing materials (MAMs) have been widely used in the military and industrial fields. Recently, considerable efforts have been made to develop hybrid composition, multilayer structure absorbers to meet requirements such as strong absorption characteristics, wide absorption frequencies, light weights and oxidation resistance. In this study, a series of flexible composites consisting of 6H-SiC powder (40–50 wt.%), silicon resin (60–50 wt.%) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs, additional 0.05–0.2 wt.%) were prepared and applied to produce high-temperature microwave absorbers via the spray coating method. The prepared composites were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the microwave absorbing properties of the composites were measured in the 4–18 GHz frequency range by the free space measurement method. The TGA thermograms indicated that the thermal stabilities of the prepared composites increased with increases in the 6H-SiC content but were less affected by increases in the MWCNT content. The actual measurement results showed that the optimum composition was 50 wt.% 6H-SiC, 50 wt.% silicon resin and an additional 0.2 wt.% MWCNT. The minimum reflection loss (RL) value of –58.9 dB was observed at 9.7 GHz with a thickness of 1.6 mm, and the effective absorption bandwidth (RL < –10 dB, for 90% microwave absorption) reached 2.3 GHz. At a high temperature of 450 °C, the absorption peak was located at 10.0 GHz with a reflection loss of – 13.7 dB, and the effective frequency bandwidth still reached 1.6 GHz."

For this study, nano-silica in different proportions of 1, 2 and 3% was used. The M40 grade of SCC with a total of four mixes inclusive of control concrete was prepared. The fresh state workability of SCC was assessed by conducting the slump flow, L-box test, V-funnel test, Orimet and J-ring tests. Hardened concrete test like tensile strength was also carried out. The durability tests on permeability properties like water absorption, porosity, sorptivity, rapid chloride penetration and sulfate resistance test were determined at the age of 7, 28, 90 and 180 days. The tensile strength showed 18.82% greater strength for 2% nano-silica compared to the control mix.

The Ga-doped ZnO nanowires interconnected with disks were grown over p-Si substrate and studied by numerous techniques to understand the structural, compositional and morphological characteristics. Electrical properties, at lowtemperatures ranging from 77 K–295 K, were examined for the fabricated heterojunction diode assembly both in reverse and forward biased conditions which exhibited an excellent stability over all the temperature range. The detailed electrical characterizations revealed that the current decreases gradually from 1.9 μA, to 0.87 μA to 0.84 μA when temperature increases from 77 K, 100 K to 150 K and then increases gradually from 1.86 μA–3.36 μA and to 9.95 μA when temperature increases from 200 K–250 K and to 295 K, respectively. Both the highest rectifying ratio at 100 K and the lowest one at 295 K occur in the voltage range of 2–5 V."

Horizontal quartz tube thermal evaporation technique was used for the growth of ZnO nanorods on Si substrate. The nanorods were characterized by several techniques to examine the structural, morphological, scattering and electrical properties. Wurtzite hexagonal phase of the grown aligned nanorods was observed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The appearance of a sharp Raman peak at 438 cm–1 was observed and it is related to the E 2(high) mode of the wurtzite hexagonal phase of ZnO. The electrical properties of the fabricated heterojunction assembly were examined at different temperatures (298∼398 K) in both reverse and forward biased conditions, and a good stability was observed over the entire temperature range. A reduction in the turn-on and breakdown voltage was observed with increasing temperature. By increasing the temperature, the effective potential barrier height was increased, while quality factor was decreased. The observed activation energy was found to be ∼93.4 meV, higher than the exciton binding energy of ZnO."

The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) procedures and specific surface area and zeta potential determination were applied to describe the structure of Fe3O4/GP composite. The results shown the Fe3O4 particles, which fabricated during the solvothermal reaction, were distributed evenly on the surface of GP. Then Fe3O4/GP composite also presented a high level of magnetism, and thus could be separated quickly from suspension by an external magnet. The adsorption efficiencies of Fe3O4/GP for CR, HA, and P were 92.88%, 47.45%, and 99.02%, which were found uninfluenced by the initial solution pH and attained the equilibrium state within 10 min. The kinetic and isothermal tests were performed and the data were consistent with the pseudo-second-order kinetic equation and the Freundlich model."
539,Nanomixture: A new strategy to simultaneously deliver multiple natural bioactive compounds,2020-01-01,"Undesired adverse effects caused by chemodrugs cannot be neglected in antitumor therapy, and therefore, it is important to identify new medicines with desirable therapeutic efficacy and low toxicity to normal cells. A large number of natural extracts have been shown to have favorable therapeutic effects. In addition, the synergic interactions of multiple compounds are essential for antitumor activity. In this study, we propose a strategy to simultaneously deliver multiple antitumor compounds via a nanomixture and demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by delivering jujube polysaccharides (JPS) and curcumin (CUR) to CT26.WT cells. The experimental results indicate that increased uptake of nanoparticles and enhanced antitumor activity in vitro can be reached using our designed delivery system. This strategy could become a promising approach for drug delivery research."
540,Growth and characterization of -axis titled ZnO thin film by radio frequency magnetron sputtering,2020-01-01,"This work focuses on fabrication of c-axis tilted ZnO thin film which is used in FBAR biosensors to induce shear mode acoustic wave in the liquid environment. The ZnO thin film was deposited via using one-step method by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering with fixed inclined angle between the normal of the target and substrates. All the samples were investigated by the SEM, XRD and UV visible spectrophotometer. It is found that the motion states of substrates and angle of tilted target decide the inclined angle of crystals growth. The sputtering pressure affects the quality of column structure. The high sputtering pressure destroy the growth of column structure. Besides, the procedure of annealing is very important for optimizing the quality and orientation of crystals growth. The thin film deposited on the static substrates at low sputtering pressure (1.0 Pa) has preferred tilted c-axis orientation column structure. The tilted angle of c-axis is 13.6° and close to the value (13.1°) of theory formula. As for optical transmittance of samples, the optical band gap is decreased as sputtering pressure reduces."
541,Effect of electroacupuncture on dopaminergic neurons in a rat model of Parkinson's disease based on the -synuclein pathway,2020-01-01,"To explore the possibility of using electroacupuncture to prevent injury of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of rats with Parkinson's disease (PD), Wistar rats were randomly divided into a control group, model group, drug (Medoba) group, and an electroacupuncture group. Rotenone was injected into the right substantia nigra to induce a PD rat model with single side substantia nigra injury. A rotation behavior observation method was used to observe changes in rotation behavior and apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra after electroacupuncture. Total RNA was extracted using nano-magnetic beads and retrieved from the DNA using a MagBeads Total RNA Extraction Kit. Rotenone can induce PD symptoms in Wistar rats, and we explored the effect of electroacupuncture in improving these induced Parkinson's symptoms in PD rats. The effect was similar to that of Medoba. Electroacupuncture reduced the α-synuclein (α-SYN) levels in the substantia nigra of the PD rats to some extent. We concluded that the content and inhibition of aggregation electroacupuncture can protect dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of PD rats. Additionally, electroacupuncture can effectively prevent injury of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of rats with PD."
542,Interfacial characteristics between mineral fillers and phenolic resin in friction materials,2020-01-01,"Mineral fillers are indispensable constituent part of friction materials, which are capable of improving and stabilizing coefficient of friction, decreasing wear, enhancing thermal conductivity and reducing costs of friction materials, in addition, decreasing the noise in brake application. Based on their roles in the friction materials, mineral fillers are classified into abrasives, lubricants, functional fillers, and space fillers. Herein, four typical commercial mineral fillers, namely quartz, graphite, expanded vermiculite, and barite were studied for revealing their effects on the performance of friction materials. The composition, thermal stability, structural characteristics such as surface area, pore volume, and distribution of the pore size, and thermal conductivity of these mineral fillers were researched mainly by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry (DSC-TG), N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, and thermal conductivity tester. Moreover, in order to illustrate the interfacial characteristics of mineral-based in friction materials, four ideal brake pads only consisting of mineral filler, BaSO4 and phenolic resin were prepared. Microstructure and combination of mineral fillers and phenolic resin were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), polarizing microscope, and Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results showed that different types of material fillers had special functions for friction materials, and they combined with phenolic resin mainly in a physical way."
543,Effect of cryogenic and wet coolant performance on drilling of super duplex stainless steel (2507),2020-01-01,"In this experimental study, the cutting performance of solid carbide twist drill with wet and cryogenic cooling (LN2) was analysed for super duplex stainless steel 2507 (SDSS 2507). The drilling test was conducted at three different levels of cutting velocity (40, 50 and 60 m/min), feed rate (0.03, 0.05, 0.07 mm/rev) and constant drilling depth of 20 mm. The output response of cutting forces, torque, surface roughness, temperature, microhardness and tool wear was observed on both the condition while drilling super duplex stainless steel (2507). The experimental result reveals that the cryogenic coolant (LN2) reduces the cutting temperature for about 27.66–55.74% than wet cooling condition. With increased feed rate the thrust force and torque increases and related to increase in the cutting velocity the thrust force and torque reduced for both wet and cryogenic (LN2) conditions. The surface finish of the drilled hole was enhanced in cryogenic condition against wet condition. The minimum amount of flank wear was observed in the cryogenic condition through a scanning electron microscope (SEM)."
544,Phenotype and genotype heterogeneous resistance of L-forms of  by magnetic nanoparticle,2020-01-01,"We studied factors influencing the phenotype and genotype heterogeneous resistance of L-forms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB-L). Three hundred patients with tuberculosis admitted to the Sixth People's Hospital of Nantong from 2014 to 2016 were selected. MTB-L was cultured and rifampicin (RFP) susceptibility was tested using sputum samples. The magnetic nanoparticle was used to extract the DNA of samples. DNA sequencing was used to detect the mutation of the rpoB gene core region for isolated MTB-L strains and heterogeneous resistance was analyzed. A total of 126 MTB-L strains were isolated from the sputum samples of 300 tuberculosis patients. No mutation in the core region of the rpoB gene was detected in 56 RFP-sensitive MTB-L strains. Among 70 phenotypically resistant strains, 32 had mutations in the core region of the rpoB gene, with amino acid changes at sites 511, 516, 526, and 531. No rpoB gene mutation was found in the other 38 phenotypic drug-resistant strains. The MTB-L phenotype and genotype displayed a certain degree of heterogeneous resistance. Changes in cell membrane structure is one important reason. The duration of disease, medication history, and structural changes of the lung are important factors."
545,miR-222 targets VGLL4 to promote growth of tongue squamous cell carcinoma,2020-01-01,"We investigated whether regulation of VGLL4 by miR-222 affects proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis in human tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) cells. Nanometer Magnetic beads were prepared to extract RNA in CAL27/human oral keratinocytes (HOK). Correlation between expression of miR-222 and VGLL4 in CAL27/human oral keratinocytes (HOK) was analyzed using RT-PCR and western blot. The cellular effects of miR-222/VGLL4 interactions were detected by cck8, transwell, and cell scratch assays, and flow cytometry after miR-222 was silenced or overexpressed in CAL27 cells. We assessed tumor growth in vivo, in a subcutaneous tumor model in mice, and assessed VGLL4 protein expression in tumors by immunohistochemistry. We found that miR-222 expression is higher in CAL27 cells than that in HOK cells. VGLL4 was highly expressed in HOK cells relative to CAL27 cells. When miR-222 was overexpressed, VGLL4 mRNA expression was reduced in CAL27 cells, and protein expression was reduced in the in vivo tumor model. Thus, miR-222 may down-regulate VGLL4 to promote proliferation, migration, and invasion of TSCC cells."
546,Effect of adiponectin on oxidative stress-apoptotic pathway in podocytes under high glucose conditions,2020-01-01,"To investigate the effect of adiponectin (APN) on the oxidative stress-apoptotic pathway of podocytes under high glucose conditions, podocytes were categorized into a control group (5.5 mmol/L, normal glucose, NG), high glucose group (30 mmol/L, high glucose, HG), and an APN intervention group (HG+APN). The expression of podocyte cytoskeleton proteins (nephrin/podocin/synaptopodin), p-AMPK activity, and the NADPH oxidase family (NOX1/NOX4) and apoptosis-related proteins p53 and PUMA (p53 up-regulated apoptotic regulator) were detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting. The total RNA extracted by nano-magnetic beads was retrieved into DNA by the MagBeads Total RNA Extraction Kit, and cDNA was synthesized through reverse transcription. Podocyte apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. In comparison with the control group, the high glucose group exhibited the reduced expression of podocyte cytoskeleton proteins, decreased p-AMPK activity, increased expression of NOX1, NOX4, P53, and PUMA, and increased podocyte apoptosis (28.15%±1.38%). APN intervention could significantly restore the expression of cytoskeleton proteins, increase the activity of p-AMPK, reduce the expression of NOX1, NOX4, P53, and PUMA, and reduce the apoptosis of podocytes (9.15%±1.98%). The protective effect of APN disappeared when AMPK was inhibited. APN may inhibit oxidative stress-apoptosis of podocytes under high glucose conditions through the activation of AMPK."
547,Overexpression of transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif promotes epithelial mesenchymal transformation of ovarian cancer cells by upregulating Smad3 and Snail1,2020-01-01,"This study is intended to explore the effect of transcriptional coactivator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ) expression in ovarian cancer cells as well as investigate the expression of signal proteins Smad3 and Snail1. Ovarian cancer cells (SKOV-3) were divided into two groups: control and TAZ overexpression. The overexpression of TAZ in SKOV-3 cells was determined by immunofluorescence, western blot, and qRT-PCR. The proliferation, invasiveness, and expression of epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT)-associated proteins were detected, and the expression of Smad3 and Snail1 proteins was determined by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting TAZ were synthesized and used to transfect SKOV-3. Cell migration and invasion were observed via a wound healing assay and a transwell assay, respectively. The expressions of representative genes involved in proliferation and migration, EMT-associated proteins and Smad3 and Snail1 proteins were also detected by western blot assays. The results of qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and western blot showed that, compared with the control group, the expressions of Smad3 and Snail1 protein were upregulated, and the expression of EMT-related genes-including Actin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin protein-was downregulated in the TAZ overexpression group. After TAZ mRNA was suppressed, the migration and invasion ability of the TAZ siRNA group was weaker than that of the control group. In addition, the expression level of Smad3 and Snail1 decreased when TAZ was silenced, while the expression of EMT-related genes increased. Therefore, TAZ in ovarian cancer cells can promote growth, migration, and invasiveness of cancer cells by regulating genes related to proliferation, migration, and invasion."
548,"Removal of metal ions Cd(II), Cr(VI) and Ni(II) from aqueous solution using an organic aerogel and carbon aerogel obtained by acid catalysis",2020-01-01,"In this work, we evaluated the adsorption capacity of the metal ions Cd(II), Cr(VI) and Ni(II) from aqueous solution of an organic aerogel, a carbon aerogel and a commercial activated carbon. Aerogel (Ae) was obtained by acid catalysis using HCl, achieving a quick synthesis, then, a process of carbonization to obtain the carbon aerogel (CAe) was performed. Structural, textural and chemical parameters of the porous solids obtained were characterized by different experimental techniques: scanning electron microscopy (SEM), adsorption isotherms of N2 at 77 K and CO2 at 273 K, Boehm titrations and pHPZC determination. The three adsorbents were employed in simple adsorption systems of Ni(II), Cd(II) and Cr(VI) from aqueous solution. It was determined that the synthesized aerogel is the material that performed the highest adsorption capacity of the three metal ions: Ni (32.2 mg g–1) Cd (18.6 mg g–1) and Cr (35.5 mg g–1)."
549,"""Double-W-shaped"" temperature dependence of emission linewidth in an InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well structure with intense phase separation",2020-01-01,"The temperature dependence of the spectra of photoluminescence (PL) from a blue InGaN/GaN multiplequantum-well (MQW) structure is investigated at lower excitation power. Two emission peaks, related to InGaN and assigned to In-rich quasi-quantum dots (QDs) and InGaN-matrix in the full PL spectrum, were observed. Upon increasing the temperature, both PL peak linewidths exhibited ""double-W-shaped"" (narrowing–broadening–narrowing–broadening–narrowing–broadening) temperature dependence. Combined with the observed features of the temperature dependences of the PL intensities, the temperature-dependent behaviors in this case can be interpreted as the relaxation and thermalization of carriers inside respective phase structures and the transfer of carriers between two phase structures, because of the strong phase separation and significant component fluctuation in the InGaN well layers."
550,Dose- and time-dependent effects of low molecular weight heparin on trophoblast,2020-01-01,"Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been successfully applied in the treatment of pregnancy complications associated with pro-thrombotic and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The underlying mechanism remains enigmatic. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of time and dosage of LMWH on the proliferation and apoptosis of human trophoblast. The biological function of LMWH on primary trophoblast was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), by detecting the expression of proliferation genes SDS22, APPL1, CyclinB1, as well as the expression of apoptosis-related gene Survivin. Our results showed that the treatment time and dosage of LMWH have critical effects on trophoblast proliferation and apoptosis. LMWH had the most obvious effect on promoting trophoblast proliferation and could suppress apoptosis at the concentration of 0.1 IU/ml at 72 h. This study thus provides detailed mechanism of the biological effects of LMWH on trophoblast, and sheds light on the effective clinical application of LMWH in pregnancy complications."

The goal of this work was to explore the potential application of nano-silver-containing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) composite film in grape fresh-keeping. Mechanical properties, transparency, barrier performance and antibacterial activity of Nano-silver-containing PVA film were tested and results showed that the antibacterial zone diameter of nano-silver on Aspergillus niger was 14.4 mm, with minimum bactericidal concentration of 75 ppm. The PVA antibacterial membrane effectively revealed antibacterial properties. Moreover, the decreased mechanical properties and transparency enhanced barrier performance of antibacterial membrane compared with PVA film. For comparison, the fresh-keeping effects of non-packaging film, commercial cling wrap and nano-silver-containing PVA film on sensory score, mass loss rate, decay rate, Ascorbic Acid (Vc) content and titratable acid content were also studied. Results indicated that the PVA antibacterial membrane significantly effectively avoided sensory score, water, decay, Ascorbic Acid (Vc) and titratable acid in grapes during storage, and had a remarkable effect in prolonging grapes' shelf life due to its breathability and antibacterial activity."
552,Well-aligned BaTiO nanofibers via solution blow spinning and their application in lithium composite solid-state electrolyte,2019-12-01,"In this work, an efficient and simple solution blow spinning method for preparing well-aligned nanofibers was proposed. Compared with common electrospinning, this method is more promising for scalable fabrication because of fewer process requirements. Through this method, well aligned BaTiO3 nanofibers were fabricated, and their average diameter was about 300 nm. When introducing PEO and LiTFSI ionic conductive polymer composites into the aligned BaTiO3 nanofibers membrane, a composite solid-state polymer electrolyte was obtained. The excellent structure for the electrolyte was also analyzed and its electrochemical performance was tested. Results showed that the lithium ionic conductivity at 30 °C increased from 5.74 × 10–6 S · cm–1 to 5.83 × 10–5 S · cm –1 with addition of aligned BaTiO3 nanofibers, and its thermal and electrochemical stability were all significantly improved."
553,Effect of pre-strain on the fatigue behavior of SAPH440 steel,2019-12-01,"The present research envisages the effects of different uniaxial tensile pre-strain levels on the fatigue properties of the SAPH440 steel. The S-N curves of different pre-strain levels (0%, 6%, 12%, 18%) were drawn using different load levels, with a stress ratio R = –1. The test results show that the fatigue strength of the SAPH440 steel increased with an increasement in the uniaxial tensile pre-strain levels. The static tensile test was carried out on different uniaxial tensile and different pre-strain levels specimens. The results show that with an increase in the uniaxial tensile pre-strain levels, the degree of work hardening of the SAPH440 steel and the static strength increased. Additionally, the hardening index and the elongation at break reduced, while the tensile strength and yield strength increased. TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) observation of the test samples with different pre-strain levels showed that the dislocation density of different pre-strain levels specimens increased with an increasement in the pre-strain levels. This resulted in an increasement in the fatigue strength of the SAPH440 steel, the degree of work hardening, and the static strength. However, compared with fatigue strength, the increase of dislocation density has a more significant effect on static strength."
554,Laser melting deposition of duplex stainless-steel coating on high strength low alloy pipeline steels for improving wear and corrosion resistance,2019-12-01,"In this paper, a duplex stainless steels coating was successfully prepared on high strength low alloy (HSLA) pipeline steels by laser melting deposition. The microstructure and phase identification of the obtained coating were identified by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The tribological behavior and corrosion behavior were investigated by high-speed reciprocating friction and wear tester, polarization test, E ocp–t curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Results show that the obtained coating is bonded metallurgically with the substrate and comprises α, γ, M2B and (Fe, Cr)23C6 phase. In addition, the obtained coating shows nearly 22.5% improvement in wear resistance over the substrate and much better corrosion resistance due to its nobler open circuit potential (E ocp), corrosion current density (i  corr) and bigger impedance value than the substrate, confirming that the laser melting deposited duplex stainless steels coating can be a promising candidate for the protective coating of HSLA pipeline steels."
555,Modal and harmonic response analysis of a rolling bearing coupled by rigid and flexible materials,2019-12-01,"Elastic composite cylindrical roller bearing is a new type of rolling bearings. Its rolling body is composed of rigid and flexible materials. In order to investigate the modal characteristics and harmonic response rules of the elastic composite cylindrical roller bearings with different structural parameters, we computed the modal solutions of a cylindrical roller bearing and the elastic composite cylindrical roller bearings with filling degrees of 40%, 50% and 65%, and determined the scope of the excitation frequency according to the computed first twelve orders of the modal frequency. On this basis, we analyzed the steady-state response under a sinusoidal alternating load as well as the vibration conditions of the elastic composite cylindrical roller bearings with different filling degrees within the excitation scope, and explored the relationship between the responses such as displacement and stress and the excitation frequency. The results showed that the natural frequencies of the elastic composite cylindrical roller bearings with filling degrees of 40% and 50% were similar to that of a solid bearing, while that of the elastic composite cylindrical roller bearings with a filling degree of 65% was relatively smaller than that of a solid bearing. The vibration modes of the bearings mainly manifested as bending and torsional deformation of the inner rings. Under the action of an excitation load, the peak responses of the bearings occurred near the fifth and sixth orders of the natural frequency. This research can provide a theoretical reference for the optimal design and engineering applications of the elastic composite cylindrical roller bearings."
556,Size separation of graphene oxide via multi-layer filtering by silica gel column,2019-12-01,"The properties and applications of graphene-based materials largely depend on the lateral size and size distribution of graphene and its derivatives sheets. In this work, a novel size separation method was developed for graphene oxide (GO) sheets using a multi-layer filtering of silica gel column. GO sheets were separated into three groups with narrowed size distributions after filtering from the multi-scale holes that were formed due to the packing of irregular silica gel particles. This economical and continuous-operational separation method shows promising future to realize the size separation in industrial sector. The size separation mechanism was considered that the size of GO sheets affected the flow speed, owing to the friction force between the GO sheet and silica gel particle surface. In addition, the related reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was obtained via the separated GO. The size impact of rGO sheets on the electrochemical properties were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostat charge/discharge (GC/D) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)."

Not only the synergistic combustion mechanisms of Kissinger method and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa method were revealed, but also the combustion effect and efficiency were compared. Both two methods proved specimens that processed by TE exhibited higher thermal stability. The smaller aggregates of physical initial Nano-Silica, the better dispersivity of aggregates in specimens that processed by VE. Such property broke the compactness degree of char layer."
558,Morphologies and characteristic of glass fiber suspensions basing on various beating speeds,2019-12-01,"Glass fibers commonly flocculate in suspensions and slurries, which can be largely prevented by a beating process. In this paper, morphologies and characteristics of glass fiber suspensions resulting from various beating speeds are explored. By increasing the speed (ranging from 1500 revolutions to 12000 revolutions), glass fibers can be translated, rotated, bended and broken, which leads the drainage resistances of glass fiber suspensions increase dramatically from 19.5 °SR to 23.5 °SR, then fluctuate and settle close to 22.5 °SR. Decreasing the fiber length leads to reduction in fiber–fiber contact and improves the uniformity of fiber suspensions. The separation and random distribution of glass fibers decreases in the viscosity of the fiber suspension."
559,"Effect of steel slag powder, fly ash, and silica fume on the mechanical properties and durability of cement mortar",2019-12-01,"This study is aimed at exploring the effect of steel slag powder (SSP), fly ash (FA), and silica fume (SF) on the mechanical properties and durability of cement mortar. SSP, SF, and FA were used as partial replacement of the Ordinary Portland cement (OPC). It was showed that the compressive and bending strength of steel slag powder were slightly lower than that of OPC. An increase in the SSP content caused a decrease in strength. However, the growth rate of compressive strength of SSP2 (20% replacement by the weight of OPC) at the curing ages of 90 days was about 8% higher than that of OPC, and the durability of SSP2 was better than that of OPC. The combination of mineral admixtures improved the later strength, water impermeability, and sulfate resistance compared with OPC and SSP2. The compressive strength of SSPFA (SSP and SF) at 90 days reached 70.3 MPa. The results of X-ray diffraction patterns and scanning electron microscopy indicated that SSP played a synergistic role with FA or SF to improve the performance of cement mortar."
560,Holey graphene oxide as filler to improve electrochemical performance of solid polymer electrolytes,2019-12-01,"Solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) have attracted wide attention of researchers because of their high safety performance and high mechanical strength. In this paper, holey graphene oxide (HGO) was added to poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) solid polymer electrolytes with lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonimide) (LiTFSI) as salt to improve the ionic conductivity of solid polymer electrolytes. It was shown that the addition of holey graphene oxide improved the electrochemical window and ionic conductivity. When the amount of holey graphene oxide was 0 wt%, the ionic conductivity was 2.06 × 10–4 S/cm at 60 °C. In comparison, when the amount of holey graphene oxide was 0.2 wt%, the ionic conductivity was greatly increased to 6.05 × 10–4 S/cm. This was mainly due to the fact that addition of holey graphene oxide reduced the crystallization of polymer and promoted the migration of lithium ion. Meanwhile, the electrochemical window was expanded to 5.2 V and the cycle performance for the batteries was also improved."
561,Investigation on the preparation of nanoparticles by inverse micro-emulsion polymerization for enhanced oil recovery,2019-12-01,"Polyacrylamide nanoparticles attracted increasing interest as profile control agents in oilfield development owing to the characteristics of deformation and continuous expansion in core pore. In this article, the structure and morphology of polyacrylamide nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). And the fluorescence microscopy and core displacement equipment were used to evaluate the properties of the expansion and plugging properties. Results showed that the nanoparticles prepared by inverse emulsion polymerization can be able to pass through the pores in the rocks due to the uniform particle size which is less than 500 nm. When the nanoparticles were in contact with water for 72 hours, the average particle size increased to 12.2 μm. The water-swelled nanoparticles can effectively block the high-permeability layer and improve the oil recovery in the low-permeability layer. The results obtained in this paper reveal the mechanism of elastic deformation and expansion characteristics of polyacrylamide nanoparticles, and further prove the great potential of nanoparticles to enhance oil recovery in the development of low permeability oilfields."

In this study, a Cu–Ag alloy was incorporated into a CD4MCu duplex stainless steel (DSS) to produce a good antibacterial property. The Ag-bearing CD4MCu duplex stainless steel samples were conducted solid solution treatment at various temperatures. The effects of the solid solution temperature on the microstructure, mechanical and corrosion properties, as well as silver ion release characteristics and antibacterial properties were investigated. Results show that apart from the original α, γ phases, Ag-bearing phases were formed in all samples after solid solution at different temperatures. The volume fraction of α and Ag-bearing phases decrease with increasing solution temperature. The tensile strength, hardness, elongation, and corrosion resistance first decrease and then increase along with the increase in the solid solution temperature. The heat treatment conducted at 1150 °C increases the strength, the hardness, the pitting corrosion resistance, and the antimicrobial capability simultaneously. The antibacterial rates of all the Ag-bearing CD4MCu duplex stainless steel samples after solid solution treatment are above 99%, indicating their good anti-bacterial capabilities."

The simulations helped to study the parameters of the AgD that affects the SERS and we applied these simulation results for experimental designs, in which our experimental results of synthesis and characterization results of Raman spectrum showed consistence with the simulation results. These simulation results are very helpful in deciding the experimental parameters for efficient and effective synthesizing and reproduction of hierarchical silver dendritic nanostructure. The AgD were produced using displacement redox reaction between AgNO3 solution and Copper foil. We found that the concentration of AgNO3 played major role on the rate of reaction, and the rapid growth of the silver nanostructures was observed as the reaction time increases. The structural and morphological evolution of silver dendrites was examined with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The Raman enhancement of AgDs was evaluated using Elman's reagent (DTNB) and Rhodamine 6G (R6G). The silver dendrites have great potential for diverse sensing applications ranging from food safety control, environmental monitoring and assessment, forensic investigation, and to medical diagnosis."
565,Research on deep profile control technology of polymer gel with low hydrolytic degree,2019-12-01,"Polymer gels have attracted increasing interest as profile control agent to control water content and enhance oil recovery in heterogeneous reservoirs. However, retarding the gel crosslinking reaction of polymer and making it farther in the reservoir has become a difficulty in deep profile control. In this article, polyacrylamide with low degree of hydrolysis was prepared to react slowly with chromium ion to form gel, which was used for adjusting water injection profile. The microstructure of polymer gel was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Core displacement experiments were used to evaluate the profile adjustment capability of polymer gels. It was found that the gel prepared by crosslinking the 5% polyacrylamide with chromium acetate can retard gelation time to 30 days in comparison with the conventional polymer gels when the polymer concentration reached to 1500 mg/L. The gel can form a regular spatial network which increases the viscosity from 80.2 to 6578 mPa · s. The results obtained by the core flooding experiment prove that the polymer gel has good profile control ability and further demonstrate the future potential of polymer gel to enhance oil recovery."
566,Effect of heat treatment on microstructure and corrosion resistance of extruded ZK80 Mg alloy,2019-12-01,"The corrosion characteristics and corrosion mechanism of the extruded ZK80 alloy with different states soaking in 3.5% NaCl solution at room temperature were analyzed via OM, SEM, EDS, XRD and static weightlessness method and other experimental analysis methods. The results show that when the aging temperature is constant, and the corrosion rate decreases with the lengthen of aging time, while when the corrosion time is constant, the corrosion rate increases with the increase in aging time. Appropriate aging treatment not only refines the grain of the alloy, but also precipitates the Mg–Zn phase which can effectively prevent the corrosion process and improve the anti-corrosion properties of the alloy. The main corrosion characteristics of the alloy are filamentary corrosion and pitting corrosion."
567,The evaluation of microstructure characteristic and corrosion performance of laser-re-melted Fe-based amorphous coating deposited via plasma spraying,2019-12-01,"The laser re-melting treatment was performed on the plasma-sprayed Fe-based amorphous coating to ameliorate the corrosion performance of the coating. The re-melting depth was about 200 μm which was mainly controlled by laser energy input, beam speed and facular dimension. The microstructure was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The corrosion property of the coatings was addressed via electrochemistry methods in a 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. The results indicate that the plasma-sprayed coating becomes much denser after laser re-melting treatment. The connected porosity ratio in as-sprayed coating dramatically reduces from 16.3% to 2.4% after laser re-melting. The as-sprayed coating mainly contains amorphous and much limited crystal phase, and some amorphous phase in the as-sprayed coating crystalizes during laser re-melting. Polarization test demonstrated that the as-sprayed coating has a significantly dramatical effect for improving corrosion performance of carbon steel, while the laser re-melting process is a more efficient method. The influence level of the coating compactness in this study is roughly two times as big as that of amorphous in coating, in the term of improving corrosion resistance of carbon steel."
568,CIAPIN1 is a potential target for apoptosis of multiple myeloma,2019-12-01,"This study firstly aimed to reveal the gene expression differences of CIAPIN1 between myelomas cells from bone marrow cells of multiple myeloma patients and normal human, and subsequently investigate the regulation role of this gene on tumorigenicity ability of multiple myeloma (MM) cell line U266 via in vitro colony formation and in vivo xenograft studies. RT-PCR results obtained from 18 MM patients and 10 health people showed that the expression of CIAPIN1 gene was 4 times higher in normal human compared to MM patients. Besides, CIAPIN1 siRNA (si-CIAPIN1) transfected U266 cells presented higher proliferation ratio and superior colony forming ability than U266 cells and U266 cells transfected with non-coding siRNA (controls) evaluated by CCK8 test and soft agar colony formation assay, respectively. In a mice MM xenograft model, the si-CIAPIN1 transfected U266 cells induced the biggest tumor compared to the controls. Furthermore, CIAPIN1 overexpressed U266 cells were developed and compared with the si-CIAPIN1 transfected U266 cells to study the role of CIAPIN1 in the production of apoptosis related proteins in U266 cells. Results indicated that CIAPIN1 facilitated apoptosis promoting proteins expression in U266 cells, such as upregulation of BAX, BAK, Bcl-xs and BIM, and downregulation of p38, PKC, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl proteins. Therefore, CIAPIN1 can be a potential suppression target gene in multiple myeloma."
569,Characterization of a new esterase for enantioselective resolution of ()-methyl mandelate,2019-12-01,"A new esterase gene (EST35) was cloned from Dactylosporangium sp. BB08 and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Optimum catalytic activity of EST35 was at 30 C and it could be activated at 0 °C. EST35 remained high activity in 20% (V/V) cyclohexane, hexane, heptane, methanol and DMSO. Interestingly the enzyme exhibits good enantioselectivity towards (R, S)-methyl mandelate leaving with an optical purity of 97% (R)-methyl mandelate and make EST35 a promising enzyme for biotechnology application."
570,Very high cycle fatigue behavior of dissimilar martensitic stainless-steel diffusion-bonded joints,2019-12-01,"Very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) behavior of the diffusion bonded joints between 3Cr13 and 2Cr13 were investigated. Results showed that the diffusion bonded joints obtained a comparable fatigue property of 2Cr13, and the S–N curves exhibited a decreasing shape characteristic. However, fatigue life was dramatically decreased by occasional non-diffusion defects. Fatigue cracks in diffusion bonded joints occurred at specimen's surface in high cycle regimes, whereas VHCF cracks were originated from inclusions on the side of 2Cr13 based materials, in which the fine granular area (FGA) characteristics were observed around the internal inclusion. Furthermore, fatigue strength of the diffusion joints was interpreted based on the Murakami model. The crack propagation life estimated by Paris-Hertzberg-McClintock model mainly contributed for the fatigue life of the specimens with occasional non-fusion defects, in which non-fusion defects acted as pre-cracks."
571,Microstructure evolution of a Ti–Al–Sn–Zr based alloy during the hot compression deformation,2019-12-01,"The Ti–Al–Sn–Zr based alloy was fabricated and its deformation behavior was investigated with increasing of temperature and strain rate. Microstructure and phase of the as-fabricated, heat treated and deformed alloy was characterized by OM, XRD and TEM. The results exhibited that the addition of Mo, Nb and Ta promoted the precipitate of β phase at relative low heat treatment temperature. And the β phase has relative good phase interface with the αphase. During the compression test, the compressive strength of the alloy dropped with the strain rate decreasing and the testing temperature rising. When the compression deformation was preformed above α phase transformation temperature, the high strain rate would promote the phase transformation. When the alloy was compressed with strain rate of 1 s–1, it almost had the similar compressive strengths at 960 °C and 940 °C. Moreover, the same phenomenon appeared when the compression was carried out at 960 °C and 980 °C with stain rate of 0.01 s–1. Such a phenomenon should be ascribed to the existence of high amount of β phase which could contribute to the strength."

574,Analysis of digital light synthesis based flexible and rigid polyurethane for applications in automobile bumpers,2019-11-01,"The current work presents the design of automobile bumper using two novel materials, Flexible Polyurethane and Rigid Polyurethane, which meets the desired functional requirements for better performance. Two different designs for automobile bumpers have been made and corresponding deformation and stresses are investigated using Finite Element Analysis. The impact tests were carried out for two different materials of automobile bumpers. Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy were done to characterize and compare the bumper materials with Rigid Polyurethane fabricated by Digital Light Synthesis. Both Flexible Polyurethane and Rigid Polyurethane outperform the existing bumper materials in terms of the impact strength. Among the new materials investigated, Rigid Polyurethane displays less deflection and Von-mises stresses and hence it may be suitable to replace the existing bumper materials in heavy vehicles with Rigid Polyurethane. The impact strength of Flexible Polyurethane is more than Rigid Polyurethane and hence this material may replace the existing materials in passenger cars."
575,Evaluating weld properties of conventional and swept friction stir spot welded 6061-T6 aluminium alloy,2019-11-01,"6061-T6 aluminium alloy is a tempered grade aluminium material that is extensively used, particularly in space and automotive applications. The conventional and swept friction stir spot welding (FSSW) joints are prepared by varying tool rotational speed at four different levels. The mechanical properties, microstructure and mode of failure in both types of FSSW are evaluated and reported. The high plastic deformation and fine grains influenced the increase in hardness of the weld joints based on the Hall-Petch equation. The highest lap shear strength of 5.31 kN is observed in swept FSSW sample prepared at 1400 rpm. Interestingly, 1600 rpm decreased the lap shear strength due to insufficient friction between base metal and tool in the higher tool rotational speed. The minimum microhardness is noticed in heat-affected zone (HAZ) of both cases. Conventional FSSW samples showed shear fracture, nugget pullout fracture and circumferential fracture under lap shear loading, whereas swept FSSW showed only the circumferential fracture."
576,Experimental and numerical investigation on the effective thermal conductivity of stochastic structure,2019-11-01,"The Conception of thermo-physical properties of porous materials is a challenging task for scientists to conquer. The open cell metal foam increases heat transfer while energy dissipation, dimension and density of them which are constraints for modern technologies significantly reduce. In the present study, the open cell metal foams with four kinds of structures have been investigated numerically and experimentally and the effective thermal conductivity (ETC) of them have been extracted with using different base fluids such as water, air and paraffin. Also, various metals have been considered copper, aluminum, nickel and silver. Finally, a validated correlation for calculation of ETC of open cell metal foams has been developed which is function of thermal conductivity of fluid and metal, porosity and geometrical properties of pore that is applicable for all open cell metal foam approximately. The results show, good agreements between the modeling results and experimental data."
577,Electromagnetic interference shielding and mechanical properties of multi-layered polyvinyl chloride/multiwall carbon nanotubes nanocomposite,2019-11-01,"Electromagnetic shielding is one of the promising research areas that attract the interest of many researchers, especially researchers interested in polymer nanocomposite. In this work, the shielding efficiency and dynamic mechanical analysis for multi-layered samples are reviewed and analyzed. The multi-layered samples were prepared using two sheets of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) polymer loaded with multiwall carbon nanotubes over the electrical percolation threshold, and a MWCNTs buckypaper (MWCNTs BP) sheet between them. The three sheets were collected together by hot-press technique to form a multi-layered nanocomposite sample. The shielding efficiency of single and double layers of PVC/MWCNTs sheets loaded by 5 wt.% MWCNTs, was very weak. The new structured (3 layered/multilayered) nanocomposite samples were prepared with different weight percent of MWCNTs BP sheet (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 wt.%). The SE values over all the frequency range (450 MHz to about 2.0 GHz) are strongly depends on the weight percent of the MWCNTs BP. Shielding efficiency increased as the MWCNTs BP weight percent increased. Decreases the elastic modulus, storage modulus and the coefficient of complex viscosity were found for a new set of samples contains 0.14, 0.27, 0.28 and 0.44 wt.% MWCNTs BP layers. This is due to the diffused MWCNTs from the mesh to polymer layers making the composite more brittle. The glass transition temperature determined from tanδ(f) increased as MWCNTs BP content increases."
578,"Synthesis, characterization and anti-cancer applications of ytterbium doped gadolinium molybdate nanophosphor compound",2019-11-01,"Nanophosphor compounds with both diagnostic and therapeutic functions are potential for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Lanthanide complexes play a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and therapy. Gadolinium-complexes are commonly used as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents for cancer imaging. The role of a lanthanide, Ytterbium (Yb) in cancer treatment is not unknown. The present work focuses on finding the role of Yb when doped into Gadolinium complexes in cancer treatment. Our results demonstrate that Yb doped Gadolinium molybdate coated with biocompatible silica, effectively inhibited the viability of breast cancer cells after 24 and 48 h of treatment in in vitro, and in contrast the nanophosphor compounds did not affect the viability of healthy cells. Yb doped Gadolinium molybdate also up-regulated apoptotic genes in breast cancer cells. Hence we propose that Yb doped Gadolinium molybdate is a promising theranostic compound. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing anti-cancer nature of Ytterbium-doped into Gadolinium nanophosphors."
579,Enhanced rate performance and high current cycle stability of LiNiCoMnO by sodium doping,2019-11-01,"Sodium ions have been successfully doped into LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) by solid phase method. The influences of Na doping on the electrochemical properties of the electrode at high current intensities were studied. The experimental results show that 3% Na modified LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 has superior rate performance and cycling behavior due to the cation mixing is suppressed and the structural stability is enhanced by Na doping. The capacity retention of Li0.97Na0.03Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 is 64.33% after 100th cycles at 10 C (1 C = 200 mA · g–1) in the potential range from 2.8 V to 4.3 V, which is greatly higher than the pristine NCM (only 35.01%). Li0.97Na0.03Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 also shows excellent rate performance of 140.5 mAh · g–1 at 10 C, and the discharge capacity of 3% Na-NCM is higher than that of the pristine NCM when the current intensity is returned from 10 C to 0.5 C. The analysis of the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements confirm that the Na doping plays an important role in inhibiting the electrochemical polarization of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 and improving the diffusion of lithium ions."
580,The anchored location of CdS on SiC via organosilane for effective heterogeneous interface design in photocatalysis,2019-11-01,"This work demonstrates a new approach to construct a heterogeneous junction by means of the periodic lattice distribution of semiconductor atoms. The organosilane was applied as an anchored coupling agent to connect the semiconductors at both ends, one of which connects SiC and the other connects CdS, and the SiC/M/CdS heterogeneous junction was established. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution ability of this heterojunction was three times as much as the traditional SiC/CdS composite under visible light. Meanwhile, the uniform interface distribution, prolonged charge-carrier lifetime and minor electron–hole recombination were achieved. The results provide new insights into interface design and offer an indepth understanding with respect to organic–inorganic heterojunction configuration in photocatalysis."
581,Growth of corrosion product film on 12Cr1MoV steel in sulfur-containing sodium aluminate solution,2019-11-01,"The growth mechanism of product film on steel surface in sulfur-containing sodium aluminate solution was studied with relevance to processing of high-sulfur bauxite ores in Bayer process. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), potentiodynamic polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to study the growth of corrosion product film on 12Cr1MoV steel in sodium aluminate solution containing 5 g/L S2– and 3 g/L S2O2– 3. Results indicated that the corrosion rate gradually decreased with increasing corrosion time (t). The fitted corrosion rate equation was V = 4.365t –0.809. The corrosion resistance was highest after 5 d. The growth evolution of the product film was divided into three stages: film formation, film conversion and film growth. The final corrosion product film comprised an inner film layer mainly composed of Fe3O4 and an outer film layer mainly composed of FeS, FeS2 and Fe2O3."
582,Flexural experimental study on reinforced concrete beams strengthened with carbon fiber-reinforced polymer laminates using anchorage systems,2019-11-01,"Flexural capacity of RC beams gets significant improvement with externally bonded Carbon Fiber-reinforced Polymer (CFRP) sheet. The anchorage system is a valid means to restrain or delay debonding failure caused by stress concentration at the ends of CFRP sheets. In this paper, four RC beams, measuring 150 × 200 × 1900 mm, were examined under four-point bending test. One beam was applied for contrast. And other three were CFRP strengthened with no anchorage, CF anchors (carbon fiber anchors) and U-wraps (U-shaped CFRP wraps). The primary purpose of the experiment was to validate the effectiveness of CF anchors and U-wraps in improving the flexure character of beams strengthened with CFRP sheets. The experimental results revealed that the strengthened beams using anchorage systems performed remarkably in beam ductility, flexural capacity, load-deflection response and failure mode compared with the contrast beam. The anchorage systems were more effective and necessary to enhance the flexural behavior of beams as using CFRP laminates for flexural strengthening."
583,Investigation of heat treatment and subsequently surface modification by nano-TiO on Mg–Zn–Ca–Mn bio-magnesium alloy,2019-11-01,"The microstructure and mechanical properties of Mg–2Zn–0.5Ca–1.0Mn alloy under different treatments were investigated. Nano-TiO2 with biological activity was added to the self-optimized silicate electrolyte in order to enhance the corrosion resistance and the activity of micro-arc oxidation (MAO) coatings formed in the aged bio-magnesium alloy silicate electrolyte. Results show that the tensile strength and micro-hardness of solution treatment alloy were 194 MPa and 40.55 HV, respectively, which were increased by 11% and 30% comparing with as-cast alloy. Subsequently, the experimental alloy was aged at 175 °C from 0.5 h to 36 h, the tensile strength of the alloy reached 229 MPa when the alloy was aged to 16 h, which was 55 MPa higher than the as-cast alloy. Besides, the fracture mechanism transformed from the cleavage fracture to quasi-cleavage fracture after heat treatment. Different content of modified nano-TiO2 (1, 3 and 5 g/L) is added into based silicate electrolyte has been utilized to modify the bio-magnesium coatings for precoated metals. The sealing processes on MAO coatings surface effectively improve the corrosion resistance property of the bio-magnesium alloy. As the concentration of nano-TiO2 increases from 0 g/L to 5 g/L, the corrosion potential of MAO ceramic film increases gradually. When the concentration of nano-TiO2 is 5 g/L, the corrosion potential of the formed ceramic film is the highest, reaching – 1.3601 V, this shows that the ceramic membrane has good corrosion resistance."
584,Glucagon-like peptide-1 analog protects proximal tubules injury from lysosomal dysfunction and impaired autophagic flux,2019-11-01,"The role of glucagon-like peptide-1 analog (GLP-1) in autophagic flux and lysosomal dysfunction in obesityrelated glomerulopathy (ORG) remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that exposure to a high-fat diet (HFD) resulted in ectopic lipid accumulation, increased 24-hour urinary albumin, and vacuolated tubular cells. The apoptotic cell content in renal tubules was remarkably increased in the HFD group, compared to CON mice, as evident from TUNEL staining and caspase-3 expression, and significantly decreased upon switching to the normal chow diet and GLP-1 treatment. Compared to the control group, significant accumulation of Oil red O staining and CD36 and PLIN2 was observed in tubular cells of HFD mice. In the HFDG and HFD-C groups, lipid droplet deposition in tubular cells were inhibited. LC3 and p62 levels were markedly increased in proximal tubules of HFD mice, and palmitic acid impaired autophagic flux in HK2 cells. Electron microscopy revealed that non-functional lysosomal residue merged with the functional lysosome in the HFD group. GLP-1 treatment and a normal chow diet led to inhibition of enlarged lysosomal residue and restored autophagic flux. In conclusion, impaired lysosome and autophagic flux may be ameliorated by GLP-1 treatment and replacement with a normal chow diet."
585,DNA Methyltransferase 1 Affects Proliferation and Migration of Colorectal Cancer Cells by Regulating Ras Association Domain Family 1 Methylation,2019-11-01,"The effects of DNMT1 on human colorectal cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis as well as the possible underlying mechanisms were investigated. SW480 cells were treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-AZA-CdR. qRT-PCR was used to analyze mRNA expression, whereas protein expression was evaluated by western blotting. Cell growth, migration, and invasion were measured by MTT, transwell migration, and wound healing assays, respectively. Cell morphology was observed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. 5-AZA-CdR treatment inhibited DNMT1 expression in colorectal cancer cells. Further, low expression of DNMT1 regulated RASSF1A-mediated inhibition of CyclinD1 expression, as well as colon cancer cell morphology, proliferation, and migration via RASSF1A methylation. Our results provide a basis for therapeutic strategies based on DNMT1 and RASSF1A for colorectal cancer."
586,Based on magnetic beads to develop the kit for extraction of high-quality cell-free DNA from blood of breast cancer patients,2019-11-01,"Early detection of breast cancer (BC) is very important to avoid mortality caused by it. It is concluded in recent studies that the DNA in patient's serum can be used as biomarker for cancer detection. Therefore, extracting high-quality DNA from patient's serum can achieve this goal. In this work, we compared three methods (phenol-chloroform, column-based and magnetic beads) of extracting DNA from serum by means of purchased commercial kits and concluded that column-based kit is the best one to extract Cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Then we developed a new kit named PuriMag magnetic beads kit to extract DNA from serum of BC patients. Further, we described the properties of this new kit including its recovery capacity and stability. We compared the extraction performances of PuriMag magnetic beads kit and column-based kit and concluded that PuriMag magnetic beads are a better method to extract cfDNA. Surely PuriMag magnetic beads also suit automation and will be a useful method for fast, high-quality and automatic DNA extraction from serum."

Collagen stimulants are the most recent next-generation dermal fillers capable of inducing neocollagenesis. To investigate biophysical characteristics, the safety and efficacy of the newly developed combination, poly(L-lactide) or polyl-lactic acid (PLLA) and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), were compared with those of poly-para-dioxanone (PPDO), poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA), and polycaprolactone (PCL) fillers. PPDO, PLLA, PCL, or PLGA/PLLA was injected into the dorsal skin of 8-week-old rats. Tissue samples were obtained 0, 2, and 4 weeks post treatment for Sirius Red-staining, polarized light microscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blotting. The MagBeads Total RNA Extraction Kit was used to isolate total cell RNA. The PLGA/PLLA filler demonstrated similar neocollagenesis and inflammatory response as other collagen stimulants, and showed better biodegradability than PPDO, PLLA and PCL fillers. Our data suggest that the newly developed collagen-stimulating PLGA/PLLA filler may be a safe and effective option for correcting volume loss and rejuvenating photoaging skin."
588,"Immobilization of polyoxometalate on aminosilane-modified silicate: Synthesis, characterization and antibacterial performance",2019-11-01,"This paper presents studies on the immobilization of the polyoxometalate (H5PV2Mo10O40) on aminosilanemodified silicate as a new barrier of biological toxicant. The polyoxometalate-doped aminosilane-modified silicate (Ormosil/POM hybrid and Ormosil + POM blend) were synthesized by an in situ sol–gel route under acidic conditions. The physical properties of the samples were examined using NMR, SEM, XPS and TGA spectroscopy. The results indicated that POM was immobilized in channels by covalent linkages with the Ormosil of the Ormosil/POM hybrid, and that POM was incorporated into the Ormosil after impregnation from the Ormosil + POM blend. The covalent bond resulted from the reaction of Ormosil with POM, in which Si species were inserted into the vacancy of lacunary POM to form Si–O–Mo bonds. The antibacterial effects of samples were investigated with zone of inhibition testing, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The Ormosil/POM hybrid and Ormosil + POM blend possessed excellent antibacterial abilities and the antibacterial performance of the Ormosil/POM hybrid was better than that of the Ormosil + POM blend."
589,Effects of different monomer systems on shear bond strength of bonding cement to zirconia,2019-11-01,"Plenty of surface treatments to zirconia (ZrO2) are available. However, the long-term hydrolytic stability is still a major concern for the investigators. This paper explores the effects of different monomer systems on mold enclosed shear bond strength (ME-SBS) of bonding cement to zirconia (ZrO2) using commercially available silane primers with different monomer systems. Eighteen ZrO2 blanks (KaVo™ Everest) were subjected to tribo-chemical silica coating and divided into the following primer groups: (1) Sil (control); (2) Composite; (3) G-Multi; and (4) Monobond Plus. Each group was then subdivided into three subgroups (n = 6) depending on storage conditions: (1) 24-h dry storage, (2) 2-month water aging, and (3) 4-month water aging. Elemental analyses and contact angle measurements were conducted. The ME-SBSs and failure modes were analyzed. The data were subjected to the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post hoc test for pairwise comparisons (p < 0.05). Similar chemical compositions with marginal differences in content weight (%) were observed. The water contact angle measurements on treated ZrO2 were <32° in all groups. After 4-month water aging, the highest ME-SBS was exhibited by Group 4 (18.3 ± 6.5 MPa). The Monobond Plus primer systems have the ability to resist hydrolysis at the bonding cement/ZrO2 interface."
590,Current progress in electrode/pentacene interfaces of pentacene-based organic thin films transistors: A review,2019-10-01,"Organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) in device physics is currently considered as a standout amongst the most progressive concepts of device applications. Currently, due to humongous technological progress, OTFT with high mobilities can be produced that are comparable to silicon technology. This remarkable mobility is considered as a benchmark for more demanding applications which is accomplished by novel, tenable organic semiconductor materials such as pentacene and the tailoring of their geometries and characteristics. In addition, pentacene demonstrates charge carrier mobilities up to 5.5 cm2/Vs. However very low mobility was achieved in OTFTs due to fabrication defects, material processing etc. The most important defect that arise during the fabrication process is contact interfaces in OTFTs, which highly effect the device performance. Thus, in this article, we will review the current progress of contact engineering of OTFTs with special emphasis on electrode/pentacene interfaces of pentacene-based organic thin film transistors. Further, this review aims to provide an in-depth understanding of bottlenecks to improve the OTFTs performance. After a short introduction, the historical background of pentacene-based OTFTs is discussed that focuses on different methods and materials employed so far to improve the contact between pentacene layer. Also, the review presents the key challenges in the geometry of pentacene based OTFT that is the direct deposition of metal electrodes onto the pentacene channel layer in top contact interface due to which poor carrier injection, high barrier height, chemical diffusion between both layers, high contact resistance and surface roughness has been observed which highly affects the device performance especially the field effect mobility. Also, the state-of-the-art devices and related models that widely employ pentacene are presented. This detailed review will assist the future researchers in understanding and improving field-effect properties of OTFTs."

An absorption peak can be revealed at resonant wavelength 1.54 m at room temperature. The metal parameter condition is optimized in simulation in order to improve the property of this absorber. Simulated results reveal that absorption performances can be modulated based on the refractive index changes. High FOM values are obtained based on water or glucose solution. Moreover, the resonance wavelength and amplitude are modulated based on the ambient temperature changes. Finally, the effect of central metal particle side width or dielectric layer thickness at room temperature on absorption performances are also revealed in simulation."
592,Preparation and properties of bamboo/polymer composites enhanced by  polymerization of furfuryl alcohol,2019-10-01,"The objective of this paper aimed to develop a novel method to prepare enhanced bamboo-based materials. Furfuryl alcohol (FA) was used as the modification agent with maleic anhydride (MA) as the catalyst. Different bamboo samples were prepared with different FA addition level (10 wt%, 20 wt% and 30 wt%). The furfurylated bamboo samples were characterized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Moreover, the physical and mechanical properties including weight percent gain (WPG), water uptake (WU), thickness swelling (TS), modulus of rupture (MOR), and modulus of elastic (MOE) were investigated in detail. Additionally, the decay resistance of pristine and furfurylated bamboo samples was also investigated. The results showed that FA resins were incorporated into bamboo and polymerized within cell walls. The WPG, WU, and TS were dependent on FA addition level. When the FA addition level reached 30 wt%, the physical properties were all improved significantly. However, due to acidic MA as the catalyst, MOR of furfurylated bamboo samples was enhanced only 2.5% while MOE was weakened. The thermal stability and decay resistance of furfurylated bamboo were all enhanced significantly compared to pristine bamboo. Especially, furfurylated bamboo treated with 30 wt% FA achieved Class I Strong Decay Resistance (<10%) with 5.3% of mass loss."
593,Effect of Al alloy back panel on the dynamic penetration and damage characteristics of ceramic composite armors,2019-10-01,"This paper mainly focuses on the investigation of dynamic penetration and damage characteristics of a hybrid ceramic composite armor normally impacted by 12.7 mm armor piercing incendiary projectiles. The hybrid ceramic composite armor was composed of a ceramic cylinder layer, a Ti–6Al–4V plate, an ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) composite layer, and an Al alloy panel. Three different areal densities of composite laminates with 82, 87, and 92 kg/m2 were tested. 3D finite element model of the ceramic composite armor was generated in ABAQUS, and the simulation results were employed to study the damage evolution.

594,Damage characteristics of polymer expansive jet based on the crater growth enhanced effect,2019-10-01,"In this study, a polymer liner is applied to a shaped charge warhead, and the formed expansive jet exhibits a crater growth enhancement effect that can effectively damage the armored vehicle target. To examine the damage characteristics of polymer expansive jet, three polymer materials with different properties were selected, namely polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), nylon (PA), and polycarbonate (PC). The penetration results of light aluminum target and heavy steel target are analyzed via the SPH method and AUTODYN finite element software and verified via experiments. The results indicate that for light aluminum targets, the enlarged hole diameter of polymer expansive jet exceeds that of metal jets, and the penetration depth is lower than that of a metal jet. The results also suggest that the crater growth enhanced effect is more evident when the stand-off is small. With respect to high strength steel targets, the penetration ability of polymer expansive jet is limited. However, for low strength aluminum targets, the crater growth enhancement of the polymer expansive jet is reflected."
595,An ultrasensitive photoelectrochemistry sensor for ascorbic acid based on etching perylenediimide modified CoOOH nanosheets,2019-10-01,"In this work, a neoteric photoelectrochemistry (PEC) sensor on account of perylenediimide (PDI) by coupling with ascorbic acid (AA) responsive decomposition of cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) nanosheets was developed. PDI is a kind of organic photoelectric material with strong photoelectrochemical properties in aqueous solution. When the surface of the PDI is modified by CoOOH, the photoelectric properties of the PDI could be effectively decreased. However, when AA is present, CoOOH is reduced to Co2+ while the photoelectric properties of PDI are restored. The photoelectric sensor constructed thereby exhibits high selectivity and transient response, and is simple in operation, low in cost and short in time, and provides a novel detection method for small molecule ascorbic acid. In the case of a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, the detection limit is 33.4 nM. This paper opens a new PEC method to detection of AA."
596,Performance of stone-plastic composites with different mix ratios during orthogonal cutting,2019-10-01,"The present study aimed to increase understanding of the machinability of stone-plastic materials with different mix ratios subjected to diamond planing. To that end, orthogonal cutting was carried out. Different stone-plastic materials were machined by diamond cutting tools to produce chips. Based on the results, four conclusions are drawn: (1) Among stone-plastic materials with decreasing polyvinyl chloride content ratio, the maximum cutting forces and fluctuation of dynamic forces show decreasing trends, and cutting stability increases. (2) The temperature of chips is slightly higher than that of tool edges; the cutting heat generated during machining is mainly absorbed by the chips of removed material and, to a lesser extent, stored in the tool edge. The type of stone-plastic material has a great effect on the changes in the temperatures of chip and tool edge. (3) With a decrease in polyvinyl chloride content, the chip shapes evolve from crack, to arc, and eventually to elemental chips. (4) The cutting quality of the machined surface improves with a decrease in the polyvinyl chloride content ratio of the stone-plastic materials."
597,One-pot synthesis of camptothecin-loaded glutathione-responsive PEGlyation nanogels as novel antitumor therapeutics,2019-10-01,"PEGlyation nanogels have shown potential in cancer therapy due to their outstanding biodegradability and biocompatibility. In this study, glutathione (GSH)-responsive PEGlyation nanogels were loaded with camptothecin (CPT) ([email protected]2B5-PEG) by one-pot synthesis based on the monomers of disulfide-based diacrylate (A2) and N-(2-aminoethyl) ethane-1,2-diamine (B5). The nanogels with responsive cross-linked networks were degraded into small molecules according to their GSH-sensitivity. The nanogels were of the correct size as measured by TEM and DLS, and uptake into A549 cells was observed within 6 h.

The GSH-responsive CPT-loaded PEGlyation nanogels produced by one-pot synthesis are therefore promising platforms for anticancer drug delivery."
598,Effects of chemical composition and heat treatment on wear properties of backup rolls steel,2019-10-01,"In this study, friction and wear properties of backup roll steels with different chemical compositions subjected to various heat treatment processes were investigated by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and microindentation to figure out changes in microstructure during wear testing. The results showed that wear of backup roll was mainly consisted of sliding wear with some contribution from abrasive wear. The surface of backup roll material depicted obvious ploughing characteristics and plastic deformation zones after wear processing. The wear scar width, wear volume, hardened layer thickness and plastically deformed layer thickness of the backup roll material all decreased as substrate hardness increased. The wear resistance of the material enhanced with the matrix hardness. On the other hand, increasing contents of Mo, V, Nd and other elements influenced dispersion and fine grain strengthening. By comparison, increasing contents of C, Si and Mn affected the solid solution strengthening. Both methods improved wear resistance of the backup roll. The working layer of the backup roll produced by the integral induction hardening process was identified as mainly tempered martensite. In sum, the wear resistance of induction hardened backup roll significantly improved when compared to conventional differential temperature quenching."

Finally, the polarizability analysis indicates that the nuclei and electronic clouds of clusters are affected by external field with the increase of cluster size."
601,Improving hydrogen evolution performance of Co:FeS/CoS nano-heterostructure at elevated temperatures,2019-10-01,"Fabrication and improvement of high-efficient, durable, and earth-abundant non-precious metal hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts are particularly important in the production of clean energy hydrogen. In this study, we synthesized Co:FeS2/CoS2 nano-heterostructure with superior hydrogen evolution performance by a typical one-step hydrothermal method. When the temperature of HER solution was raised from 0 °C to 60 °C, the overpotential for Co:FeS2/CoS2 nano-heterostructure at 10 cm–2 was reduced from 115 to 75 mV and its Tafel slope did not change significantly. Moreover, the overpotential for Co:FeS2/CoS2 nano-heterostructure increased by only 6 mV after 1000 cycles of CV at 60 °C. This work provides a strategy for preparing and improving the performance of non-precious metal electrocatalysts to replace precious metal electrocatalysts."
602,Environment friendly qualitatively responsive ethyl cellulose films as smart food packaging,2019-10-01,"The present study assessed the applicability of pH indicators in the polymeric films that can be used as smart packaging in the food industries. The pH responsive films using Ethyl cellulose (EC) and azo indicators [i.e., Methyl Orange (MO) and Methyl Red (MR)] have been developed, which have shown remarkable sensitivity towards the pH variation. After activation in different pH range, the colour variation was measured for each film with the CIE Lab methodology. A significant L * [the parameter L * represents the lightness of colours from 0 (dark) to 100 (light), in CIELAB units] variation of EC-MO was seen ranging from 59 (at 0% acid) to 32 (at 60% acid) while for EC-MR, the variation in L * parameter was seen ranging from 89 (at 0% acid) to 32 (at 50% acid). These qualitatively responsive films were further tested for their water absorption capacity and mechanical properties. The water absorption capacity of the EC film incorporated with indicators were observed to be low as compared to the EC-standard film. The incorporation of MO resulted in a regular increase in water absorption capacity range from 34.08–47.11 while the MR incorporated films showed an irregular increase from 41.13–42.13, during a 24 hrs interval. The film with MO also showed a good mechanical property when tested by a micro UTM. The peak load was observed at around 2.7 N. Necking was more observant in the EC film incorporated with MO as compared to other samples, thus showing good plasticity."

High volume fractions of large size CNT were embedded in Al matrix composites to reduce the weight of Al by 23%. The lightweight CNT-Al composite exhibited enhanced mechanical properties, including 105.8, 246.9 and 243.7% improvement for tensile strength, fracture toughness, and elastic modulus, respectively. The decomposition of total stress into its CNT and Al matrix components indicated enhanced elastic properties were due to the shear interaction between CNT and Al in addition to the great load bearing capacity of CNT. By performing dislocation density analysis, it was discovered that the large dislocation storage capability of nanoporous CNT-Al enhanced ductility when compared to pure Al. This study demonstrates the high potential of nanoporous CNT-Al as a lightweight and strong, yet tough material, and it also provides atomic scale understanding of the mechanical behavior of CNT-Al nanocomposite."
604,Preparation and evaluation of multifunctional FeO/ZnS magnetic fluorescent nanocomposites,2019-10-01,"A new strategy is proposed for construction of multifunctional nanocomposites which possess unique optics, electricity, and magnetism. The mercaptoethylamine (MEA) was capped on the surface of Mn2+ doped ZnS quantum dots (ZnS:Mn2+ [email protected]), and carboxyl group functionalized Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4@COOH) were synthesized through a solvo-thermal method in one step. The Fe3O4@COOH was conjugated with ZnS:Mn2+ [email protected] to synthesis magnetic and fluorescent Fe3O4/ZnS nanocomposites (Fe3O4/ZnS NCs) through a facile 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) processes.

605,Investigation on nanographene generation and its molecule adsorption,2019-10-01,"An experimental method was applied to prepare nanographene, in which its surface feature was analyzed using scanning electron microscope and Fourier infrared ray analyzer. A methylene blue (MB) solution was adopted to measure the molecule adsorption of nanographene and graphite and demonstrated that nanographene had more molecule adsorption than that by graphite. As the concentration of MB solution increased, the molecule adsorption of nanographene ascended. As the stirring time of a magnetic stirrer decreased, the molecule adsorption of nanographene in the MB solution increased significantly. Meanwhile, the increment in the absorption amount of graphite reduced. As the dosage of nanographene and graphite increased, the absorption capacity of nanographene reached a peak value of 40 mg, which was two- or threefold higher than that of graphite. Hence, nanographene has higher molecule adsorption capacity than graphite."
606,A top–down approach for the preparation of bulk layered metal/organic hybrid material,2019-10-01,"Although the potential of layered metal/organic hybrid material has long been recognized, manufacturing analogous materials in large-scale remains extremely difficult owing to the lack of a suitable fabrication process. Here, a top–down approach that combines accumulative roll bonding technique with selective etching and vacuum impregnation process was first developed to fabricate bulk layered Ta/polymer hybrid material with controlled layer thickness (h) of 100 μm ≥ h ≥ 1 μm.

607,Rheological properties of micro-nano magneto-rheological fluid,2019-10-01,"In this paper, a novel micro-nano Magneto-rheological Fluid (MR) is proposed, and its mechanical performance, mainly including the shear torque and normal stress, is studied. Here, the magnetic particle in this kind of smart fluid is composed by the micro and nano particle, that is, produced by adding some nano magnetic or nonmagnetic particles into the traditional MR fluid (its particle size about 1–10 μm). A set of testing system, mainly including the plate-on-plate shearing test rig, is built to investigate the effect of the added percent of particles on the mechanical performances of MR fluid. In the condition of a constant shear rate, if the mass fraction of the nano particles is a constant, for example 4%, with the increasing of the magnetic induction intensity, the shear torque will also increase. The normal force increases rapidly with the increasing of mass fraction of the nano particles and decrease gradually."
608,Preparation and studies of docetaxel proliposome,2019-10-01,"The taxanes, paclitaxel and docetaxel, are anticancer agents used in clinical trials against ovarian carcinoma, breast, lung and head/neck cancer. Docetaxel, more soluble than paclitaxel in water, is formulated using Tween 80 and ethanol. Tween 80, albeit less toxic than Cremophor EL, may be responsible of some toxic effects. To eliminate these vehicles and improve the drug's antitumor efficacy, taxanes have been incorporated in liposomes, however the stability of the common liposomes was poor. We have prepared a well-characterized novel lyophilized liposome-based docetaxel formulation that is sterile and easy-to-use. Of the several formulations examined, docetaxel-liposomes composed of ePC/CHOL 15:3 and co-surfactant poloxamer188/ePC/3:5 were chosen for further studies. This composition was found to give more stable liposomes than other formulations. It gave 95% entrapment efficiency and particle size of 200 nm after lyophilization. The pharmacokinetic parameters intravenously administration to the rats were determined and compared with those of commercial docetaxel formulations. Encapsulation of docetaxel in proliposomes produced marked differences over the commercial preparations with an increased Cmax, prolonged elimination half-life, and an increased value for Area Under Curve (AUC). The obtained values for mean residence time (MRT) indicated that docetaxel remains longer for liposomal formulation. The docetaxel proliposome (PRDL) was more effective than docetaxel injection (DXL-INJ) and plain docetaxel liposome (PDL) in the high, medium and low docetaxel dose trials."
609,Study of dry sliding friction and wear behavior of bionic surface of hardened steel,2019-09-01,"Considering typical bionic wear-resistant non-smooth surfaces, including prototypes such as the surface pits of a dung beetle body and desert viper abdomen, hardened steel mold wear samples for simulating the morphologies of the rectangular pits on a dung beetle body surface and the regular hexagonal pits on a desert viper abdomen were prepared by high-speed milling and controlling the ratio of row spacing to feed rate. The tribological behaviors of finite element models with smooth grinding and different bionic pit shapes were numerically simulated. The wear test was performed on the wear sample using a friction and wear test bench, and the wear morphology of the sample surface was observed using an ultra-depth of field three-dimensional microscope. The results show that under the condition of dry sliding friction, the rectangular pit surface imitating the dung beetle body surface has better drag reduction and wear resistance. The surface energy of the rectangular pits on the body surface of dung beetles can significantly improve the surface friction stress and temperature distribution, and reduce the wear of hardened steel molds. Furthermore, the friction and wear tests demonstrate good characteristics of debris collection and storage; thus, reducing the friction resistance."
610,Synthesis and characterization of copper hydroxynitrate salt (Cu(OH)NO): Effect of gamma radiation absorbed doses on thermal stability,2019-09-01,"Thermal stability is one of the main preferred material properties for industrial applications. Gamma radiation has a high ability to deeply penetrate in structure of materials and develop their physical properties. This work is devoted to sensitize copper hydroxynitrate Cu2(OH)3NO3, and study the effect of different doses of gamma rays on its thermal stability. The sample was prepared by co-precipitation technique and identified using X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The prepared sample was divided to seven subsamples, six of them were irradiated by different doses from 10 KGy up to 300 KGy while the seventh one used as a reference sample. The obtained results showed significant enhancement of thermal stability which represented by shifts of onset temperature to higher values for the irradiated samples from 10 to 100 kGy. Also, temperature corresponding to the residual masses 5%, 15% and 25% increased with increasing gamma radiation dose. However, the thermal stability reduced for the sample irradiated with high dose (300 KGy). The obtained data could be explained in terms of the principle of free radicals formation beside the interaction of these free radicals with each other. The obtained results shed light on the positive effect of the selective dose of gamma radiation for enhancement of the thermal stability of chemical structures."

In order to reduce the complexity of the problem, we provide a search computing model based on DNA origami to solve it. In this paper, we map the choice of each item to the directed path on the origami base of DNA. Then the solution of the problem is mapped to find a directed path to maximize the total value of items in the knapsack.

613,"Density functional theory study of structural, magnetic and spectral properties of the CrFe ( + = 6) and CrFeCu ( + = 5) clusters",2019-09-01,"Using Density functional theory (DFT) to study the geometries, stability, magnetic properties and infrared spectroscopy of Cr m Fe n  (m + n = 6) and Cr m Fe n Cu (m + n = 5) clusters at the BP86/SDD level. The ground state structures of Cr m Fe n  (m + n = 6) and Cr m Fe n Cu (m + n = 5) clusters are determined according to the principles of lowest energy and no virtual frequency. On this basis, the structural and chemical stabilities are obtained by the average binding energies (E b), chemical hardness (η) and HOMO-LUMO energy gap (E g). The average binding energies show the substitution of a copper atom is beneficial to improve the structural stability; It can be seen Cr4Fe2 and Cr3Fe2Cu have the best chemical stability in the two cluster series from the chemical hardness and HOMO-LUMO energy gap. By calculating the magnetic moment, it is shown that Cr5Fe and CrFe4Cu have large magnetic moments, which can be understood by the spin distribution. Finally, infrared spectroscopy of the clusters are calculated, we find a copper atom substitutes the Cr m Fe n  (m + n = 6) does not change the range of vibration frequency a lot because it does not significantly change the molecular structure of the original cluster, but it changes the vibration mode of the original cluster, resulting in the strongest infrared absorption peak intensity of Cr3Fe2Cu being lower than that of Cr3Fe3."
614,Influences of graphene oxide addition on mechanical properties of aramid fiber reinforced composites,2019-09-01,"In this paper, the graphene oxide (GO) was prepared by the modified Hummers' method in advance, and the obtained GO was used as a kind of filler added into the epoxy resin (EP) system (including the EP and corresponding curing agent) with different contents (relative to the total weight of the GO-EP system hybrid) ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 wt% to improve the mechanical properties of the aramid fiber reinforced composites (AFRC) through the autoclave forming technology. Then, a series of mechanical properties of the AFRC were measured according to the relevant test standards. Results showed that partial mechanical properties of the AFRC, especially the interlayer property, changed with the different contents of GO. Nevertheless, the tensile strength and tensile modulus of the AFRC presented no obvious changes for different contents of GO. Overall, the matrix phase EP system modified by the GO played an important role in the interlayer toughness of AFRC without reducing its tensile property. This was because the addition of the small amount of GO could prevent the generation of stress concentrations caused by the gaps between the reinforcing phase aramid fibers (AFs) and matrix phase EP system owing to their poor bondings."

Micro-crosslinking was introduced in the PC molecules and the ester groups in crosslinker can form carboxyl groups in the hydration solution of cement. The micro-crosslinked PC (MPC) superplasticizer was synthesized from butenyl alkylenepolyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene ether, sodium methacrylate, acrylic acid with trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) as the crosslinker in water medium. The effect of monomer content and the dosage of crosslinker on the performance of MPC were studied. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering analyses were conducted to characterize the molecular structure of MPC. The fluidity of mortar in 1 hour was tested to study the fluidity and the retention in fluidity of mortar with the presence of MPC, indicating that micro-crosslinking with trifunctional crosslinker TMPTA was an effective way to improve the fluidity retention without sacrificing the initial fluidity. Investigations on early hydration of cement with MPCs were performed using XRD and TGA. Results showed that the addition of MPCs can slightly improve the degree of early hydration."

The microstructure observation was carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The corrosion was characterized by weight loss method (WLM), open circuit potential (OCP) and potentiodynamic polarization curve (PPC) measurements. The results show that compared to the as-received specimens, the corrosion potential moves to the negative direction and corrosion current density increases after pre-deformation. The corrosion susceptibility is enhanced by the pre-deformation behavior, which is attributed to the increase in dislocation density with the increasing tensile elongation."
619,Effects of Pokemon combined with survivin and cyclin B1 on glioma U251 cells by FeO magnetic nanoparticles,2019-09-01,"Gliomas are the most common type of malignant brain tumors. Glioma diagnosis is not very effective, and there are few therapeutic biomarkers. The aims of this study were to detect Pokemon and its regulatory genes and explore the potential mechanism between them in glioma. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles identified using TEM were used to isolate cell and tissue RNA, qRT-PCR was used to detect Pokemon, survivin, and cyclin B1 mRNA expression. Western blotting was used to detect Pokemon, survivin, and cyclin B1 protein expression. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry were used to detect Pokemon expression. CCK-8 assay, EdU staining, and TUNEL staining were used to assess cell viability and apoptosis. Pokémon was over-expressed in human glioma tissue and cells. In U251 cells, Pokemon knockdown significantly decreased survivin and cyclin B1 expression, cell viability, and Pokemon expression and increased apoptosis. Pokemon overexpression had an opposite effect. In addition, over-expressed Pokemon reversed these results. Overall, we found that Pokemon promotes tumorigenesis, and the potential mechanism might be related to the Pokemon-related genes survivin and cyclin B1."
620,An investigation of the mechanism and benefits of ultrasonic vibration-assisted drilling of hard brittle materials such as Hotan jade,2019-09-01,"The ultrasonic vibration-assisted drilling process and the surface micro characteristics of Hotan jade were evaluated in detail. Because of the special physical properties of Hotan jade, traditional machining methods have great limitations. In consequence, it is difficult to achieve the required precision and surface quality. In this study, the physical properties of Hotan jade were considered and its unique cutting and machinability characteristics were evaluated for comparison purposes. The design principles of UV drilling and the important components of such a system were examined. The material removal mechanism of UV drilling was evaluated in detail. Finally, comparative tests using UV drilling and traditional drilling were carried on Hotan jade. The test results were evident from the degree of tool wear, degree of reaming, the extent of damage at the entrance to the drilled hole, the outlet burr and the roughness of the hole surface. The results of the machining trials confirmed that UV drilling not only was an easier process, but the straightness of the hole could be guaranteed, and the machined quality and drilling efficiency usually were better than was the case using traditional machining."

622,Phytotoxicity of graphene oxide on rice plants is concentration-dependent,2019-09-01,"Graphene significantly affects seeds germination and seedling growth of food plants. Phytotoxicity tests by seeds germination and seedling growth are important means to detect toxicity of graphene oxide. We in this study assessed the effect of graphene oxide on rice plants at low concentration. Graphene oxide significantly inhibited water absorption during 3–6 h soaking, postponed seeds germination, but significantly decreased seeds germination rate under 10 μg/mL treatment. Graphene oxide showed most destructive effect on root than upper ground part, and severely restrained root development and increased chlorophyll content. Moreover, graphene oxide enhanced superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase activities, and the change could alleviate oxygen damage. All these results indicate graphene oxide has some concentration-dependent phytotoxicity on seeds germination and seedling development, but also decreases damage by improving activities of antioxidant enzymes."

After annealing, the nanocrystalline matrix of the alloys changed slightly, and the average grain size remained as approximately 20 nm. Owing to the changes in the distribution and shape of the second phase, the annealed nanocrystalline Fe–Al–Cr alloys with different chromium contents provided good plasticity and strength. The annealed Fe–Al–Cr alloy with 15 wt.% chromium achieved the best comprehensive mechanical properties."
624,Fe–Ni alloy coatings on carbon fiber reinforced carbon matrix composite with an enhanced interface prepared through ultrasound-assisted electrodeposition,2019-09-01,"Fe–Ni alloys with low thermal expansion coefficients were deposited on carbon fiber reinforced carbon matrix composite (C/C composite) as metallization coatings via ultrasound-assisted electrodeposition. The interface was compact at the micrometer scale, and the micro-cracks and pores on the composite surface were fully filled with the deposited alloy. The interface shear strength reached 16.24 MPa, which was a significant improvement in comparison with that of the conventional electrodeposition. These results may have been due to the residual stress reduction, the joining area increasement, and the pinning effect enhancement."
625,Augmentation of ferromagnetism in CuO–AlO nanocomposite synthesized via solution combustion method,2019-09-01,The finite size effect of CuO nanoparticles and their effect on the magnetic behavior of a CuO–Al2O3 nanocomposite synthesized via a solution combustion method are discussed here. It is observed that the introduction of CuO nanoparticles of ∼20 nm in size on the surfaces of Al2O3 nanosheets strongly influences the magnetic moment of the nanocomposite. The X-ray diffraction pattern reveals the presence of a CuO phase in the CuO–Al2O3 nanocomposite. Electron microscopy imaging shows the presence of CuO nanoparticles distributed over the surfaces of Al2O3 nanosheets. Magnetic measurements performed at 5 and 300 K revealed a strong enhancement in the saturation magnetization of the CuO–Al2O3 nanocomposite at both temperatures. This increase is due to the formation of CuO nanoparticles on the surfaces of the Al2O3 nanosheets. These CuO nanoparticles show a ferromagnetic nature due to the uncompensated surface Cu2+ spins of the copper ions. The presence of the Cu2+ state in the CuO nanoparticles in the CuO–Al2O3 nanocomposite was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements.
626,"Preparation, structure and flame retardancy of poly(butylene terephthalate) with gradient intumescent flame retardant distribution",2019-09-01,"In this manuscript, the content-gradient distributions of an intumescent flame retardant (IFR) island-shaped structure in poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) were prepared using compression sintering processing technology inspired by powder metallurgy, to achieve efficient flame retardancy and mechanical properties with low flame retardant dosage. The PBT/IFR master-batch was first prepared by extrusion and then pulverized into powder. At low temperature (20 °C below the melting temperature) and high pressure (≥ 50 MPa) sintering processing conditions, two PBT/IFR powders with different levels of IFR content were fabricated into restricted island-like structure composites. The island with a higher IFR content exhibited flame retardancy, while the island with lower IFR content maintained the mechanics of the matrix. Compared with the uniform dispersion PBT/20 wt% IFR composite, the combustion of the PBT/IFR (25 wt%:15 wt% = 1:1) gradient content composite improved from V-1 to V-0 using a UL-94 test, while the tensile strength increased by 10%. The performance of the flame retardant was improved by periodically changing its distribution in the polymer matrix via restricted island-like structures fabricated using compression sintering processing technology inspired by powder metallurgy."
627,Study on the properties of coal-based high-purity graphite,2019-09-01,"As one of the major value-added products of coal processing and utilization, coal pitch coke and coal tar pitch are used as raw materials to prepare high-purity graphite. The structure characteristics and properties were measured by experiments. The results show that the high-purity graphite has excellent physical properties: the skeletal density of 1.81–1.91 g/cm3, the Shore hardness of 45.5–66.6 Hs, the flexural strength of 33.0–46.1 MPa, the compressive strength of 65.6–75.8 MPa, the ash content of 67–181 ppm, the thermal expansion coefficient of 3.71–4.11 × 10–6/°C, and the electrical resistivity of 8.72–12.13 μΩ · m. Consequently, coal-based graphite materials have excellent properties and good application prospects in solar energy industry, which is an effective exploration for the transformation and upgrading of Chinese coal industry."
628,Synthesis and morphology control of nano-scaled magnesium hydroxide and its influence on the mechanical property and flame retardancy of polyvinyl alcohol,2019-09-01,"Nano-scaled magnesium hydroxide with the special appearance was synthesized by a water precipitation reaction at room temperature. The effects of surfactant, reaction time, reactant concentration on the morphology of nano-scaled magnesium hydroxide were investigated. The nanocomposite film was prepared by adding nano-sized magnesium hydroxide to polyvinyl alcohol. The mechanical property and flame retardancy of PVA nanocomposites were tested. The results showed that the mechanical properties and flame retardancy of the composite film were improved by adding nano-powders."
629,A study on preparation and mechanism of Ni based ternary alloy,2019-09-01,"In this paper, the preparation of Ni–Ti–Nb amorphous alloy materials made by mechanical alloying method has been studied. The Ni–Ti–Nb mixed powders obtained by different mechanical alloying times have been analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that the Ni–Ti–Nb mixed powders can be mechanically alloyed after milling for 10 hours, and retained with ball milling. Continuously, Ni, Ti and Nb alloy powders diffuse with each other. When the diffusion rate increases to a certain extent, it is too late to form an ordered structure and form a Ni–Ti–Nb amorphous alloy. The stress and displacement curves are obtained by testing the tensile strength at room temperature. The stress changes of the restrained curves are relatively stable when the displacement is 6–18 mm, and the stress changes of the unconstrained curves show a distinct upward trend when the displacement is 6–18 mm, indicating that the strength of the specimens treated with restraint is higher than that of the specimens treated with restraint. This is due to the high internal stress of the material caused by the restraint and the decrease in the tensile strength of the alloy material."
630,Preparation and study of Fe–Co–Zr–B nano-soft magnetic alloy,2019-09-01,"The mechanical alloying of Fe–Co–Zr–B mixed powder has been studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and other test methods. The results show that the Fe–Co–Zr–B nanocrystalline alloy can be produced by mechanical alloying from the elements powders by ball milling of 50 h. With the increase in Co content, the grain size increases correspondingly, and the size of composite particles decreases continuously. The mechanical alloying process of Fe–Co–Zr–B alloy system is slowed down by the addition of Co."
631,Research progress of packaging indicating materials for real-time monitoring of food quality,2019-08-01,"The rapid development of cold-chain transportation necessitates consumers to present high requirements on safety and freshness of fresh food in recent years. The quality and taste of fresh food can be monitored and controlled through the intelligent packaging technologies and new food packaging materials such as time-temperature indicators (TTIs), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), biological composites and polymer nanocomposites. Based on different packaging materials, indicators and sensors are employed in food packaging for real-time detection of information about freshness, temperature, microbiological, and shelf life of products in the supply chain. Wide varieties of packaging materials are suitable for providing intelligent and smart properties for food packaging, such as oxygen scavenging capability, antimicrobial activity, and recording the thermal history. Due to the special properties of prepared materials, TTIs are used to point out the remaining shelf life of perishable products throughout the supply chain. Compared with others, they have the advantages of low cost, small size and convenient indication. Additionally, the TTIs can effectively solve food quality and safety problems caused by temperature fluctuation in supply chain. Since the irreversible color change of TTIs, the food safety situation would be shown intuitively. Currently, the TTIs were widely used in application of food packaging by providing safety information. However, the application is also accompanied with some deficiencies such as the accuracy of monitoring, migration of toxic substances, stability and expensive cost etc. This review will deeply discuss the preparation of various types of TTIs based on different package indicating materials with a particular emphasis on how to improve their accuracy and stability, control the migration of toxic substances and to develop new TTIs."
632,Realization of a tunable double layer metamaterial absorber in terahertz,2019-08-01,"A tunable terahertz metamaterial absorber with four Dirac semimetal strips and a Dirac semimetal square is numerically studied. An absorption peak (72.5%) is achieved at resonant frequency 1.51 THz based on the local surface plasmons mode resonance on edges of Dirac semimetal square and strips synchronously. Absorption peak can be enhanced by optimizing the vertical (W1) or horizontal distance (W2) between Dirac semimetal strips and square. Moreover, new absorption resonance properties are obtained (new absorption peaks and bands). when W1 = 320 nm, a new unit cell ""Structure 2"" is obtained. And when W2 = 320 nm, a new unit cell ""Structure 3"" is also achieved. The absorption peak is also can be enhanced through changing the Fermi energy or the temperature. Finally, this proposed absorber shows high performance properties under the incidence angle 60°."
633,"Effect of extrusion treatment on mechanical, thermal conductivity and corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys",2019-08-01,"The effect of extrusion treatment on the mechanical, thermal and corrosion resistance of Mg–La–Zn–Zr alloys were presented. It is suggested that the amount of recrystallized grains played a major role in both mechanical properties and thermal properties. It should be noted the as-cast alloy shows the best thermal conductivity reached the value about 137.507 W/(m · K), however, the mechanical performance of magnesium alloys does not reach the expected results. The thermal properties of extruded alloys have slightly decreased and then increased with the increase of extrusion temperature. Then the tensile properties of Mg–La–Zn–Zr were significantly improved after extrusion treatment. Furthermore, with the increase of extrusion temperature, the elongation-to-fracture increased substantially. After extrusion treatment, the corrosion driving force of the alloy decreases, which reduces the corrosion tendency of the magnesium alloy. The alloy presented in this paper is expected to be applied in industry."
634,Preparation of ZnS quantum dot photocatalyst and study on photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics,2019-08-01,"In this paper, ZnS quantum dot nanomaterials were prepared by means of hydrothermal method and the structure and morphology of the prepared samples were characterized by XRD and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). At the same time, the photocatalytic properties of ZnS quantum dots were studied using antibiotic contaminants ciprofloxacin (CIP) in the environment as the object of degradation. The study showed that the successfully prepared ZnS quantum dot has good photocatalytic property under UV irradiation, it can effectively degrade the antibiotic contaminant ciprofloxacin in the environment, but its catalytic performance under visible light is not high and its degradation efficiency is only 45.75%."
635,Exploration on the adsorption mechanism of aminopyrimidines and quinazoline compounds on graphene oxide: Hydrophobicity and structure-controlled release process,2019-08-01,"In this study, graphene oxide was synthesized using the Hummers method, and stable and homogeneous graphene oxide aqueous solutions were obtained through mechanical stirring and ultrasonic stripping. In conjunction with our previous studies, graphene oxide-loaded insoluble compound delivery systems were prepared to verify the in vivo release profiles of the graphene oxide delivery system. Several insoluble compounds including imatinib, nilotinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib were selected for loading and in vitro graphene oxide release assays to study the non-covalent adsorption mechanisms. Computer simulations were employed for validation processes. For in vivo release assays, the T 1/2 values of the poorly water soluble groups were 1.104 ± 0.18 h and the C max was 2.600 ± 2.06 mg/L. In previous assays, compounds with high water solubility supported by graphene oxide were released and detected in vivo. The solubility of the compound and its binding force with the carrier played a crucial role in release. The results of graphene oxide loading experiments showed that the maximum loading and entrapment efficiencies of the insoluble model compounds with similar aromatic rings were comparable. Under basic conditions, the in vitro release rates and maximum release levels of amino pyrimidine were elevated. In contrast, quinazoline release declined. Combined with computer simulations, π–π stacking was identified as the dominant mechanism for adsorption onto graphene oxide. Both hydrogen bonding and cation-π bonds played an auxiliary reinforcing role, and the two were regarded as antagonistic."
636,Influence of the crack area on the crack-healing performance of silicon carbide whisker reinforced silicon nitride composite,2019-08-01,"The crack healing properties of Si3N4 composite ceramic reinforced by SiC whiskers (Si3N4/SiC w ) was studied. Six kinds of pre-cracks were introduced on the center of the tensile side of the specimens, and the relationship between the crack area and crack healing properties was studied. The results show that the healing effect of strength recovery is similar with that of smooth specimens for pre-cracked specimens with crack depth less than 60 μm. As for the propagated crack and the central through crack, the strength recovery rapidly decreases due to the increase of crack depth. It could be concluded that it is difficult to heal pre-cracked specimens with the crack depth over 90 μm. The main reason is considered to be that the melted glass phase blocked in the surface, and prevented the oxidation reaction in the inner of crack."
637,Facile synthesis of TiO film on glass for the photocatalytic removal of rhodamine B and tetracycline hydrochloride,2019-08-01,"Photocatalysis is one of the efficient approaches for pollution control in water. However, the traditional photocatalysts used for the removal of organic pollutants are in powder form, which makes it difficult to recover them from the suspended reaction system. On the contrary, thin film photocatalyst is easy to be retrieved and possesses unique feature for practical application. In present work, stable TiO2 sol suspension was prepared and amorphous TiO2 thin film was then immobilized upon glass substrate through facile spin coating method. The thickness of film could be simply controlled by changing the number of coatings, and anatase TiO2 film could be formed after calcination. The prepared thin films were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultravioletvisible spectrophotometry (UV-vis), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The photodegradations of organic pollutants including colored dye and colorless antibiotic were tested and found to be thickness-dependent. Additionally, the prepared film photocatalst has good stability and may have potential applications in wastewater treatment."
638,A sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor using polythionine/AuNPs nanocomposites as label for ultrasensitive detection of carcinoembryonic antigen,2019-08-01,"A sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor was developed in this study for sensitive detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) based on rGO/CS/AuNPs as a sensing platform and PTh-Au composites as signal labels. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO), Chitosan (CS) and AuNPs were layer by layer modified on glass carbon electrode (GCE), which effectively enhanced electron transfer and provided excellent large electrochemical active surface area. Polythionine-Au composites prepared by chemical reduction method greatly amplified electrochemical signal with high conductivity and large surface area. The prepared immunosensor showed high sensitivity, good stability and selectivity for detection of CEA with a wide range of 0.3 ng/mL to 30 ng/mL (R 2 = 0.9972) and a detection limit as low as 0.1471 pg/mL. Furthermore, this sandwich-type immunosensor might be as a versatile platform for reliable early cancer diagnostics clinical."
639,Characteristics of prepared fenpropathrin nano-emulsion and research on glutathione S-transferase enzymatic activity and penetration performance on ,2019-08-01,"In this study, fenpropathrin nano-emulsion (NE) was prepared by phase inversion emulsification method. 8% xylene and 2% solvent oil 150 (The main component is 1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene) were used as solvent, styrylphenolpolyoxyethylene and calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate were used as surfactants. The particle size, zeta potential, conductivity and contact angle were detected to evaluate the characteristic of the nano-emulsion. Toxicity of fenpropathrin nano-emulsion on the pest mite, Tetranychus cinnabarinus, was analyzed. The particle sizes of 8% fenpropathrin nano-emulsion and 20% fenpropathrin emulsion concentrates (EC) were 31.53 nm and 459.00 nm, zeta potentials were –22 mV and 5.762 mV, respectively, which showed that the size of nanoemulsion was much smaller and its stability was higher than that of EC. The contact angles of these two formulations were tested in concentrations of 500 mg/L to 2000 mg/L. We found that the contact angle of NE at the same concentration was 32% lower than that of EC averagely. The results indicated that the wettability and adhesion ability of nano-emulsion droplets were better than those of EC on the biological targets. According to determination of penetration performance to T. cinnabarinus, it was found that the penetration performance of NE to T. cinnabarinus is 4–6 times higher than that of EC. With the characteristics above, the NE has exhibited higher biological activity on the T. cinnabarinus. The results of Glutathione-S-transferase (GSTs) enzymatic activity of T. cinnabarinus showed nano-emulsion had higher effects than EC. In conclusion, compared with EC, nano-emulsion has better penetration, biological activity and a great application prospect in pesticide field in the future."
640,miR-223 regulates proliferation and apoptosis by targeting insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) in osteosarcoma cells,2019-08-01,"MicroRNAs are widely involved in cancer progression by inhibiting the expression levels of oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes, and the dysregulation of microRNAs may contribute to tumorigenesis. Here, we use molecular-biology and cell-biology methods to determine the role of miR-223 in osteosarcoma (OS) regulation. The regulating effect of miR-223 on OS is determined by various experimental methods in vivo and in vitro. Exogenous miR-223 reduces the proliferation of HOS and MG-63 cells in vitro. In addition, we show that excessive expression of miR-223 significantly increases apoptosis of OS cells. Moreover, the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) is downgraded after using an miR-223 simulated transfection in HOS and MG-63 cells. After IGF-1R inhibition, the cell activity of the HOS and MG-63 cells is also inhibited. In addition, we demonstrate that miR-223 inhibits OS proliferation and induces apoptosis by targeting a point in IGF-1R 3′ -UTR. In summary, miR-223 inhibits OS proliferation and induces apoptosis by targeting IGF-1R. New therapies with fewer complications based on miRNAs should be studied."
641,On-demand drug release and re-absorption from pirarubicin loaded FeO@ZnO core–shell nanoparticles for targeting infusion chemotherapy for urethral carcinoma,2019-08-01,"Although standard treatment recommendations for urethral carcinoma are lacking due to its rare incidence, urethral infusion chemotherapy can be a good choice for urethral carcinoma therapy which minimizes damage to patients compared to radical cystourethrectomy and radiation therapy. In this work, pirarubicin loaded Fe3O4@ZnO core–shell nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized. They can magnetically position in a tubular structure at will and realized on-demand pirarubicin release and re-absorption under UV radiation and darkness. As a result, they can strongly inhibit the human urethral squamous carcinoma cells during infusion chemotherapy and give nearly no damage to normal cells after infusion chemotherapy. Overall, such nanoparticles are highly possible to be a new approach for urethral carcinoma infusion chemotherapy, with satisfactory efficacy and slight side effects."
642,Study on bioactive molecules involved in extracellular biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles by  Su1,2019-08-01,"In this paper, the biosynthesis of high-stable and biocompatible silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was implemented by employing cell-free filtrate of Penicillium aculeatum Su1. The compositions analysis of reducing biomolecules in reaction system before and after AgNPs synthesis suggested that proteins were mainly involved in the biosynthesis process of AgNPs. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis displayed that two main protein bands with molecular weights ranging from 66.2 to 116 KDa and 35 to 45 KDa were capped on the surface of AgNPs. The further identification of these protein bands by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis indicated that actin as a major protein component was responsible for stabilization of prepared AgNPs. The activity of nitrate reductase secreted by P. aculeatum Su1 was 73.73 ± 3.89 μg/(g · h). Furthermore, the dialysis assay showed that small molecular components had significant impacts on yield and particle size of biosynthesized AgNPs. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADH or NADPH)-dependent nitrate reductases and other types of reductases or non-enzymatic bioactive molecules (≥ 3.5 KDa) might simultaneously participate in the biosynthesis process of AgNPs mediated by P. aculeatum Su1."
643,Establishment of rapid diagnostic method for the identification of  in bacterial conjunctivitis,2019-08-01,"Staphylococcus aureus is the most frequent cause of conjunctivitis and may lead to severe visual impairment. However, the tools available for the diagnosis, such as bacterial culture and cytology, are often inadequate. Therefore, the goal of the present work was to establish a rapid detection method for S. aureus in the secretions of the conjunctival sac to provide a basis for the early diagnosis of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. The study included 32 patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis, 30 patients with viral conjunctivitis, and 28 control subjects. Extracted DNA was analyzed by conventional PCR and RT-PCR using primers specific for S. aureus DNA and two antibiotic resistance genes, mecA and femB. By this technique, S. aureus was found in 37.5% of patients with bacterial conjunctivitis, 20% of patients with viral conjunctivitis, and in 7.1% normal control subjects. Except for the control group in which the femB gene was not found, in most other cases S. aureus carried mecA and femB genes. The developed molecular biology approach is faster and more sensitive than the methods requiring bacterial cultures and is uniquely suited for the detection of an S. aureus infection in the eye."
644,Effect of smoking on colonization by  in patients with chronic periodontitis,2019-08-01,"Bacteroides forsythus is the least investigated species of the ""red complex"" of bacteria responsible for periodontitis. This is due, at least in part, to the difficulty in identifying these bacteria by classic techniques requiring in vitro cultures. Thus, the aim of the current study was to design a fast and robust technique for the detection of B. forsythus. For this purpose, DNA was isolated by magnetic microbeads from dental plaque and gingival crevical fluid, and the presence of the gene coding for 16S rRNA of B. forsythus was detected by conventional of quantitative real-time PCR. The study enrolled patients affected by periodontitis and healthy subjects, and both groups were comprised of heavy and mild smokers. The assays revealed that bot gingival fluid and dental plaque served well as the material for test samples. The periodontitis group had a markedly higher rate of infection by B. forsythus than healthy subjects. The infection rate was also higher in the group of smokers but did not depend on whether the patients were heavy or mild smokers. In conclusion, the novel methodology may become a powerful tool in the hands of clinicians, allowing them to obtain a faster and more accurate diagnosis of B. forsythus in periodontal infections."
645,Enhanced thermoelectric properties in nanowires of InAs modulated with multiple-stub structures,2019-08-01,"The thermoelectric properties of InAs nanowires modulated with the multiple-stub structures are studied using the scattering-matrix method. Owing to the very large surface-to-volume ratio, both the phonon and electron transport sensitively depend on the geometric structure. Carrier energy filtering which locally distorts electronic density of states strongly enhances the thermopower. Thus optimized thermopower, together with the significant reduction of the phonon thermal conductance, yields the high thermoelectric figure of merit ZT to 0.3∼1.9."
646,"Facile preparation of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)/graphene oxide nanocomposite for electrochromic applications",2019-08-01,"An aqueous electrochromic composite poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)/graphene oxide was prepared in this study by a simple one-step in-situ polymerization. This simple one-step preparation method allowed the composite to achieve good performance without post-treatment. When the composite was coated on the indium tin oxide using as electrochromic film, it exhibited a noticeable electrochromism with reversible color changes from light blue to dark blue, and showed a wider range of discoloration (33%). The composite owns a larger diffusion coefficient of lithium ions (2.95 × 10–15 cm2 s–1) and better cycling performance compared with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) film."
647,Effects of diverse materials-based methods on DNA extraction for  from stool samples,2019-08-01,"Nosocomial infections, including Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), and their fatality rates have increased in the past few decades. Despite emerging molecular diagnostic technologies with rapid, accurate outcomes, nucleic acid extraction from stool samples remains the first limiting step before downstream applications. Commercial nucleic acid extraction kits greatly decrease labor and time requirements, and also provide nucleic acid preparations with higher quality and purity for enzyme digestion analysis or genotyping. The magnetic bead based technique is a novel method compared with the conventional spin-column method, and currently has widespread use in nucleic acid extraction. We evaluated five DNA extraction kits with magnetic beads using materials with various properties (particle size, concentration of magnetic beads, grinding beads) and reagents (proteinase K, lysozyme, isopropanol, and absolute ethanol) to determine the cost, hands-on time, number of essential operations, and quality and purity of the DNA preparations, compared with those obtained using the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit. The six DNA extraction kits yielded A 260/280 ratios ranging from 0.85 to 1.9 (average 1.57), and concentrations from 3.70 to 108.09 ng/μL (average 34.64 ng/μL). All the DNA samples had acceptable downstream application effects, except for those obtained using the TIANGEN Magnetic Soil and Stool DNA Kit. However, gel electrophoresis analysis of the DNA samples resulted in a light strip on the gel, indicating that the proteinaceous contaminant may not have been removed completely. A rapid and accurate molecular diagnostic technique could allow for more suitable treatment and prognosis outcomes for inpatients, depending, in large part, on the quality and purity of DNA preparations, which are frequently neglected. Our study focused on the quality of commercial kits with a primary focus on the treatment of stool samples and molecular diagnostic applications."
648,Atractylenolide II-ameliorated hyperlipidemia in mice by regulating  signaling pathway,2019-08-01,"In this paper, we present our study on the effect of atractylenolide II on hyperlipidemic model mice. After 8 weeks, the blood of these mice was taken to detect four lipids. Pathological changes were detected in the aortas and livers of the mice. Expression of PPARα and SREBP-1C was detected in the liver by western blot. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the effects of atractylenolide II on blood lipids in hyperlipidemia mice. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to detect pathological changes in the aortas and livers of mice with hyperlipidemia after treatment with atractylenolide II. Changes in PPARα and SREBP-1C expression were found in mice with dyslipidemia. As the results shown, atractylenolide II administration reduced body weight and hyperlipidemia in hyperlipidemic model mice. In addition, atractylenolide II effectively relieved fat deposition and damage in aortic and liver tissues. Therefore, atractylenolide II had a beneficial therapeutic effect in reducing hyperlipidemia in hyperlipidemic model mice, which may be related to its ability to inhibit SREBP-1C expression by activating PPARα. The molecular mechanism driving the therapeutic effect of atractylenolide II may involve upregulation of PPARα and activation of the AMPK/PPARα/SREBP-1C signaling pathway. Our research demonstrated the development of therapeutic agents that can be used to improve hyperlipidemia."
649,Morphology controlled deposition of ZnO single micro-nanorods,2019-08-01,"The ZnO micro-nanorods are controlledly synthesized by a simple chemical vapor deposition method. With different oxygen concentrations the micro-nanorods exhibit different extrinsic feature and length. Under lower oxygen concentration, the micro-nanorods are up to 1670 μm in length which can be easily operated in singlecrystalline. When the oxygen concentration up to 30 sccm, the surface of the sample is smoother. The Raman spectra reveal that ZnO micro-nanorods have an excellent hexagonal wurtzite structure. However, the micronanorods synthesized during lower oxygen concentration exhibit more oxygen defect. The morphology controlling deposition of ZnO mircro-nanorods were realized by adjust the concentration of oxygen, which has great significance for further gas sensor application."
650,Densification process of silica microspheres by multi-step sintering,2019-08-01,"Dense silica microspheres were fabricated by spray drying and multi-step sintering. The effect of sinter temperatures on densification, dispersibility and inner morphology of silica spheres was analyzed by SEM, and the densification process was deeply discussed. The results showed that single-step sintering at 1100 °C made silica spheres seriously coherent each other and spherical morphology irregular. However, a multi-step process made the sinter temperature increase to 1190 °C, while silica spheres still kept uniformly spherical and dispersed. The increased temperature resulted in that the silica particles obtained dense inner morphology, and their density reached 2.18 g · cm–3, corresponding to a relative density of 98.6% (in comparison with the density of 2.21 g · cm–3 for noncrystal silica)."
651,Improvement in the electrochemical catalytic performance of fuel cell catalysts by controlling the size of carbon nanotubes as a catalyst carrier by centrifugation,2019-06-01,"A novel and very effective method to improve the electrochemical performance of fuel cells catalysts was developed. First, different sizes of polypyrimidine coated carbon nanotubes (Polypyrimidine/CNT) were separated by different centrifugal speeds (7, 18, 35, 72 g), and platinum particles were deposited on the hybrids to prepare fuel cell catalysts. The catalyst has good catalytic performance when the composite is sized-controlled at a speed of 18 g. Then, the pure carbon nanotubes in the Pt based polyaniline coated single-walled carbon nanutubes catalyst (PANI/CNT/Pt) were replaced with the size-controlled composite at a centrifugal speed of 18 g to prepare a binary catalyst (PANI/polypyrimidine/CNT 18/Pt). The electrochemical active area (ECSA) value of the catalyst prepared by this method was successfully increased by about 2 times compared with PANI/CNT/Pt, and the oxidation of methanol of the catalyst were effectively improved."
652,Effects of Nb additions on structure and mechanical properties evolution of CoCrNi medium-entropy alloy,2019-06-01,"A serious medium-entropy alloys (MEAs), CrCoNiNb x  (x = 0–0.5 mole ratio), was designed by adding Nb element into CrCoNi matrix to investigate alloying effects of large atom Nb on the phase evolution, microstructural and their impacts on the subsequent mechanical properties. It was found that Nb element addition into the CoCrNi MEAs changed the original phase constitution and led to the formation of an ordered Nb-riched Laves phase with HCP structure embedded in the FCC matrix. The current alloy system structure evolved from hypoeutectic (x < 0.4), to eutectic (x = 0.4), then to hypereutectic (x > 0.4) with Nb content increases. Laves phase volume fraction increase is mainly responsible for the increment in the hardness and compression yield strength, and the decrement in the fracture strain. This strategy to obtain the balance of strength and ductility by adding a certain element will provide a new design idea for FCC type MEAs engineering applications."
653,Influence of mica particles as secondary reinforcement on the mechanical and wear properties of Al/BC/mica composites,2019-06-01,"The present investigation is to study the influence of Mica as secondary reinforcement particles on ultimate tensile strength, yield strength and elongation of Al/B4C/mica hybrid composites of 1 and 3 weight% of mica. It also focuses on microstructure of Al/B4C and Al/B4C/mica hybrid composites. The investigation reveals that the mica particles improve the yield strength by 5.85% and ultimate tensile strength by 3.9% on Al/12%B4C/3%mica hybrid composite consequently reducing its elongation by 11.62%. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) microstructure reveals that the mica particles improve the interface between the matrix and B4C particles. Also this study focuses on the wear characteristics such as wear rate and coefficient of friction on Al6061/8%B4C and Al6061/8%B4C/mica hybrid composites. A dry sliding wear test was carried out at varying process parameters namely load and wt.% of secondary reinforcement. The pin-on-disc wear test was carried out at the load of 9.81 N, 19.62 N and 29.43 N on a specimen prepared by stir cast technique. The size of the reinforcement particle is 40–60 μm and 3–10 μm for B4C and mica respectively. A study was carried out on the worn surface of the composites using SEM. Moreover, the worn surface profiles of the composites were studied by atomic force microscope (AFM). The investigation reveals that Al6061/8%B4C/3%mica hybrid composites cause a reduction in wear rate up to 35.4% in comparison with Al6061/B4C composites at 9.81 N load. The coefficient of friction diminishes up to 5.55% at 19.62 N loads. Mica reinforced worn surface reveals that there is an improvement in the recasting of wear debris and smoothening of the surface."
654,Effect of excess Ca on the formation of CaZrO powders via polyacrylamide gel method,2019-06-01,"High-purity perovskite structure orthogonal phase CaZrO3 fine powders were synthesized via a simple, fast, low-cost, and eco-friendly method, known as the polyacrylamide gel (PAG) method. The starting materials are mixed and dissolved in water with a non-stoichiometry ratio of Ca2+/Zr4+ by excess Ca2+. The effects of the excess Ca on the phase formation of CaZrO3 powders were investigated. When the Ca2+ and Zr4+ are reacted with 1:1, 1.05:1 and 1.1:1 stoichiometries, a minor amount of non-stoichiometric calcium–zirconium oxide was frequently observed over the entire range of sintering temperatures from 550 °C to 1350 °C. Increasing the Ca2+/Zr4+ ratio can contribute to the reduction of non-stoichiometric calcium–zirconium oxide. When Ca2+ and Zr4+ are reacted with 1.15:1 stoichiometry, XRD patterns showed peaks corresponding to high-purity orthogonal-phase CaZrO3 after sintering at 1150 °C for 3 h. This result proved that excess Ca2+ contributes to solving the difficulty of removing impurities from CaZrO3 powder."
655,Photoelectrochemical aptasensor based on a ternary CdS/Au/TiO nanotube array for ultrasensitive detection of cytochrome c,2019-06-01,"A novel photoelectrode of ternary CdS/Au/TiO2 nanotube array, fabricated by electrodeposition technique and successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method, shows strong photon absorption capacity and active charge transfer efficiency. A photoelectrochemical aptasensor was developed to detect cytochrome c (cyt c) by decorating a HS-aptamer on the CdS/Au/TiO2 photoelectrode. Due to the specific binding between the cyt c and aptamer, the cyt c-aptamer complex formed and enhanced the steric hindrances and reduced the e/h + lifetimes, which result in a decrease in the photoelectrical current intensity. Cyt c is, therefore, also quantified based on the decrease in photoelectrical current. The developed aptasensor shows a high specificity and a high sensitivity towards to the cyt c, giving a linear range from 5 pM to 100 nM, and a limit of detection of 3.45 pM."
656,Role of interface quality in iron oxide core/shell nanoparticles on heating efficiency and transverse relaxivity,2019-06-01,"Core/shell Fe3O4 /γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles have been designed as a promising agent for magnetic hyperthermia and contrast agents for MRI imaging applications, because of their high magnetic moment and biocompatibility. Three sets of core/shell nanoparticles with the same core diameter of 8 nm and shell thicknesses of 1, 3 and 5 nm were synthesized by chemical coprecipitation. The nanoparticles were coated with PEG and the specific absorption rate for the nanoparticles was determined by applying 3.6 kA/m alternating magnetic field with 236 kHz frequency. The biocompatibility of the nanoparticles was confirmed by MTT assay. Three sets of nanoparticles presented in the study have shown the ability to kill 80–85% HeLa cells upon exposure to alternating magnetic field for 10 minutes in the presence of the nanoparticles. The transverse relaxivity of water protons for the three sets of the nanoparticles were obtained using 400 MHz Bruker NMR. The core/shell interface structure is found to be of poor quality because of interface defects which results in interface spin glass structures. The existence of the spin glass clusters suppresses the interface exchange coupling which leads to weak interface magnetic anisotropy. The insignificant role of core/shell structure on the heating efficiency is attributed to the insignificant contribution of the interface structure towards the effective anisotropy."
657,Effect of chain length of cardanol-based phenalkamines on mechanical properties of air-dried and heat-cured epoxies,2019-06-01,"Four cardanol-based phenalkamines (named PK1, PK2, PK3 and PK4, respectively) with different polyethylenepolyamine chain lengths were synthesized using ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine and pentaethylenehexamine, respectively, and then air-dried and heat-cured epoxies were prepared using these four phenalkamines as curing agents. The effects of the polyethylenepolyamine chain length on the mechanical and thermal properties of these epoxies were investigated. The adhesion and hardness of air-cured coatings, and the thermogravimetric analysis, dynamic mechanical properties, swelling degree and mechanical properties of heat-cured epoxies were investigated. The results show that the crosslinking density of cured epoxies calculated based on the dynamic mechanical results and rubber elasticity theory follows the order of DGEBA/PK1 <  DGEBA/PK3 <  DGEBA/PK2 <  DGEBA/PK4, which can be affected by many factors such as chain length, viscosity and phenalkamine dosage. The chain length of polyethylenepolyamines follows the order of PK1 <  PK2 <  PK3 <  PK4. A longer chain length contains more secondary amines, which can react with more epoxy groups and therefore form more tertiary amino groups. As a consequence, the curing reaction can be catalyzed during the epoxy-secondary amine reactions, resulting in a higher curing degree. A similar trend is observed in thermogravimetric analysis and mechanical properties, but an opposite trend is observed in swelling degree of epoxies. Thus, the epoxies cured by phenalkamines with a longer polyethylenepolyamine chain generally have better balanced mechanical and thermal properties."
658,Microwave-absorbing ability of super-paramagnetic ZnNiFeO nanoparticles for the X-band frequency range,2019-06-01,"Super-paramagnetic zinc nickel ferrite Zn0.8Ni0.2Fe2O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by hydrothermal method and dispersed into a SiO2 matrix to form a nanocomposite. Microwave-absorbing samples were prepared using carbon black and super-paramagnetic Zn0.8Ni0.2Fe2O4 dispersed into a SiO2 matrix and then blended with epoxy resin and coated with 2-mm thickness onto a steel substrate. The microwave absorption of the samples was measured over a frequency range of 8–12 GHz (X band frequency range). The Zn0.8Ni0.2Fe2O4 content (0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.75 wt.% of composite paint) affected the microwave absorption ability of the composite. Higher Zn0.8Ni0.2Fe2O4 content led to greater absorption in the X-band frequency range. The effect of the magnetic state of Zn0.8Ni0.2Fe2O4 nanoparticles on the microwave-absorbing ability for the X-band was also studied. The results showed the sample with 1.5 wt.% Zn0.8Ni0.2Fe2O4 (single domain structure) displayed –20.74 dB absorption (99.2% power attenuation) at 10 GHz; the sample with a ferri-magnetic, multi-domain structure and the same composition exhibited –5.94 dB absorption at 10 GHz (74.5% power attenuation)."
659,Effect of 3D printing direction and water storage on nano-mechanical properties of 3D printed and auto-polymerized polymer with special emphasis on printing layer interface,2019-06-01,This study evaluated and compared nano-mechanical properties of three-dimensional printed epoxy based photopolymer and conventional autopolymerized acrylic resin. The effects of observation of printing layers (parallel vs. perpendicular to the layer) and water storage on the nano-mechanical properties were studied. Three different groups of specimens measuring (2.0 × 2.0 × 25.0) mm3 were fabricated. Group 1 (n = 10) specimens were fabricated with horizontal printing direction and group 2 (n = 10) specimens were fabricated with vertical printing direction by additive manufacturing technology. Group 3 specimens were fabricated using conventional PMMA based autopolymerizing resin. The nano-mechanical properties were measured perpendicular and parallel to the printing layers using nano-indenter before and after water storage. The surface structure of representative experimental specimens were analyzed using scanning electron microscope with emphasis to the printing layer interface. Two-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) was used to compare the mean values before and after water storage at a significance level of p < 0.05. Highest values of the nano-mechanical properties were found by indentations perpendicular to the printing layer (Young's modulus: 3.739 ± 0.233 GPa; nano-hardness: 0.180 ± 0.022 GPa). The 3D printed specimens had higher nano-hardness and Young's modulus than conventional autopolymerized acrylic resin even after being stored in water for two weeks.
660,Development and characterization of novel fiber-metal-laminate (FML) using aluminium sheet and ceramic mat,2019-06-01,"In this investigation three novel fiber-metal-laminate (FML) combinations were developed and comprehensively characterized for structural applications. One mm thick aluminium sheets were bonded along with either ceramic mat or ceramic foam sheets using epoxy resin to form different laminate profiles by compression. The compression pressure and the quantity of resin were optimized to ensure good adhesion between the layers. The mechanical properties such as tensile strength, impact strength and hardness were analyzed as per the ASTM standards along with tribological and flammability characteristics. The mechanical strength in tension and dynamic conditions were good for the ceramic mat combinations due to its energy dissipation characteristics such as debonding of fiber and pull outs. However, the flammability characteristics of the ceramic mat laminate combination was poor due to the presence of epoxy coating done for bonding the layers of the laminates. The wear characteristics of aluminium layer was inferior, which was the feature for the laminates with outer aluminium layer. In summary, the obtained result shows that the material is durable and strong enough for many structural applications."
661,"Effect of eutectic coating on the microstructure, compression property and corrosion behavior of Mg–Li alloy fabricated by co-extrusion",2019-06-01,"An innovative and effective method was designed to fabricate eutectic coating on Mg–Li alloy by one step. The ""billet-on-billet extrusion"" process helps to prevent the formation of interfacial oxides during heating and hot extrusion. It is indicated that the excellent metallurgical bonding is formed between the eutectic coating and substrate. The uniform coating on composite rod is about 20 μm, with no obvious cracks or wavy interface surfaces. The eutectic coating is mainly composed of Mg17Al12, and the hardness is about 220 HV. The melting eutectic on the Mg–Li alloy can play the role of lubrication, which can accelerate the extrusion speed and promote microstructure uniformity. The results of the compression test indicate that the composite exhibit relatively high strength both at room temperature and high temperature compared with as-cast and regular extrusion bars. Compared with Mg–Li alloy, the corrosion potential of coating was increased significantly, and corrosion current density was decreased considerably, indicating that the corrosion resistance is obviously improved."
662,Temperature effect on the ground state energy and the longitudinal optical-phonon mean number of the impurity polaron in asymmetrical 2D RbCl semi-exponential quantum wells,2019-06-01,"The ground state energy (GSE) and the longitudinal optical phonons (LOPs) mean number of the hydrogen-like impurity polaron in an asymmetrical two-dimensional semi-exponential quantum well (SEQW) are examined theoretically. The temperature effects on the GSE and the LOPs mean number are first obtained by the quantum statistics theory (QST). Then the variations of the GSE and the LOPs mean number with the Coulombic impurity potential (CIP) are calculated by using Lee-Low-Pines unitary transformation (LLPUT) and linear combination operation (LCO) methods. Our results indicate that the temperature and the CIP have important influences on the GSE and the LOPs mean number. It shows that the GSE and the LOPs mean number will increase with increasing temperature. The LOPs mean number is an increasing function of the CIP strength, whereas the GSE is reducing one of it. In addition, it finds three ways of controlling the asymmetrical SEQW's GSE and the LOPs mean number via adjusting the temperature, the confinement strength and Coulomb potential."
663,CeO-based nanocomposites: An advanced alternative to TiO and ZnO in sunscreens,2019-06-01,"To encounter the increasing risk of melanoma as well as sunburns and premature ageing, tremendous efforts are being put forwarded by the researchers to improve the existing sunscreen materials used in cosmetics. Skin irritation and photoinstability issues of the organic filters motivate researchers to develop suitable alternatives based on inorganic oxides such as titanium dioxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO). Though these inorganic oxide-based UV filters are commonly used in sunscreens, their high oxidation catalytic activity, photocatalytic ability, toxicity, and unaesthetic formulations further encourage researchers to recognize other inorganic alternatives. In this direction, cerium oxide (CeO2)-based nanocomposites including CeO2 are considered to be attractive. However, catalytic oxidation is the prime limitation of such composites toward their applicability in commercial sunscreens. A thorough review of the attempts made by the researchers to understand such bottleneck of CeO2-based nanocomposites is thus essential. In this review article, the UV shielding ability of CeO2-based nanocomposites and CeO2 is primarily focused. In particular, the approaches taken so far to maximize the usefulness in terms of UV shielding, photostability, oxidation stability, and toxicity issues of CeO2-based nanocomposites as potential inorganic UV filters in commercial sunscreens over most common inorganic counterparts, i.e., TiO2 and ZnO are highlighted and emphasized."
664,"Synthesis, spectroscopic characterization and structural investigation of new charge-transfer complexes of piroxicam with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone and chloranilic acid: Experimental and theoretical studies",2019-06-01,"Charge transfer (CT) complexes have great scientific importance because they include wide applications in different fields, one of the most essential of these applications is to determine the activity of pharmacological compounds. CT complexes between the donor piroxicam and 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) and chloranilic acid (ChA) as electron acceptors have been studied and characterized both experimentally and theoretically. Herewith we aimed to determine the stability of the expected structure of the formed piroxicam complexes for the first time. Several analytical tools (FTIR, NMR, mass spectrometry, UV-Visible spectroscopy and conductometric analysis) were applied to characterize these complexes. The stoichiometry of the examined complexes was assessed using Job's method and Benesi-Hildebrand equation, and a molar ratio of 1:1 between the donor and acceptors were resulted from these complexes. The physical parameters of the formed CT-complexes were determined by calculations of formation constant, molar absorptivity, oscillator strength, dipole moment, ionization potential, CT energy, resonance energy, dissociation energy, and standard free energy of complexation. In addition, the UV-Vis spectra and CT transition properties of these complexes were computationally determined with DFT and TD-DFT methods. The results confirmed that these complexes are CT complexes. The current study shows that the complexes formed are stable and can be used for the determination of piroxicam in pharmaceutical form."
665,Autogenous shrinkage of high-performance cement-based carbon nanofiber composites,2019-06-01,"Low water–cement ratio (W/C) and high-strength concrete have been widely used, and cracks caused by the early autogenous shrinkage of concrete have become increasingly prominent. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) have been added to cement-based materials to help enhance autogenous shrinkage and reduce early cracks. In this study, uniformly dispersed CNFs were added into high-performance cementitious composites. The autogenous shrinkage of high-performance cementitious composites incorporated with CNFs at varying amounts was also investigated; the W/C ratios were 0.25, 0.30, and 0.35. The microscopic mechanism of autogenous shrinkage was also determined based on heat of hydration, hydration products, microstructure, and porosity of cementitious CNF composites. Adding appropriate amounts of CNF decreased the autogenous shrinkage of cementitious composites. When 0.12 wt% CNF cement paste was incorporated into the sample, the reduced ratio of autogenous shrinkage (reaching 98.73%) relative to that of the blank sample, as well as the autogenous shrinkage, was minimal with the W/C equal to 0.35 after treatment for 7 days."
666,Numerical verification of absorption enhancement based on metal array embedded metamaterials,2019-06-01,"In this paper, a single-band metamaterial absorber is designed and numerically verified with a metal particles array embedded in a dielectric layer. A highly absorbance peak (73%, R = 70 nm) is achieved around 520 nm, which originates from the resonance of local surface plasmon (LSP) mode on the metal particles and surface plasmon (SP) mode of the metal substrate. Further simulation results show that the absorption peak can be enhanced to 95% with the diameter of the metal particle increasing. To reveal the effect of the metal substrate on the absorbance property, a metamaterial absorber without metal substrate is further calculated and compared. The factor δ = |EP  1|MAX/|EP  2|MAX is applied to reveal the electric field enhancement performance. The feasibility of the proposed metamaterial equipment applying for sensing the change of the environmental media is numerically verified."
667, microscopic observations of dynamic viscoelastic contact and deformation at a friction interface,2019-06-01,"In this paper, based on the real-time in-situ observation, aims to explore the effect of viscoelastic properties on the actual contact and friction. The dynamic viscoelastic contact characteristics and microscopic friction wear mechanisms for three linings were compared. The results show that the actual contact area increases linearly with the loss factor and the stick-slip displacement increases with the loss modulus. The friction coefficient of the GM-3 lining stabilized after approximately 1000 seconds and entered the stable friction stage. The actual contact area and friction coefficient of the G30 and K25 linings slowly increased and remained in the running-in friction stage. The best viscoelastic lining is more suitable for severe working conditions. The obtained results play an important theoretical role in enriching the friction transmission mechanism of the flexible body and have an important reference value for flexible body friction transmissions such as large high-speed elevators and belt conveyors."
668,"Synthesis, characterization and corrosion resistance properties of Ormosil-modified polyurethane (PU/Ormosil) composites",2019-06-01,"Composite films with polyurethane/organically-modified silicates (PU/Ormosil) were synthesized through a sol–gel and copolymerization technique. Isophoron diisocyanate (IPDI), Hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) and Ormosil were used as precursors for the composite films. The composites were deposited via spin-coating onto aluminum alloy and steel for improve protection against corrosion. The effects of Ormosil content on the structural, thermal properties and corrosion resistance of the composites were investigated. The structures of the composites were characterized using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The GPC, FTIR and SEM spectra suggested successful bonding of Ormosil silanols and PU resin. The thermal properties of the PU/Ormosil composites were improved in comparison with pure PU according to thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Potentio-dynamic and salt-spray analyses revealed that the PU/Ormosil composite films provided an exceptional barrier and corrosion protection in comparison with PU and untreated aluminum alloy and steel."
669,Effect of temperature and rolling rate on high chromium cast iron/low carbon steel composite plate prepared by hot rolling,2019-06-01,"This study aimed to develop a process for preparing high-chromium cast iron (HCCI)/low-carbon steel (LCS) wear-resistant composite panels by hot rolled symmetrical billet. Hot rolling experiments were conducted at 1000, 1100, and 1200 °C with rolling rates of 0.5, 0.75, and 1 s–1 and 60% rolling reduction. The effects of hot rolling parameters on the microstructure and mechanical properties of composite interface and HCCI layer were studied. Results showed that the composite plate can achieve hot rolling deformation with no crack at a large rolling reduction due to the stress release effect of the softer LCS. A higher rolling temperature (1200 °C) and a lower rolling speed (0.17 r/s) facilitated the metallurgical bonding of HCCI/LCS. The diffusion width of Cr between the interface and the interfacial shear strength increase with the increase in temperature and decrease in rolling rate. An increase in the rolling temperature caused a significant refinement of the HCCI carbide and an increase in the volume fraction of the carbide. As the rolling temperature increases, the overall hardness of the HCCI layer decreases because of an increase in retained austenite in the metal matrix, but the wear resistance is improved."
670,Influence of boron nitride nanoparticles in the electrical and photoconduction characteristics of planar boron nitride-graphene oxide composite layer,2019-06-01,"A modified Hummer's method is used to obtain a photoconducting material based on boron nitride (BN)–graphene oxide (GO) composite layer. The proposed silver/BN–GO/silver Schottky photodetector was fabricated using a drop-casting technique and electron beam evaporation. It was characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The confine element composition of boron, nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen showed excellent photoconduction toward laser wavelength of 650 nm and output power of 0.7 mW. The dark and illuminated current–voltage characteristics were used to determine the ideality factor and barrier height, which inevitably simplified the transport mechanism in the device. The reported ideality factor of 2.58 suggests the charge transport at the junction and formation of non-amorphous BN–GO composite layer."
671,"A tight-binding analysis of models, sheet width, and strain for 2D monoatomic germanium sheets",2019-06-01,"2D Germanium (Ge) has attracted significant research interest in the short time it was first synthesized and reported. There currently exist significant disagreements on the exact electronic structure of these novel 2D materials between theoretical calculations and experiment, particularly in terms of both the nature and value of the bandgap. In this work we report on a detailed tight-binding (TB) analysis of the electronic structure of Hydrogen (H) passivated 2D monoatomic Ge sheets (Germanene). We also explore different sets of nearest tight-binding (TB) parameters—sp 3 and sp 3 d 5 s*. Spin-orbit coupling is included in the calculations, and the effects of same-atom off-diagonal parameters are explored. Using the models, we also explore the effects of sheet-width (pseudo 1D structures or nanoribbons), axis orientation, and uniaxial strain. The physical structures for the unit-cells for the nanoribbons are determined after full-geometry optimization in the DFT package Gaussian. Therefore, our TB models account for the deviation from the idealized structures because of deformation perpendicular to the axis of these structures. All TB models are able to match the nature of the experimentally reported bandgap, while the more detailed sp 3 d 5 s* TB model provides a relatively close match with the experimentally reported bandgap value. We also propose a small modification of the existing Ge–H TB parameters to improve the accuracy of the bandgap value match."
672,Catalytic Synthesis of High Aspect Ratio AlO Impregnated Carbon Nanotubes Used to Improve Thermophysical Properties of Nanofluids with A Case Study on an Industrial Gasoline-water Heat Exchanger,2019-04-01,"Thermophysical properties of nanofluids containing multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are highly dependent on the surface morphology of the MWCNTs. In this study, a vertical-injection reactor was used to produce Al2O3-impregnated MWCNTs by free substrate catalytic cracking in the presence of aluminum isopropoxide. The synthesized MWCNTs were characterized by BET SEM, TEM, XRD, and TGA. The Al2O3 nanoparticles act as nano-spacers, reducing the entanglement of MWCNTs, thereby increasing the aspect ratio to 5500. These MWCNTs were used to prepare nanofluids with low concentrations (NF0.1, NF0.3, and NF0.5 wt%) in water. Thermophysical properties of the nanofluids were determined under static lab conditions. Values of the thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and viscosity increase with increasing concentration of MWCNTs. The thermophysical properties were further used to calculate the heat transfer rate (q) and the pressure drop (ΔP) in a full-scale gasoline-water shell and tube heat exchanger used in the petrochemical industry. When NF0.1 is used in the heat exchanger, q increases by 34% with a ΔP penalty of 5%. A comparison of Nu, Pr, and Re of water with those of the nanofluids under given industrial flow conditions, indicates that the effects due to the viscosity of the nanofluids significantly influence the heat transfer mode distribution."
673,Stress and Temperature Distribution Simulation For Arc Weld-based Rapid Prototyping Of Titanium Alloy Tc4,2019-04-01,"Weld-based rapid prototyping is an inexpensive manufacturing technology, which is being developed based on the layered manufacturing technique to shape metal parts along predefined paths. Temperature and its induced stresses usually decide the properties of deposited metals. In this paper, the thermal and stress distributions in a single-pass, multi-layer weld-based rapid prototyping of titanium alloy TC4 were examined by numerical simulation. The results showed that the peak values of the temperature for a single thermal cycle in a deposited layer, gradually decreased with the increase in the number of deposited layers. The accumulation of heat was identified from the comparative analysis of peak values of temperature for different deposited layers in the same thermal cycle. The peak temperature of the layers deposited at the last, increased initially, which then stabilized due to the accumulation of heat from the earlier deposited layers. Preheating treatment effectively reduced the internal stress of the deposited part thereby making the stress distribution uniform. It was observed that the rear layer had a re-melting or post-heating effect on the front layer, relaxing the stress of the stacking part to a certain extent."
674,Ultrathin Porous Interconnected Carbon Nanosheets Derived from Sisal Fibers For Efficient Li-ion Battery Anodes,2019-04-01,"Ultrathin porous interconnected carbon nanosheets (UPICNs) were successfully prepared from sisal fibers via a combination of hydrothermal and activation processes. The structures of the UPICNs can be controlled by adjusting the weight ratio of alkali to sisal cellfibers. The UPICNs were made up of ultrathin (2 nm) interconnected carbon nanosheets with relatively high crystalline degree and an open meso-microporous surface area of 822.14 m2 g–1 at the optimal ratio of 2.5. The UPICNs electrode demonstrates excellent cycling performance, superior rate capability, and high reversible capacity when used as a lithium ion battery anode material. A reversible capacity of 685 mA h g–1 is maintained after 50 cycles at the current density of 0.05 A g–1. Even at a high current density of 2 A g–1, the reversible capacity was still retained at 279 mA h g–1 for over 1,000 cycles, rendering a nearly 100% corresponding coulombic efficiency."
675,Role of Shell Thickness and Applied Field on The Magnetic Anisotropy and Temperature Dependence of Coercivity in FeO /γ-FeO Core/shell Nanoparticles,2019-04-01,"We report on the effect of shell thickness and the magnetic field on the effective magnetic anisotropy, K eff and on the temperature dependence of coercivity, H C (T) in Fe3O4/γ-Fe2O3 core/shell nanoparticles of fixed diameter (8 nm) and several shell thicknesses (1, 3 and 5 nm). The particles are synthesized by the usual co-precipitation method. The phase and the morphology of the sample are characterized by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The morphology of the nanoparticles is confirmed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The magnetic measurements are carried out using a SQUID in the temperature range of 2 K to 300 K both under zero field-cooling (ZFC) and fieldcooling (FC) protocols with field-cooling values, H FC of 0.5 T, 1 T, 2 T and 3 T. H C(T) in the samples is found to significantly deviate from the original Kneller's law. These deviations are attributed to modifications of the interfacial magnetic anisotropy that resulted from variations in the interfacial spin-glass regions with shell thickness and field-cooling. K eff is calculated using two methods based on the magnetization measurements. In the first method we used the H C(T) curves obtained from the ZFC and FC magnetization versus magnetic field M–H hysteresis loops. In the second method the ZFC magnetization versus temperature (M–T) measurements are used at several applied magnetic fields. We compared and discussed the different results of K eff obtained by these two methods."
676,Tio Nanoparticle Modified -FeO Nanospindles For Improved Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation,2019-04-01,"Surface modification is an effective way to improve the photoelectrochemical water splitting efficiency of Fe2O3 photoanode. Here, TiO2 nanoparticles were used to decorate on the surface of Fe2O3 spindles and formed Fe2O3/TiO2 core–shell nanostructures. After modification, small amount of Fe3+ doped into TiO2, creating oxygen vacancies at the interfaces of Fe2O3/TiO2 as confirmed by means of XRD, UV-vis, XPS and EPR. The TiO2 compact shells are composed of uniform nanoparticles with a size of 5–20 nm. Compared with pure Fe2O3, the Fe2O3/TiO2 displays enhanced photocatalytic activity for photoelectrochemical water splitting under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm). The photocurrent density of Fe2O3/TiO2 photoanodes was equal to 0.23 mA/cm 2 at 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), which is about 1.5 times as high as that of pristine Fe2O3. The high performances of the Fe2O3/TiO2 photoanode can be attributed to the better separation of electrons and holes caused by surface oxygen vacancies. The photocurrent densities under visible-light illumination of Fe2O3/TiO2 was further improved after high-temperature calcination owing to the increase of oxygen vacancies of the sample. This work may provide more insights to design new-type and efficient photoanodes for PEC applications."
677,Fabrication and Characterization of Surfaceenhanced Raman Scattering Substrates With Ordered Arrays of Gold Nanopyramids By Means of Nanosphere Lithography,2019-04-01,"In this work we combine the techniques of nanosphere lithography (NSL) and thermal evaporative patterning to fabricate gold nanostructures that can be used as substrates for Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS). Spherical submicrometer-sized silica particles were prepared according to the sol–gel method and deposited as a monolayer onto silicon and silica plates, in order to use it as a mask to create regular arrays of triangle-based Au nanopyramids after a 50 nm thick Au film thermal evaporation. Rhodamine 6G, a dye molecule, was chosen as the SERS probe molecule to determine the enhancement factor of the Raman signal intensity. We studied the SERS performance of the system consisting of the Au nanopyramid arrays in comparison with a pure Au thin film evaporated onto a Si substrate, previously dipped in R6G in the same conditions. The results indicate that the sensing capabilities of the nanostructured sample are several orders of magnitude higher when compared with those exhibited by the gold thin films. Indeed, a SERS enhancement factor as large as approximately 1 × 106 can be achieved for the 1650 cm–1 Raman signal obtained with different excitation laser wavelengths (532 and 780 nm). Therefore, we can conclude that these combined techniques allow the fabrication of highly reproducible and ultrasensitive detecting SERS substrates."
678,Fabrication of Low-density Heat-Resistance Polystyrene/Carbon Black Composite Microspheres Used as Hydraulic Fracturing Proppant,2019-04-01,"A series of polystyrene/carbon black composite microspheres as oil fracturing low-density proppant have been successfully synthesized via one-step technique of suspension polymerization. The apparent density of the microspheres was around 1.025–1.077 g/cm3 which favored the hydraulic transportation in oil drilling; the thermal stability of the proppants was improved remarkably. The oil permeation performance of low density proppants with optimum addition of CB was superior to commercial available products. Hence, PS/CB composite microspheres serving as the newly developed low-cost and low-density proppant would have a good prospect in the field of oil exploitation."
679,Influence of Aging Time and Medium on Enclosed Mold Shear Bond Strength on Titanium,2019-04-01,"The present research was aimed to assess the enclosed mold shear bond strength (EM-SBS) and investigate the effect of different storage conditions on composite cement to titanium (Ti) adhesion using an experimental primer. Twelve planar Ti specimens were prepared, grit-blasted and silica-coated with Rocatec Soft, and randomly assigned to 2 groups i.e., control treated with ESPE Sil while the experimental group was treated 3-acryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (1.0% v/v) and bis-1,2-(triethoxysilyl)ethane (0.5% v/v) based primer. Composite cement was used to build resin stubs on each Ti specimen. Ti specimens were subjected to artificial aging: in a desiccator (24 h), water aging for 2 and 4 months (37 °C ± 3 °C), immersed in artificial saliva for 2 and 4 months (26 °C ± 3 °C), and thermo-cycled for 12,000 cycles. Specimens were characterized for elemental and contact angle analysis. Shear bond adhesion strength was performed using a universal mechanical tester and failure modes were analyzed visually with a light stereomicroscope. The experimental data was handled using SPSS (Version 21, Chicago, IL, USA). The data were analyzed statistically using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, p = 0.05) followed by Tukey's post hoc analysis. The chemical analysis revealed roughly the same wt-% of [Si] content in both groups. The contact angles were in the range of 16–37° in both control and experimental groups. The experimental group showed statistically higher EM-SBS (10.8 MPa ± 3.4 MPa) following 12,000 thermo-cycles (p < 0.05). On the effect of aging by distilled water and artificial saliva, the mean EM-SBS of the experimental group was remarkably higher compared to the control. The predominant failure type in control group was adhesive in nature. However, mixed failure mode was observed in most of the storage media experimental groups. The use of experimental silane primer likely to enhance the hydrophilicity of the Ti surfaces. In addition, a signi?cant increase in the EM-SBS between resin composite cement and silica-coated Ti was observed without being much affected in aging conditions."

In this work, TiN thin films are deposited by using RF magnetron sputtering (reactive sputtering type) with a pure titanium target, argon (Ar), and nitrogen (N2) gases. All sputtered TiN thin films were subsequently annealed in air at 800 C for 2 hours. The microstructure and the optical properties (absorbance and emittance) of sputtered TiN thin films are studied before and after annealing. The optical properties of all thin films before and after annealing are characterized by spectrophotometer, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The morphology and structure are studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM), atomic force microscope (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy. It was found that the optical absorbance of sputtered TiN thin films is changed after annealing and increased to 94% with a stable profile in ultraviolet (UV), visible range and near infrared (IR) ranges. The initial polycrystalline TiN microstructure is transformed after annealing in air at 800 °C for 2 hours to rutile TiO2 nanofibers. These nanofibers caused light scattering inside the thin film, which improved the optical absorbance."
684,Synergistic inhibition behavior of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate and sodium acetate for AZ31B magnesium alloy in NaCl solution,2019-02-01,"The inhibition effect of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (SDDTC) and sodium acetate (NaAc) as green ecofriendly corrosion inhibitor for magnesium (Mg) alloy AZ31B (3wt% aluminum and 1wt% zinc) in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution was investigated by electrochemical measurements, weight loss measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Results reveal that the combined addition of SDDTC or NaAc can synergistically inhibit the corrosion of Mg alloy AZ31B and an optimal inhibition efficiency in terms of corrosion of AZ31B substrate was yielded in 3.5 wt% NaCl electrolyte containing 0.3 × 10–3 mol L–1 SDDTC and 0.15 mol L–1 NaAc. Surface analysis results suggest the corrosion inhibition ability of SDDTC and NaAc in the naturally corrosion system could be attributed to the formation of a compact protective film. The corrosion inhibition efficiency of the combined addition was predominantly because of SDDTC would chelate with Mg via their N atoms to form the SDDTC-Mg and NaAc-Mg complexes deposits at the active electrochemical corrosion sites to reduces the porosity of the original Mg(OH)2 surface film and inhibits the anodic dissolution of AZ31B alloy."
685,Preparation and properties of alkyl benzene sulfonic acid coated boehmite/chitosan nanocomposite membranes with enhanced proton conductivity for proton exchange membrane fuel cells,2019-02-01,"In this study, alkyl benzene sulfonic acid coated boehmite nanofillers (OS2) were incorporated into chitosan (CS) to prepare novel CS/OS2 nanocomposite membranes for proton exchange membrane fuel cell applications, and then their microstructure and physicochemical properties were characterized. These nanocomposite membranes show high proton conductivity, good thermal stability, and improved mechanical characteristics. The electrostatic interactions between –SO3H groups of boehmite nanofillers and amine groups of CS can inhibit the mobility of CS chains, resulting in a decrease in the swelling area of the nanocomposite membrane in water and thus an increase in its dimensional stability. The development of acid–base pairs at the nanofiller interface facilitates the formation of consecutive transfer pathways to improve the proton conductivity of synthesized membranes. The maximum proton conductivity (0.033 S · cm–1) is obtained in the CS/OS2-5 nanocomposite membrane, which is equal to that of commercial Nafion 117. The eco-friendly and cost-effective nature of CS-based membrane makes it as a promising candidate for proton exchange membrane fuel cell applications."

Mater. Chem. A (2014) 2:6296–6300). In this work, the mesoporous SiC prepared via a one-step nanocasting process has been adopted to replace the commercial micro-SiC, to improve the weak light absorption of SiC which suppresses the photocatalytic activity in previous literature. It has been demonstrated that the mesoporous SiC/CdS composite with suitable coverage ratio of SiC (with the molar ratio of SiC:CdS as 1:1) shows stronger light absorption and enhanced charge transfer rate. In consequence, the hydrogen evolution rate reaches 952 μmol · h–1· g–1 in the absence of noble metal co-catalyst, which is two times of the micro SiC/CdS system. Our work provides an effective route to enhance the photocatalysis in SiC-based heterojunction materials. This strategy can also be extended in other Z-scheme photocatalytic systems."

A sub-micron powder mixture of Alumina-Titania in a ratio of 1:2 was used as reinforcement. Both in-situ and ex-situ processing including reaction wetting by Titania, were used. To refine the structure and minimize porosity, the alloy-particle slurry was forged at pressures from 0 to 220 N/mm2, followed by T61 ppt.-hardening to achieve peak hardness. Composites characterized by microstructure, hardness, density, porosity, SEM, and EDS at different forging pressures displayed substantial refinement of structure and almost eliminating porosity at high forging pressure level. Tribological performance of the composites marked significant improvement at high forging pressure. SEM micrographs were analyzed to identify the wear-regime and wear mechanisms. The friction coefficient was reduced slightly with the load at high forging pressure. Based on experimental results, a linear mathematical relationship between the forging pressure, the normal bearing load and the wear rate of hybrid composites is suggested. Relationships between the other process parameters and properties have also been developed. The density, porosity, particle retention and Fe content on worn surface vary with forging pressure following polynomial equations. The temperature of counterface follows logarithmic variation with the forging pressure."

Depending on the direction of the applied field the mid-gap states could possess the localized or metallic nature i.e., non-zero midgap density of states. Adjustability of the bandgap and optical dipole transition matrix elements are explained based on the symmetry of involved band edge states. This promises new electronic and optical devices based on phosphorene nanoribbons."
693,Characteristics and wear performance of borided AISI 440C matensitic stainless steel,2018-12-01,"In this study, some mechanical properties and diffusion kinetics of boride layer on AISI 440C matensitic stainless steel were investigated. Boriding treatment was conducted at temperatures of 1123, 1173, 1223 and 1323 K for 2, 4, 6 and 8 h by pack method. The boride layers were characterised by optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), micro-Vickers hardness tester and Daimler-Benz Rockwell-C adhesion test.

We find that U atom is most likely to stay on the hollow site of perfect graphene. The energy barrier for migrating a U atom from one hollow site to another hollow site is 454 meV, which indicates the adsorption is stable at room temperature. Moreover, U atom on defective graphene sheet is much more stable than that on pure graphene due to the formation of strong chemical bond. The adsorption energy is as large as 5.08∼9.37 eV. We also find that all adsorption systems are spin-polarized and their corresponding magnetic moment are in the range of 1.53∼5.07μB . The strong adsorption and large magnetic moments endow these systems with potential applications in the collection for U atoms, spintronic devices and catalytic materials."
696,Tensile fracture characteristics of forged and aged Mg enriched-2218 alloy based hybrid metal matrix composites,2018-12-01,"A combined casting-forging approach was employed to develop hybrid metal matrix composites using Mg-enriched 2218 as matrix and multiple reinforcements of Al2O3 and TiO2 particles. The forging pressure was varied from 0 to 200 MPa. The composites were given T6 thermal treatment. The composites were tested for tensile properties at elevated temperatures up to 400 °C and fracture behavior was characterized based on forging pressure, reinforced particles, dimple size and their number in coherence with the microstructures. The pressure applied during forging had a positive effect on the porosity, alloy-particle bonding, interfacial strength and segregation of the solutes, resisting the interdendritic cracking. The reinforcement restricted void growth. The transition of fracture mode from semi-ductile to ductile was observed as the test temperature was increased and from ductile to brittle when the forging pressure was increased."

The composite powders with fine size and homogenously distributed phases exhibit strawberry-like morphology where scattered W nanoparticles stuck to the surface of Cu particles. Regardless of the low content of Cu, the as-synthesized powders could be rapidly densified at solid state by using the field assisted sintering technique (FAST), which was benefited from the high sinterability of the initial powders prepared by co-precipitation and the unique sintering mechanism of FAST, i.e., the combination of mechanical, thermal and current effects on the sintering process. Both sintering temperature and pressure show significant influence on the relative density and elemental distribution of the final W–Cu composites. A maximum relative density of 96.7% was achieved from the samples sintered at 970 °C under 120 MPa in which W and Cu are uniformly distributed. Correspondingly, the composites show excellent thermal conductivity and low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), making them candidate materials for high density electronic packaging."
699,Bromine aqueous electrolyte redox capacitor using carbon nanotubes,2018-12-01,"An electrolyte redox electrochemical capacitor (EREC) using the redox reaction of bromide ions in singlewalled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was demonstrated. The maximum cell voltage of Br EREC increased up to about 1.5 V without oxygen evolution. The energy density of EREC was greatly improved by using the redox reaction of bromide ions instead of iodide ions used in a previous work. It was found by monitoring the capacitance retention that SWCNT electrode can firmly hold the inserted Br molecules. We also investigated the structure and insertion site of the Br molecules inserted in SWCNTs by Raman and XRD measurements. Raman measurements revealed the existence of (Br2) n  chain-like molecules and Br– 3 ions. Br molecules are likely to occupy the triangular lattice space of SWCNT bundles, because the diffraction lines of SWCNT bundle structure disappeared after Br insertion."
700,Luminescence quenching of fire retardant silica based chromophores,2018-12-01,"Nano silicon dioxide (SiO2) is one of the potential materials for fire retardancy. The chromophores extracted from silica spheres having emission maximum at 435 nm and 530 nm show the luminescence quenching by concentration due to the low excitation rate and no luminescence quenching by concentration due to the very large excitation rate, respectively. The formation of photoluminescent chromophores is strongly dependent on the combination of solvents. The diameters of silica spheres synthesized with 1:1 wt. ratio and 15:1 ratio of acetone and ammonium hydroxide were uniform and diverse, respectively. Although the luminescent chromophores were formed after 40 days for silica spheres synthesized with 15:1 ratio of acetone and NH4OH, the chromophores were not formed for fire retardant silica spheres synthesized with 1:1 ratio of acetone and NH4OH. The high resolution transmission electron microscope image shows the well-organized one directional crystal structures of the chromophores."

704,Fullerene derivatives: A review on perovskite solar cells,2018-10-01,"Perovskite is considered to be one of the highly efficient materials in the area of photovoltaics which rapidly increased in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8 to over 22%. But the major drawback of perovskite solar cell (PSC) is its stability, hysteretic current–voltage behaviour and high temperature requirement during production. Researchers are paying attention towards the development of new method to overcome these drawbacks, out of which one of the method is perovskite/fullerene based hybrid solar cell. Fullerenes play a vital role in the organic photovoltaics (OPV) to improve the photovoltaic properties. In the recent years perovskite/fullerene based hybrid solar cell grabbed the attention, particularly owing to its high performance capability in solar cells at low temperature which can be used on flexible substrates. In this review, we have summarized most of the research work on fullerene based perovskite solar cells that have been published so far, we have also discussed how fullerenes reduce current hysteresis, improved stability and the benefits of using fullerene and its derivatives which help in increasing the efficiency of perovskite solar cells."
705,"Effect of graphene nanoplatelets on the properties, pore structure and microstructure of cement composites",2018-10-01,"Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) with extraordinary mechanical properties have been extensively applied in various fields as reinforcing materials. However, the mechanism of the GNPs reinforcing effect on cement composites is still under debate. In this research, the GNPs were dispersed in mixing water by means of dispersant combining with ultrasonication. The GNPs cement composites with different GNPs contents were prepared and their mechanical performance were investigated. In addition, the effects of GNPs on the hydration products of cement-based materials were studied by using different analytical techniques. Meanwhile, the pore structure and microstructure of GNP/cement composites were observed with the help of Mercury intrusion porosimeter (MIP) and Scanning electron microscope (SEM/EDS). It is found that the addition of 0.05 wt% GNPs increase the compressive and flexural strengths by about 4.3%, 3.7% and 27.4%, 25.2% in 7 d and 28 d curing ages, respectively. The experimental results suggest that GNPs may contribute to promoting the crystalline of calcium hydroxide (CH) and the formation of silica tetrahedron in calcium silicate hydrate gels (C–S–H) at the early age. The cement composites exhibit a more compact and optimal pore structure through refining pore size and reducing total porosity. And GNPs can enhance cement composites in mechanisms of filling effect, pull-out effect, branching and deflection of cracks."

707,Investigation of structural and tribological properties of layers formed in SAE 5140 steel coated with boride powders,2018-10-01,"In this study, the surface of SAE 5140 steel was coated with ferroboron using new powder boriding agent (Baybora-1) for various boriding time at 950 °C. The chemical composition and morphology of the phases formed in the internal structure of the borided samples were examined by XRD, optical microscope and SEM, respectively. In addition, the mechanical properties of the boride layers formed were determined by the measurements of the subsurface hardness. In order to determine the tribological behaviour, these samples were subjected to wear testing using alumina ceramic abrasive powder at different loads. It was observed that the internal structure of unborided samples is generally formed by ferrite and pearlite phases. It has been determined that the boride layer having two different chemical compositions is formed as a result of the boriding processes made for different periods and the boride layer thickness increases with increasing boriding time. Sub-surface hardness measurements showed that three different zones were formed under the surface. In addition, the average surface hardness value of the SEA 5140 steel is 367 ± 8.2 HV0.1, while it increased up to 1997 ± 17.2 HV0.1 as the result of the boriding. As a result of the wear testing carried out, it was observed that the abrasion was very dependent on the phases formed in the boride layer and the most suitable boriding time was determined. It has been determined that all borided samples increase the abrasion resistance of the raw steel by about 4 times."

However, it has hardly been studied yet, especially the study of nano-indentation in (011) and (111) crystal interphase interfaces. Thus, the nano-indentation of Ni-based single crystal alloy is simulated under various interphase interfaces in this paper. Results show that the crystal hardness, energy, interfacial dislocation networks and their movement features have a great difference under different interphase interfaces, which exhibit obvious anisotropy. The mechanical properties of (111) phase interface model are obviously stronger than those of (001) and (011), and the mechanical properties of (001) phase interface is the worst one. This study has an important guiding significance for making full use of the anisotropy of Ni-based single crystal alloy to manufacture high-performance turbine blades."

Therefore, a basic understanding of these properties is essential for applications in spintronics devices, especially as the film thickness is reduced. In this work, the transport and magnetic properties of stoichiometric ultrathin epitaxial Fe3O4 films have been investigated. The Fe3O4 films were grown on MgO (001) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy under optimal growth conditions. Low energy electron diffraction and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy confirmed that the films are single phase Fe3O4. The Verwey transition has been investigated using both transport and magnetization measurements. The magnetization measurements show a sharp Verwey transition in all of these films, which indicates that the films have properties comparable to the bulk. Furthermore, the magnetization measurements at room temperature show that the ultrathin films with thickness t < 20 nm are ferromagnetic with magnetization values greater than those for bulk magnetite. Such enhanced magnetization in ultrathin Fe3O4 films is very promising for spin injection and other applications."
710,Effect of pH and leaf extract concentration of on gold nanoparticles synthesis,2018-10-01,"In this work a methodology to produce high quality gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) from an aqueous extract of Pittosporum undulatum leaves, as reducing and capping agent, is presented. The gold nanoparticles obtained were characterized by UV-Vis, XRD, FTIR spectroscopy and TEM. The AuNPs synthesis produced a color change of the reaction mixture from light yellow to dark purple and the absorption spectrum presented a maximal peak at about 530 nm, corresponding to surface resonance plasmon (SPR) band, typical of the AuNPs formation. The effect of pH on AuNPs biosynthesis was determined and TEM analysis revealed that at pH 12 the AuNPs obtained presented mostly spheroidal geometry and a size range from 3 to 10 nm, with an average size of 6.3 nm in diameter. Through X-ray diffraction studies a crystallite size of 6.08 nm was obtained, indicating that nature of AuNPs was essentially monocrystalline. Finally, FTIR spectroscopy analysis revealed that compounds such as alcohols, terpenes, and sterols present in the leaves extract could be involved on the reduction of Au+3 and subsequent stabilization of nanoparticles. Therefore, using this methodology, it will be possible to obtain gold nanoparticles of small size and uniform geometry, which could be used in specific medical applications."
711,Effect of iron impurity in liquid phase exfoliated tungsten disulfide based ultraviolet heterojunction photodetector,2018-10-01,"Photoconductivity characteristics of iron (Fe) impurity in a tungsten disulfide (WS2) based ultraviolet (UV) heterojunction photodetector are studied and presented in this work. Fe impurities through electrolysis process during current–voltage (I–V) characterization is found in the WS2 sample by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. Unexpectedly, this Fe impurity enhances the performance of the WS2 based UV heterojunction photodetector due to the increase of the electron concentration in the WS2 structural matrix. Photon responsivity is observed to increase by 231% while the dark current reduces by 80% as compared to pure WS2 samples. The highest responsivity achieved is 5.9 AW–1 when the input optical power is 7.8 μW at 382 nm with a bias voltage of 10 V and a dark current as low as 6 μA. The enhancement due to the Fe impurities will encourage additional studies into the doping and hybridization of metals into two dimensional (2D) materials for better photodetector performance."

With microwave heating, the synthesis time can be shortened to 12 min, which is much shorter than the time required by conventional method (10 days, 150 °C). The study reveals that the use of basic synthesis condition and K+ as the cation source are essential in order to produce zeolite W nanocrystals. The K-W displays bundle-like nanorods morphology with highly accessible hierarchical mesoporosity.

However, their perspectives are primarily impeded by the material instability arising from the labile surface and ionic nature of CsPbBr3 NCs. Hence it is high desired to obtain robust CsPbBr3 NCs film for practical applications. Herein, we deposited Al2O3 on NCs film surface for film stabilization by plasmaenhanced atomic layer deposition. The dense Al2O3 film can yield an excellent encapsulation effect, leading to a dramatically improved stability of CsPbBr3 NCs film.

714,"Fabrication of microelectrode ensembles on thin-film single electrodes: The degradation of electropolymerized benzene-1,3-diol films in caustic solutions",2018-08-01,"This paper explores the degradation of poly benzene-1,3-diol films in caustic solutions. A polymer film was deposited on Micrux® thin film gold electrodes (A = 0.008 cm2) or gold-coated silicon wafer chips (A = 1.0 cm2). The deposition parameters, exposure time and the concentrations of caustic solutions were optimized to obtain the efficient microelectrode ensembles. The electrochemical behavior of the deposited material was studied by cyclic voltammetry. The final morphology of the films was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Through exposure to caustic solutions, polymer removal from the electrode surfaces resulted in the creation of a microelectrode ensemble. The voids on the surfaces were filled successfully with polyaniline by electropolymerization process. TEM and AFM analyses revealed the existence of polyaniline spherical nanoparticles in the modified films with a diameter slightly above 50 nm. The calculated average inter-pore distance using SEM micrographs was approximately 543 nm for the Micrux® electrode, and approximately 860 nm for gold-coated Si-chips. The number density of the pores was equal to 4.9 × 108 electrodes/cm2 for Micrux® modified electrode, while 2.0 × 108 electrodes/cm2 for gold-coated Si-chips. The present work allows the production of high-density microelectrode ensembles using a cost-effective route, and a platform for a wide range of applications including sensor technology."
715,Porous supraparticles of LiFePO nanorods with carbon for high rate Li-ion batteries,2018-08-01,"Porous supraparticles, or spherical aggregate of LiFePO4 with carbon were prepared by spray-drying of LiFePO4 nanorods and glucose by heat treatment. Rod-like LiFePO4 nanoparticles are prepared by a solvothermal process, which was then sprayed with glucose as a carbon source forming spherical particles of LiFePO4 nanoparticles and glucose. Through the heat treatment under a nitrogen atmosphere, glucose was carbonized inside LiFePO4 supraparticles. Due to the interstices between nanoparticles, the spherical aggregates showed fairly high specific surface area (35.0104 m2g–1). Supraparticles-based electrode exhibited high initial capacity as well as remarkably high rate capability; discharging capacity was 146.15 mAhg–1 at high 10 C (1602.5 mA/g) and 126.58 mAhg–1 at 50 C (8012.5 mA/g). Moreover, cyclic performance at 5 C (801.25 mA/g) was relatively high as well (99% retention after 100 times test). Our porous carbonized LiFePO4 supraparticles have higher packing density or tap density (1.07 g/cm3) than carbonized LiFePO4 nanoparticle (0.78 g/cm3), which is considered an important factor in the practical application."
716,Performance of a new coal-dust-based composite sealing material for gas-drainage borehole,2018-08-01,"Traditional sealing materials for gas-drainage boreholes are characterized by poor stability, low permeability, and low adaptability. This study aimed to solve these shortcomings by developing a new coal-dust-based (CD) composite sealing material, in which coal dust was used as base material and was supplemented by amino resin as the binder, and also added several other additions. Through the research of the properties of the CD sealing material, the results show that this material has a favorable liquidity with the material-water ratio of 1:1.1∼1:1.5, the material shows the best mechanical property when the coal-dust/resin ratio is 1.0, and the expansion rate can reach up to 11.43%, which indicate that the CD sealing material can satisfy the technical requirements on sealing technology. Moreover, the sealing simulation experiments were also performed to evaluate the sealing effect of this developed material and the traditional sealing materials, the results indicate that the CD sealing material can diffuse sufficiently around borehole to form a larger grouting range, with maximum penetration radius of 36 mm. The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) results also reveal that the CD sealing material can penetrate into microfractures with 10 μm aperture and combine closely with coal mass. And the Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results also reveal that some physical or chemical reactions were happened between resin molecules and coal-dust to form a firm coating. Compared with the traditional sealing materials, the CD sealing material has a superior sealing performance."
717,"Chemical reactivity, molecular structure, spectroscopic and DFT computational studies of spiro-heterocycle incorporating furan ring",2018-08-01,"Spiro-heterocycle derivative was prepared by reaction of dienone derivative with active methylene heterocycle pyrimdine-trione derivative in DCM mediated by diethyl amine as base. The X-ray structure of the dienone and target compound were determined and the chemical reactivity of the reactants were investigated using DFT B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) calculations. The reaction could proceed only in the presence of diethylamine as base. In addition, the molecular structure and physico-properties of the desired target were computed and the calculated structure agreed well with the experimental data. The atomic charges and the stabilization energy due to the intramolecular charge delocalization processes were calculated using NBO method. The small LP(2)O4→ BD*(1)C22–H38 (0.66 kcal/mol) and LP(2)O5→ BD*(1)C23–H40 (0.68 kcal/mol) stabilization energies (E(2)) indicated that the C–H–O interactions are weak. Based on the TD-DFT results, the studied molecule showed five intense electronic transition bands. The longest wavelength and most intense electronic transition band at 242.7 nm (exp. 231 nm) are due to H-2/H→ L+1 excitations. The higher polarizability and lower energy gap of the studied compound indicate its better NLO material than urea."
718,Multifunctional TiO microspheres-rGO as highly active visible light photocatalyst and antimicrobial agent,2018-08-01,"TiO2 Microspheres-rGO has been successfully prepared and characterized using different techniques. The prepared nanocomposites show enhanced activity for the photocatalytic degradation of Methyl Orange (MO) under visible light irradiation with rate constant up to 39× 10–3 min–1. The presence of rGO sheets decreases the band gap energy of TiO2 microspheres from 3.15 to 2.6 eV. Hence, a significant enhancement in the optical absorbance in the visible light was achieved with rGO-TiO2 as compared to pure TiO2 microspheres. Additionally, the antimicrobial activity of the microspheres composites against broad range of Gram positive and Gram Negative bacteria is investigated. TiO2 Microspheres-rGO nanocomposites shows enhanced antibacterial activity compared to pure TiO2 or pure GO. The enhancement of the antimicrobial properties of TiO2-rGO is attributed to the synergic effect between TiO2 and GO. The advantages of GO and TiO2 nanoparticles makes it difficult for bacteria to develop resistance compared to traditional antibiotics. Predominantly, the maximum zone of inhibition was noted against the Gram-negative bacterium (up to 34±0.5 mm), which is attributed to the structural difference in the cell walls of both bacteria. The presented results demonstrate a bi-functional activity of the synthesized nanocomposite for wastewater disinfection. This provides a model of multifunctional material with superior activity for wastewater disinfection from microorganisms in addition to organic/inorganic pollutants."
719,Uniaxial tension/compression effects on the electrical properties of carbon nanotube bundles: A first-principles study,2018-08-01,"In this work, we studied the effect of uniaxial tension/compression on the electrical properties of carbon nanotube bundles within the framework of density functional theory. The bundles consist of mono-chirality single-walled carbon nanotubes. The band gap response of the bundles shows different electrical characteristics including band gap opening, closing and non-linear behaviors, where the affected band gap is significantly dependent on the chirality of the constituent tubes. Calculations reveal that the bundles express a systematic down-shift in the Fermi energy as a consequence of the applied tension, and a systematic up-shift in the Fermi energy in response to the applied compression. Furthermore, the simulation results show a nonlinear behavior in Fermi energy for bundles under test. This nonlinear behavior in Fermi energy may be caused by asymmetrical electronic effects in both conduction and valance bands. For all bundles, the weak wall-to-wall interactions have considerable effects on electrical properties compared to single-walled carbon nanotubes. We hope this study does not only provide helpful enlightenment on the effects of uniaxial strain on electrical properties of bundles, but also opens exciting opportunities for potential applications of piezoresistive nano-devices."

Ti3Al interface layers connect the composite layers with the TC4 titanium alloy layers. The performance of the composite sheets exhibits anisotropy. The mechanical properties of the composite sheets perpendicular to the laminated structure are obviously higher than that of the composite sheets parallel to the laminated structure. Especially, the flexural strength and fracture toughness of the composite sheet with the theoretical amount of 10 wt% Ti2AlC are 1346.98 MPa and 67.72 MPa·m1  /  2, respectively. Due to the synthetic actions, the flexural strength of the composite sheets are significantly improved by the fine TiAl grains through doping TiC so that the plasticity of the composite layers is improved with more crystal surfaces of α 2-γ phase on any stress section. What' more, not only the efficient obstruction of the carbides particles to the crack propagation, but also the passivation of the toughening layers on the crack extension can also improve the toughness of the composite sheets."

Moreover, the emission color of the BaLaGa3O7: Pr3+,Tb3+ phosphors was tuned to white by adjusting the Tb3+ ion concentration. The PL spectra revealed that there is an efficient energy transfer (ET) from Tb3+ to Pr3+ ions and the ET efficiency was found to be as high as 61.9%. These obtained white light-emitting BaLaGa3O7: Pr3+,Tb3+ phosphors were expected to be a potential candidate for phosphor converted white light-emitting diode applications."

La(NO3)3·6H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and terephthalic acid were used to form La-MOF-5 by an innovative parallel flow-drop solvothermal method. The structure and properties of La-MOF-5 were characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The relationship between microstructure stability and macroscopic properties are illustrated. The results show that the doped lanthanum is beneficial to improve the thermal stability and CO2 adsorption property of MOF-5 because of the improvement of microstructure. On the other hand, the introduction of lanthanum to MOF-5 is beneficial to form porous frameworks and to raise the thermal stability and CO2 adsorption property. The crystallinity, structure, morphology and thermal stability of La-MOF-5 are best at the La-content 2.5 atom%."
724,Facile synthesize of upconversion -NaYF capped with waterborne polyurethane prepolymer for packaging anti-counterfeiting,2018-06-01,"Due to unique optical properties and high information concealment, upconversion materials, with excellent luminescent properties and good water dispersibility, have received significant attention in many fields recently, particularly for packaging anti-counterfeiting. In a vast majority of parameters, chelating ligands played an essential role in controlling the phase structure, morphology and surface characteristics of the upconversion materials, thus produced an effect on photoluminescent properties. Herein, we demonstrated a facile hydrothermal synthetic strategy of β-NaYF4 upconversion microcrystals using waterborne polyurethane (WPU) prepolymer as the ligand. In order to achieve high intensity, the WPU polymer was prepared through molecular design and optimized preparation process, and the influence of WPU prepolymer with different ammonia contents on the luminescence property of the crystals was investigated thoroughly. The results of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) indicated that the as-prepared NaYF4 crystal possessed hexagonal phase structure, a forked rod shape, high crystallinity and excellent crystal quality. Interestingly, the crystal capped with WPU prepolymer possessed good water dispersibility and its fluorescence intensity at 540 nm was 10∼15 times as higher as that of the crystal chelated with trisodium citrate (TSC) or ligand-free. The possible reasons have been proposed. It was demonstrated that the β-NaYF4 (Er3+/Tm3+, Yb3+/Er3+ or Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped) crystals capped with WPU prepolymer would be promising candidates to prepare waterborne RGB anti-counterfeit inks which were eco-friendly and suitable for stamping designable patterns and handwriting on flexible packaging substrates. The patterns and handwritings were invisible under ambient conditions, while displayed bright multicolor fluorescence upon 980 nm irradiation, which confirmed that the as-prepared crystals exhibited high potential in packaging anti-counterfeiting."

The prepared zeolites were characterized and modified using a cationic surfactant. The removal of methyl orange (MO) dyes from aqueous solution by LTA and ZP as adsorbent was studied by applying the response surface method (RSM). A quadratic model was developed to relate the MO removal rate to the main independent variables, namely the solution pH (in the 3–9 range), the initial MO concentration (in the 20–100 mg/L range), and the adsorbent mass (200–1000 mg/L). The modified MLTA was found to be a more effective adsorbent relative to the modified MZP. In addition, MLTA mass exerted the greatest influence on the MO removal process under the studied conditions. However, when MZP zeolite was used as an adsorbent, the pH of the solution was the most influential factor. The two quadratic models were found to be statistically significant."

Here, we report the preparation of strip patterned silver nanoparticle (Ag NP) platforms by room-temperature imprinting and their fluorescence enhancement performance for a near-infrared fluorescent dye of cyanine-5. The poly(acrylic acid)/poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAA/PAH) multilayer film was constructed as the underlying film before the deposition of Ag NPs to provide the good compressibility and fluidity for the room-temperature imprinting. Subsequently, Ag NPs were spray-assembled on the underlying film of PAA/PAH. Depending on the sequence between the room-temperature imprinting and the spraying of Ag NPs, the pattern-spraying and the spray-patterning procedures were respectively implemented for fabricating strip patterned Ag NP platforms. The resulting patterned Ag NP platforms both exhibited stronger capabilities in fluorescence enhancement compared to the planar Ag NP platform. The pattern-sprayed Ag NP platform has a convex strip structure composed of Ag NP film and a fluorescence enhancement of 1.39-fold in comparison with the planar Ag NP platform. In contrast, the spray-patterned Ag NP platform possessed a higher improvement of 2.05-fold, relying on a concavo-convex strip structure.

A metal oxide (Ag2O, CuO or ZnO)-containing phase was employed as a component with reactive functionality, which was supported on EG as a component with adsorptive functionality. The reaction products of the adsorptive degradation of 2-chloroethylethylsulfide (CEES), a simulant of the well-known chemical warfare agent sulfur mustard (HD), were characterized by solid-state and solution NMR techniques. The elimination and hydrolysis reactions in the decontamination of CEES were shown to occur catalytically over the EG/Ag2O composite. The molecular adsorption products of OCu· · ·SC4H9Cl surface complexes and OZnO–CH2CH2SC2H5 surface-bound alkoxy species contributed to the decontamination of CEES on the surface of the EG/CuO and EG/ZnO composites, respectively. All reaction products exhibited a lower toxicity than CEES, meaning that the EG/MO composites exhibited self-detoxifying properties."
733,Enhanced UV emission of TiO–ZnO nanocomposite films synthesized by simplified sol–gel dip-coating method,2018-06-01,"TiO2–ZnO composite film was regarded as a promising candidate for UV emitter devices. For exploring a lower cost and convenient preparation method for highly efficient UV-emission TiO2–ZnO composite film, we used a simplified method in which mixing ZnO sol and TiO2 sol directly to prepare TiO2–ZnO nanocomposite films with a varied atomic ratio of Zn/(Ti+Zn) (TiO2, Z20, Z40, Z60, Z80, ZnO) on glass substrates and discussed its optical properties for the first time in this study. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra indicated that the UV emission of the composite films was greatly enhanced compared with that showed by single-phase TiO2 or ZnO film. In particular, the UV emission intensity of Z60 composite film was enhanced by a factor of 10 compared to that of single-phase ZnO or TiO2. The enhanced PL intensity of the composite films could be attributed to fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)."

Graphene is a well-known 2D material which does not have a bandgap. After the intensive study, other 2D materials have been also focused by many researchers. One of the materials is Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) which is currently the most promising 2D semiconductor material. In this paper, we synthesize hybrid layer which consists of graphene and MoS2 to fabricate a diode and report the synthesis method of the hybrid film and the electrical properties of the device. Graphene is synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and transfer to a target substrate (Si/SiO2). And then MoS2 is directly deposited on the graphene layer using Mo(CO)6 and H2S gases.

However, conventional sealing materials, which are utilized for CBM drainage of boreholes, exhibited several deficiencies, including autogenous shrinkage (e.g., Portland cement), poor strength (e.g., Polyurethane), high wastage rate (e.g., Mucus), etc. With respect to these weaknesses, cement-based sealing materials were prepared using cement and other additives. In this paper, the effects of the expansion sources, involving expansive agents, i.e., the content of Al powder and MgO powder, on the performance of cement-based sealing materials were investigated. In addition, the impacts of expansion field, involving the circumstance factors (i.e., water-cement ratio, temperature, and pH values) on the performance of cement-based sealing materials were assessed as well. The micro-structure and the compressive strength of cement-based sealing materials were determined and verified using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and an Electrical Universal Testing Machine (EUTM), respectively. According to the achieved results, it can be concluded that cement-based sealing materials can be widely used for determining parameters of coal seam gas, hydraulic fracturing, treating coal seam gas water injection, etc."
737,Effect of MWCNTs surface properties on lipase immobilization and its catalytic activity,2018-04-01,"This study investigates the surface properties effect of high aspect ratio synthesized MWCNTs on the immobilization efficiency, and the catalytic activity of Candidia rugosa lipase enzyme for olive oil hydrolysis reactions. High aspect ratio MWCNTs (H-MWCNTs) and low aspect ratio MWCNTs (L-MWCNTs) were synthesized in a vertical injection CVD reactor. These two customized MWCNTs types were compared to commercial MWCNTs (C-MWCNTs) with a lower aspect ratio, but higher surface area as confirmed by SEM and BET characterizations. All MWCNTs were functionalized by nitric acid treatment followed by the immobilization of lipase. FTIR and TGA characterization confirmed the functionalization of all MWCNTs types with carboxyl groups and the covalent attachment of lipase. In addition, TGA showed that the variation of the aspect ratio and surface area did not significantly affect the percent lipase loading, although H-MWCNTs had the highest loading of 43%. Immobilization of lipase on all three types of MWCNTs increased the amount of fatty acids produced from the hydrolysis of olive oil. C-MWCNTs showed the highest lipase activity (35 μmol · min–1 · mg–1) due to their higher surface area, which enhanced the dispersion of lipase in the oil emulsion interface region. H-MWCNTs demonstrated the lowest lipase activity (10.4 μmol · min–1 · mg–1) due to their long bundled structure that restricts the movement of lipase molecules lowering their contact with the substrate."

739,"Synthesis and characterization of NaYF:Yb, Er up-conversion phosphors/poly(vinyl alcohol) composite fluorescent films",2018-04-01,"Luminescent polymer composite films were prepared by aqueous solution casting method employing poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as a matrix polymer and NaYF4:Yb, Er up-conversion phosphors (UCPs) as the filler. A series of luminescent UCP/PVA composite films were obtained by varying the amount of the UCP filler. The effects of UCP incorporation on the structure, morphology, thermal stability and optical properties were also examined. The well-dispersed UCPs in the polymer matrix enhanced the thermal stability of composite films due to hydrogen bonding between the PVA and UCPs. Besides, the incorporation of UCPs did not greatly decrease the transparency of films but imparted fluorescent properties to the polymer matrix. The fabricated UCP/PVA composite films exhibited strong up-conversion photoluminescence upon the 980 nm laser excitation. The UCP/PVA composite fluorescent films may have promising application in anti-counterfeiting packaging and in other optics related fields."

The influence of GNPs on the hydration degree, microstructure and chloride permeability of the cement paste is systematically investigated. The experimental results show that the addition of GNPs refined the pore structure and decreased the chloride migration coefficient. It is clearly indicated that the very low fraction of GNPs (0.1%) can effectively hinder the ingress of chloride ions. Additionally, the sulfate corrosion is also enhanced by GNPs with a moderate of 0.1%. The improvement chloride permeability and is not only attribute to the excellent properties of GNPs itself but also the higher hydration degree, lower porosity and the effect of GNPs such as crack arresting, and barrier effect. It is concluded that GNPs has a great potential for reinforcing the durability of cement paste."
741,Investigation on the pozzolanic properties of rice straw ash prepared at different temperatures,2018-04-01,"This study explains the influence of different temperature on the engineering properties of rice straw ash (RSA) and its reactivity as a pozzolanic material. Rice straw ash is used as natural pozzolana, prepared by burning at open atmosphere and three different controlled temperatures (400 °C, 600 °C and 750 °C), as this process is economic. For construction purposes, it will be difficult to extract huge amounts of silica material from rice straw by putting it in acid or basic treatment. The physiological and mineralogical aspects of rice straw ash samples were studied throughout the research. The particular size analysis and field emission gun-scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM) identify that that the average diameter of RSA particles prepared at 400 °C to 750 °C, are within the range of 400–800 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis ratify that the main composition of RSA is silica. And most of the silica particles are amorphous and porous in nature, which fit the nature of a pozzolanic material. The pozzolanic reactivity of RSA shows that the compressive strength of RSA blended with lime mortar increases as the number of curing day increases."
742,Color-fading reaction mechanisms of TiO-coated photoluminescent materials,2018-04-01,"This paper presented underlying methylene blue (MB) color-fading mechanisms by photoluminescence-photocatalysis (PL-PC) reaction with PL materials coated with titanium dioxide (TiO2). The color fading mechanism means the photocatalytic degradation of organic dye by the coated TiO2 photocatalyst. The photocatalyst is activated by photoluminescent material. For PL materials, SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+ (SAOED) and water resistant SAOED were selected for its long-lasting after-glow characteristics and well-known PL effect. All the tests were performed on a solution basis. The TiO2 coating played an important role in the subsequent MB color-fading reactions as revealed by a comparative study performed in dark and white light conditions. The presented results also revealed that the MB color-fading reaction involves two major mechanisms. The first mechanism is adsorption by the hydrolysis product of SAOED, that is, Al(OH)3. The second is photocatalytic degradation by the TiO2 coating layer activated by the photoluminescent light. These results revealed color-fading mechanisms by PL-PC, which have potential for mechanochromic sensing characteristics since the tested materials are known to have mechanoluminescence properties."
743,Hydrothermal synthesis and photoluminescence properties of Cu-doped ZnSe quantum dots using glutathione as stabilizer,2018-04-01,"In the present work, the direct preparation of Cu-doped ZnSe quantum dots (ZnSe:Cu QDs) via hydrothermal route using L-glutathione (GSH) as a stabilizer was investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis absorption, and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopies. Structural investigations indicated that the GSH capping ZnSe:Cu QDs were about 3 nm in size, showing size-dependent optical properties of the prepared QDs. The as-synthesized ZnSe:Cu QDs were observed to emit green fluorescence at 468 nm when excited at 321 nm. The effect of the several experimental factors was surveyed and the optimum conditions was found to be: hydrothermal time, 60 min; pH of reaction solution, 10.5; molar ratio of GSH-to-Zn, 1.2; Cu2+ doping amount, 5%."
744,Beta- and gamma-cyclodextrin ionophores as electroactive materials for construction of new polyvinyl chloride sensors for eletriptan based on host-guest recognition,2018-04-01,"The construction and development of polyvinyl chloride environmentally-friendly sensors for eletriptan hydrobromide (ELT) are developed. The sensing materials incorporated β- or γ-cyclodextrin as the electroactive material (sensor 1 and 2, respectively), with potassium tetrakis (4-chlorophenyl)borate as an ionic additive, polyvinyl chloride as the matrix material, and dioctyl phthalate as a plasticizer. Between pH 4 and pH 8.5, sensors 1 and 2 exhibited fast, stable, and near-Nernstian responses (58.9 and 57.5 mV/decade, respectively) over an eletriptan concentration range of 10–2–10–6 M; the detection limits were 4 ×10–6 and 6 ×10–6 M, respectively. The selectivity coefficients of the investigated sensors were very low, which indicated that the method was free from interference. The determination of eletriptan content from its dosage form resulted in average recoveries of 97.86% and 100% and mean relative standard deviations of 2.16% and 2.42% for the β- and γ-cyclodextrin sensors, respectively. The determined values were similar to those obtained by an ultraviolet spectrophotometric method. Molecular modeling was used to calculate the host-guest relations between eletriptan and β- or γ-cyclodextrin. The lowest binding free energy was –6.15 and –7.89 kcal/mol for the host-guest complexes with a 1:1 stoichiometry of eletriptan and β- or γ-cyclodextrin, respectively."

In this work, we demonstrate a novel approach to developing semitransparent and color-tunable solar cells using a MoO3/metal/MoO3 structure as the device electrode. By changing the type of metal used in transparent anode stack, the transmission spectra of the semitransparent cells could be tuned over the visible-light region (400–750 nm). Semitransparent solar cells with blue–green, green, and greyish–green color showed bifacial energy generation when illuminated from either the bottom or top side. Our semitransparent color-tunable solar cells fabricated in air showed an average efficiency of 3% under AM 1.5G illumination."
746,A new route for the preparation of superhydrophobic surfaces via milling operation,2018-04-01,"Mechanical operation is a promising attempt to develop superhydrophobic surfaces. But at present many methods are dependent on ultra-precision processing equipment and technology which increase the fabrication cost and limit their practical application. This paper discusses a simple and effective method to prepare superhydrophobic surfaces by a combination of milling operation on a common milling machine and stearic acid modification. By adjusting the rotational speed and feed rate, regular groove-like microstructures are fabricated on the machined aluminium alloy surfaces. The surfaces are superhydrophobic with water contact angles higher than 150° and sliding angles about 10° after the modification. The sample surfaces were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and water contact angle measurements. The present method can have a good prospect in future industrial application due to its great efficiency, low cost and simple fabrication."
747,Current status of single-walled carbon nanotube synthesis from metal catalysts by chemical vapor deposition,2018-02-01,"To realize the application of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in the electronics field, chirality control of SWCNTs is desirable. However, the selective growth of semiconducting versus metallic SWCNTs has not yet been realized, and further improvement of growth techniques is necessary. Therefore, understanding the growth mechanism of SWCNTs remains an important issue. At present, catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques are commonly used for SWCNT growth because they are suitable for mass production at reduced growth temperatures. In this review, studies on SWCNTs synthesized using various metallic catalysts are surveyed and the current understanding of the SWCNT growth mechanism is presented. In addition, the development of low-temperature growth, another important topic for electronics applications, is discussed."
748,Poly(N-vinyl caprolactam) thermoresponsive polymer in novel drug delivery systems: A review,2018-02-01,"Thermoresponsive polymers have been attractively and scientifically significant in the recent years due to the utilization of various pharmaceutical and biomedical formulations. Poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PNVCL) is a temperature-responsive polymer, only second to poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), the most popular temperature-responsive polymer. PNVCL should be considered an important focus due to the phase transition temperature of such polymer that is close to the physiological temperature. PNVCL is a polymer which offers unrivaled qualities for different potential medical device applications. Specifically, it offers one kind of thermoresponsive abilities, which satisfies the material innovation imperatives required in focused drug delivery applications. PNVCL and PNIPAM polymers are well-studied thermoresponsive abilities since its lower critical solution temperature (LCST) is near the physiological temperature and has mostly been used in biomedical applications. Therefore, it can be investigated as a potential candidate for pharmaceutical utilization. This review highlights a comparison of PNVCL with PNIPAM regarding comparable characteristics which also delve into selected examples and the most recent published of applications based on PNVCL with a specific focus on drug delivery system. The consequence exhibits that the PNVCL will play a pivotal role in nanotechnology and the environment."
749,Silver-doped manganese based nanocomposites for aerial oxidation of alcohols,2018-02-01,"Silver oxide nanoparticles doped manganese carbonates and manganese oxide catalysts were synthesized via a simple co-precipitation approach, which upon calcination at temperatures such as 300 °C, 400 °C, and 500 °C, yields different manganese carbonate such as, [Ag2O(1%)–MnCO3] and manganese oxides [Ag2O(1%)–MnO2] and [Ag2O(1%)–Mn2O3]. Comparative catalytic study investigations were carried out to assess the catalytic efficiency between the carbonates and oxides for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol and 1-phenylethanol in presence of molecular oxygen as a green oxidizing agent without using other oxidants additives or bases. Different loadings of Ag2O(0–5% w/w) were doped in MnO2 support, amongst which Ag2O(1%)–MnO2 catalyst showed best catalytic performance. The influence of catalyst loading, reaction time, calcination temperature, catalyst amount employed, and reaction temperature have been entirely examined using oxidation of benzyl alcohol and 1-phenylethanol into benzaldehyde and acetophenone respectively. The Ag2O(1%)–MnO2 calcined at 400 °C exhibited the best catalytic activity and possessed highest surface area which suggests that the calcination treatment and surface area play a fundamental role in the oxidation process. A 100% conversion product with selectivity >99% was accomplished within relatively short reaction time 60 mins and 50 mins for benzyl alcohol and 1-phenylethanol oxidation respectively. It was also found that Ag2O nanoparticles perform a significant part in augmenting the catalytic activity for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols. Microscopic techniques such as SEM, EDX, TEM and spectroscopic techniques such as XRD, FT-IR, TGA, and BET were employed to characterize the synthesized catalysts. A variety of benzylic, aliphatic, allylic, heteroaromatic, primary, and secondary alcohols were selectively oxidized into their corresponding aldehydes and ketones with 100% conversion without any over-oxidation i.e., acids formation. The prepared catalyst could be recovered and reused five subsequent reaction cycles without discernible decrease in its catalytic performance and the selectivity remained almost unchanged."
750,Creep and recovery behaviors of chemically induced grafted low density polyethylene films containing silanized hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets,2018-02-01,"Few layers boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) were derived from precursors of specially synthesized micro-sized hexagonal boron nitrides (h-BNs) of large flakes through microfluidization. They were then considered promising filler constituent for improving creep and recovery behaviors of low density polyethylene (LDPE) films. To enhance the compatibility between BNNSs and LDPE matrix, attachment of trimethoxy silane (VTS) coupling agent to the surface of BNNSs was performed through microfluidization, followed by chemically induced graft copolymerization of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) onto the surface of LDPE beads by utilizing benzoyl peroxide as initiator. LDPE-g-HEMA films containing various amounts (0.3, 0.5 and 1 wt.%) of silanized BNNSs were consecutively produced, conducting melt extrusion. Neat LDPE films and LDPE-g-HEMA films with and without untreated BNNSs (1 wt.%), were also produced in the same way for the sake of comparison. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examination showed that morphology of BNNSs was altered after silane treatment, and that silanized BNNSs were dispersed in the form of exfoliated sheets within the grafted film. Creep and recovery behaviors of the resulting films were determined using a Thermal Mechanical Analyzer (TMA). As a result, regardless of the weight content, the grafted films with silanized BNNSs were found to exhibit low creep recovery compliance combined with low maximum creep strain as compared to neat LDPE films and the grafted films with untreated BNNSs, suggesting that mobility of the grafted matrix molecules has become more restricted when they were brought in contact with the silane molecules on the surface of BNNSs. Various different models, including the Findley's power law, Burgers, and Weibull distribution were then proposed to fit the experimentally determined creep and recovery data in order to gain more insight into the effect of untreated and silanized BNNSs on the film deformation mechanisms. The findings obtained were then briefly discussed with respect to theoretical predictions."
751,Enhanced structural and magnetic properties of carbon-assisted ZnO nanorod arrays on (100) Si substrate,2018-02-01,"We have fabricated as-grown ZnO nanorods (NRs) and carbon-assisted NRs arrays on semi-insulating (100)-oriented Si substrates. We compared the structural and magnetic properties of them. HRTEM (High Resolution Transmission Microscopy), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) revealed that the as-grown ZnO NRs and carbon-assisted ZnO NRs were single crystals with a hexagonal wurtzite structure, and grew with a c-axis orientation perpendicular to the Si substrate. These measurements show that the carbon-assisted ZnO NRs were better synthesized vertically on a Si substrate compared to the as-grown ZnO NRs. Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements showed that defect concentration of the carbon-assisted ZnO NRs was remarkably reduced compared to the as-grown ZnO NRs. The reduced defect concentration of the carbon-assisted ZnO demonstrates the possible improvement in the performance of photovoltaic nanodevices based on ZnO like materials. This method can be applied to the fabrication of well-aligned ZnO nanorod used widely in optoelectronic devices."
752,High-performance poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) based electrospun polyelectrolyte mat for lithium-ion battery,2018-02-01,"Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) copolymer was modified by chemical treatments to obtain functionalized material for the preparation of electrolytes suitable for application in Lithium polymer battery. The PVdF-HFP was chemically modified by dehydrofluorination/sulphonation, reaction with acrylate and also by grafting of tertiary butyl acrylamide using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The PVdF-HFP modified by various chemical treatments was elecrospun into fibrous mat and also cast into films. Polyelectrolytes were prepared by introducing lithium ions into the nanofibrous mat and films of modified PVdF-HFP. The chemical modification occurred on PVdF-HFP was confirmed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FTIR) analysis. The ionic conductivity, thermal stability, morphological characteristics of electrospun nanofibers and films prepared from both unmodified and chemically modified PVdF-HFP were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) respectively. The electrolytes produced in the form of nanofibers possess improved thermal stability and ionic conductivity due to the presence of micropores. The ionic conductivity of the chemically modified PVdF-HFP electrospun nanofibrous electrolyte was observed in the range of 1.09 × 10–3 Scm–1, which is greater than the ionic conductivity of chemically modified PVdF-HFP films. This is due to the large surface area and porous structure of the nanofibrous mat which facilitate the uptake of large amount of liquid electrolyte. The chemically modified PVdF-HFP nanofibrous electrolyte developed in the present work would be a promising candidate for enhancing the performance of Lithium batteries."
753,Effect of surfactant's molecular weight on the wettability of vinyl polysiloxane impression materials after immersion disinfection,2018-02-01,"The aim of this study was to develop novel hydrophilic vinyl polysiloxane (VPS) materials incorporating novel hydrophilic agents (Rhodasurf CET-2 and CET-5). In addition, experimental material's wetting properties (contact angles) were compared with commercial materials upon immersion in various media. Three commercial (Aquasil Ultra-Monophase [Aq M], Elite HD-Monophase [Elt M], Extrude Medium-bodied [Extr M]) and five experimental (Exp I–V) materials were used in this study. The contact angles were measured at time intervals (10, 30, 60 and 120 s), immediately after setting and after immersion using a Drop Shape Analysis (DSA). The results were analyzed statistically using the SPSS software. The largest contact angle (at 10 s) was recorded for Elt M (108.78 ± 6.04) that was significantly larger (p < 0.05) than Aq M (36.19 ± 4.05) and Extr M (44.65 ± 3.11). The contact angles for experimental materials Exp-I (108.35 ± 4.45), Exp-II (104.08 ± 4.70) closely matched to Elt M (108.78 ± 6.04) however were significantly larger (p < 0.05) than other experimental groups Exp-III (68.50 ± 4.29), Exp-IV (35.26 ± 3.46), Exp-V (24.47 ± 5.92) and commercial materials Aq M (36.19 ± 4.05) and Extr M (44.65 ± 3.11). In conclusion, the experimental vinyl polysiloxane materials containing the surfactant (Rhodasurf CET-2) showed lower contact angles compared to controls (Exp-I and Exp-II) and commercial vinyl polysiloxane impression materials. The decrease in contact angles was dependent on the concentration of surfactant (Rhodasurf CET-2) in the materials. In addition, the smaller molecular weight surfactant (Rhodasurf CET-2) resulted in lower contact angles compared to the larger molecular weight surfactant (Rhodasurf CET-5)."
754,Theoretical study of extrinsic fluorescence probe reacting with volatile organic compounds,2018-02-01,"A novel sensor-based method named extrinsic fluorescence probe (EFP) has been developed to detect and evaluate food quality and food security with low-cost, sensitive, rapid and simple advantages. Theoretical study using density functional theory (DFT) at B3LYP/LANL2DZ level was carried out to investigate the ability of EFP sensor binding VOCs. SnP is selected to represent EFP sensor because of its importance in EFP system. The binding energies relating to the process of SnP reacting with VOCs were obtained by subtracting the before-reaction energy from the after-reaction energy for each model. The binding energies for all models were classified into three groups that will be helpful in the further sensor design to detect and evaluate food quality and food security. Furthermore, this study also suggests that the theoretical study is useful for the optimization of similar EFP sensor."

However, these photodetectors are usually suffered from long response time and vacuum-required measurement environment. In this study, nitrogen-doped rGOQDs were synthesized by the improved Hummers method and DMF hydrothermal treatment approach, while DMF was used as a reducing reagent to enhance the photoresponse of rGOQDs. Hybrid photodetector with rGOQDs on graphene was fabricated using Al2O3 as capping layer. High photoresponsivity of 2.1 × 106 V/W and response time of 0.13 s were obtained at deep-UV under ambient environment, and enhanced photoresponse was observed in solar-blind wavelength compared to normal UV light.

This paper provide a feasible way for the fabrication of solar-blind photodetectors with high responsivity, fast response time and ambient condition performance, which are important for the community of photodetection."
757,Polymeric hydrogels for post-operative adhesion prevention: A review,2017-12-01,"Post-operative adhesion is one of the most common and serious complication of surgery. It always results in chronic pain, ischemia, bowel obstruction, dyskinesia and even cumbersome reoperation, which has markedly increased the suffering of patients. Although considerable progress has been made in tissue adhesion reduction, complete prevention of post-surgical adhesions remains a big challenge in clinical practices. Among interventions against this complication, the application of physical barrier has been accepted as the optimized strategy. Especially, polymeric hydrogel based barriers have attracted increasing attention in both preclinical studies and clinical trials. Herein, we review the role of the polymeric hydrogels in post-operative adhesion prevention, covering the most common used natural or synthetic polymer systems. Besides their preparation, properties and application in different tissue adhesion cases, as well as their combination with anti-adhesion drugs have been emphasized."

The effect of magnetic nanoparticles must be known to show low cytotoxicity and be ascertained prior to their use for wastewater treatment. Synthesized chelating ligands considerably improve the adsorbing capabilities of magnetic nanoparticles in wastewater. This paper (with over 100 refs) discusses the influence of surface modification on the efficiency of magnetic nanoparticles for the removal of heavy metals in wastewater.

759,"Adsorptive removal of chlorobenzene from wastewater using synthesized zeolite X: Equilibrium, kinetics and thermodynamics",2017-12-01,"The coal fly ash (CFA), obtained from Ontario Power Generation (OPG), was used to synthesize zeolite X (SZX). Zeolite SZX was used as adsorbent to remove the mono chlorobenzene from a simulated wastewater stream. Zeolite SZX was analyzed using XRD, FTIR, SEM, BET and XRF. To investigate the adsorption performance of chlorobenzene onto SZX zeolite by batch adsorption experiments, a series of tests were performed at different parameters, i.e., the temperature (298–318 K), contact time (0–5) hrs and initial concentration of chlorobenzene (100–300 mgL–1). In addition, the effect of adsorbent dose (0.03–0.20 g · L–1) was investigated. A maximum of 97.2% removal of chlorobenzene was obtained under these conditions. Langmuir and Freundlich models were applied to evaluate the equilibrium isotherms for the adsorption process. The collected data from the adsorption tests were well fitted to both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The adsorption kinetics data were well defined by a pseudo-second-order kinetic model,  R 2 value between (0.9889–0.9982). Thermodynamic analysis proved that this adsorption process was an endothermic (ΔH 0 was found as 31.6463 kJ/mol) and spontaneous process under these specified conditions. All in all, the results presented in this paper implied that the SZX zeolite is a promising adsorbent for elimination of chlorobenzene from wastewater."
760,Using methionine as an environment-friendly corrosion inhibitor for copper–nickel alloy in a chloride solution,2017-12-01,"The corrosion inhibition behavior of an environment-friendly amino acid-methionine (Met) and its synergetic effect with sodium silicate (SS) for copper–nickel alloy (Cu–10Ni) in 3.5% sodium chloride solution were investigated by electrochemical measurement, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR) characterization. The results show that Met, as a cathode corrosion inhibitor, has the highest inhibitive efficiency of 62% at an additive concentration of 40 ppm. When 20 ppm Met and 20 ppm SS are added simultaneously, the inhibitive efficiency is increased to 90% due to a compact and uniform film formed on the surface of the cupronickel specimen under the synergetic effect of two corrosion inhibitors. The existence of characteristic functional groups of these two corrosion inhibitors is confirmed by FTIR results, which indicates that there exists the combination inhibition for corrosion protecting the copper alloy."

The exfoliation process was examined with a variety of characterization techniques, including UV/Vis spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results show that the natural graphite was successfully exfoliated into graphene sheets after sonication and microfluidization process. The lateral size of the flakes is in the range of 0.5–2 μm. The maximum achieved FLG concentration is 0.47 mg/ml, and the thickness of most of the obtained products is less than 5 layers. The value of I D /I G for the FLG is 0.59, which suggests a low number of defects and a high graphitic degree. Moreover, the obtained graphene dispersion was stable for more than 6 months."

It was then introduced into polyethylene, and colloidal silicone rubber was used as an infrared and microwave absorber. The infrared shielding effectiveness was investigated by measuring the thermal extinction in the range of 8–12 μm using a thermal imager. The microwave-absorbing properties of the materials were investigated by measuring the reflection loss in the ranges of 2–18 and 26.5–40 GHz using a network analyzer, employing the free space method. The effects of structure, medium material (carbonyl iron powder or Fe3O4) and weight ratio on the infrared/microwave attenuation properties of magnetic expanded graphite were also studied. The thermal extinction of magnetic expanded graphite at a concentration of 2 mg/cm3 reached 40 °C, and at a weight ratio (expanded graphite/magnetic iron particles) of 4 wt.%/30 wt.% and a thickness of 2.0 mm, the minimum reflection loss was –15 dB in the 2–18 GHz range and –13 dB in the 26.5–40 GHz range. The innovative magnetic expanded graphite developed in this study had excellent infrared and microwave interference abilities, and this new material could be used for simultaneous infrared and microwave attenuation."
763,A safe and efficient approach to fabricate black carbon-doped rutile titania by substitution of oxygen at carbon sites in titanium carbide film,2017-12-01,"Black carbon-doped rutile titania (C-doped TiO2) have been successfully fabricated by substitution of oxygen (O) at carbon (C) sites in titanium carbide (TiC), via annealing in carbon powder to control oxygen pressure around TiC film. Compared with that of substitution of C at O sites in TiO2, C-doped TiO2 fabricated by substitution of O at C sites in TiC fundamentally increase the visible-light absorption and enhances photocatalytic activity. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results reveal that rutile TiO2 forms on TiC. The increased visible-light absorption and the decreased recombination between electron and hole are demonstrated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption and photoluminescence (PL). Black C-doped TiO2/TiC films show strong visible-light absorption, and C-doped TiO2 grow from TiC could form the heterojunction to promote the separation of electron–hole pairs."
764,Tuning electronic properties and band gap engineering of defective carbon nanotube bundles: First principles calculations,2017-12-01,"In this work, we theoretically studied band gap and Fermi energy response to uni-axial strain for defective carbon nanotubes bundles. We found that chirality plays a crucial role in band gap variations, while uni-axial strains show different responses and characteristics in the band gap. Besides, chiral ''(n, n/2) for (n/3) ≠ integer'' in nanotubes bundle shows different characteristics including band gap opening/closing with non-linear behavior. Furthermore, our results reveal that both defective carbon nanotubes bundles under study show close to systematic down shifts followed by up shifts in the Fermi energy in response to the applied uni-axial strains, respectively. Besides, our simulation results show a parabolic behavior in Fermi energy as well. This nonlinear behavior in Fermi energy may attributed to uneven electronic effects in both valence and conduction bands, whereas, these bands are directly responsible for the Fermi energy parabolic behavior. Our results are not only providing helpful understanding to the electronic properties of defective carbon nanotube bundles under uni-axial strain, but also opening an interesting opportunity for potential and future applications of bidirectional carbon nanotube bundles based electronic devices."
765,Combined effect of the indium content and well width on electroluminescence in InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well-based LEDs,2017-12-01,"Two InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well (MQW)-based blue LEDs emitting photons at approximately the same wavelength, with different indium contents and well widths, are grown, and the injection current dependence of their electroluminescence peak energies and linewidths at different temperatures are investigated. The results show that, compared with sample B, with the lower indium content and larger well width, sample A, with the higher indium content and smaller well width, exhibits significant electron leakage. This is mainly attributed to the stronger piezoelectric field induced by the higher indium content in the MQWs. Moreover, compared with sample B, the significant efficiency droop of sample A further confirms that the latter has larger electron leakage and/or overflow than the former, due to the stronger piezoelectric field and smaller well width."

The compatibility, stability, and mechanical properties of toughened desensitizers were determined by theoretical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and experimental methods. Based on their modulus and elongation ratios, the optimum EVA, SBR and SBS contents in the toughened desensitizers were determined to be 8 wt%, 6 wt%, and 10 wt%, respectively. HNIW based PBXs were prepared with fluororubber 2311 (F 2311) and cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) binders, desensitized using different toughened PWs including PW/EVA, PW/SBR, and PW/SBS under optimal conditions, and analyzed for their mechanical properties, safety properties, and thermal stability. The results suggest that the toughened PW/SBR desensitizer was able to effectively reduce the sensitivity of PBXs and improve their tensile strengths. The tougheners exhibited no significant effects on the thermal ability of HNIW based PBXs.

771,Effect of voids on nanoindentation response of Fe-10%Cr alloys using molecular dynamics simulation,2017-10-01,"Nanoindentation response of single crystal Fe-10%Cr models has been investigated using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. Defect-free (DF) model and models with voids of various sizes and positioned at various locations from the indenter surface are researched. The load-displacement response of the models with layers of voids (LV) deviates from the response observed in the DF model as dislocations start interacting with voids. The depth at which this transition happens depends on the number of layers as well as the size of the voids. For models with a single void (SV), the transition occurs depending on the location of the void from the indenter surface. For the SV model with a void closer to the indenter surface, the effect of void is removed once the void is collapsed at a sufficiently large indentation depth; whereas, for model with void closer to the center, the effect of the void to the load-displacement curve is minimal. Both hardness and reduced modulus are found to be lower for models with voids when compared to DF model. The results reveal the nucleation of 〈001〉, 1/2 〈111〉, and 1/6 〈111〉 types of dislocations during indentation. The dislocation lengths and densities have been calculated for various models. The dislocation densities are found to be higher in models with voids as compared to DF model due to the interaction of dislocations with the voids."
772,Modeling of continuous wave laser melting of germanium epitaxial films on silicon substrates,2017-10-01,"The advantages of both silicon (Si) substrate and germanium (Ge) semiconductor are available for heteroepitaxy of Ge on Si substrate, which have great potential for optical applications. However, high dislocation density and rough surface occur during the epitaxial growth due to the large lattice mismatch (4.2%) between Ge and Si. Laser re-crystallization technology provides an effective way to obtain high quality Ge epitaxial films on Si substrates by horizontal release of the lattice mismatch between Si and Ge. In this work, a thermal physics model of continuous wave laser (CW) melting of Ge epitaxial films on Si substrates is developed in COMSOL Multiphysics based on heat transfer theory. The temperature distribution of the Ge on Si system predicted by the numerical simulation is discussed in detail. The purpose is to melt the Ge films and achieve re-crystallization. Some main parameters such as the laser power, the effective laser radius, the thickness of Ge layer and the initial temperature have been varied to investigate their influence on the temperature distribution. The results are in agreement with the results of experiments and can provide an important technical support for the applications of Ge/Si technology in the field of microelectronics and optoelectronics."
773,Synthesis of a novel kind of uniform fluorescent silica colloids and their assembled photonic film for sensitive detection of Cu ions,2017-10-01,"A novel fluorescent photonic crystal (FPC) film is created for the first time via self-assembly of a new kind of uniform fluorescent silica colloids. The fluorescent silica colloids have first been synthesized by combination of stöber method and direct calcination, which are then used as building blocks for formation of FPC films with opal structure via vertical deposition method. The FPC films with brilliant structural colors could be obtained, depending on fluorescent silica colloids with various diameters. Importantly, the FPC films exhibit good fluorescent property, e.g., emitting blue under 365 nm UV light. Moreover, the FPC films could be used as a sensor for highly sensitive detection of copper ions concentration via dual detection mode, fluorescence and reflection mode. The FPC films not only appear low detection of limit (DOL), but show good selectivity for copper ions, various concentrations (from 1 nM to 100 μM) of copper ions could be precisely confirmed."
774,Electron-phonon anharmonicity and low thermal conductivity in phosphorous chalcogenide ferroelectrics,2017-10-01,"The dependence of thermal conductivity with temperature has been studied for Sn(Pb)2P2S(Se)6 ferroelectrics-semiconductors, showing an ultra-low (0.5 W/m K) thermal conductivity above 250 K and the possibility to tune it at lower temperatures playing with the dopant concentration. This behavior has been explained taking into account the combination of different physical mechanisms: hopping heat conductivity in a lattice with strong electron-phonon anharmonicity linked to the stereoactivity of tin and lead cations electron lone pairs together with valence fluctuations in P2S(Se)6 groups. Besides, the presence of an incommensurate phase in the more covalent compounds, the location of tricritical points near 250 K and the peculiarities of the chemical bonding have all been correlated with the experimental behavior observed."
775,Study of energy band modulation of Ge-based material system for monolithic optoelectronic integration chips,2017-10-01,"Compared to indirect bandgap Ge semiconductors, carrier radiative recombination efficiencies of pseudo-direct bandgap Ge semiconductors (PD-Ge) with low-intensity tensile strain and direct bandgap Ge1–x Sn x  alloy (D-Ge1–x Sn x ) with high Sn component are high. Since the carrier mobility of PD-Ge and D-Ge1–x Sn x  is high, they can be applied to high-speed and high-performance electronic devices. As a result, PD-Ge and D-Ge1–x Sn x  have potential for monolithic optoelectronic integration chips (MOEIC). The energy bandgap of work area which in LED, waveguide and detector of MOEIC should meet relationship Eg,  waveguide > Eg,  LED > Eg,  detector. To achieve MOEIC, the band structures of PD-Ge and D-Ge1–x Sn x  need to be modulated. The band structures can be modulated by applying uniaxial stress using SiN film, and the process is compatible with MOEIC. In this paper, based on kp band theory combining with deformation potential, energy bandgap models of PD-Ge and D-Ge1–x Sn x  under uniaxial stress are studied, and then change rules are proposed.

In this paper, we model the interaction which is arising from the encapsulation of Cystine amino acid inside a single-walled carbon nanotube. Carbon nanotube are selective and excellent nano-devices because of their huge potential that is used in protein delivery and disease treatment. We consider two possible structures as models of Cystine amino acid which are an ellipsoid and cylinder group of atoms. We adopt the Lennard-Jones potential and continuum approach to obtain the interaction energy for each configuration. Our results indicate that the radius of nanotube plays a critical role in determining the magnitude of total energy and the encapsulation of Cystine occurs when r > 3.391 Å which are in a very good agreement with recent experimental studies. Our model predicts that the scientific researchers could design and develop new nano-devices with distinct properties to avoid the energetic barriers and increase the ability of nanoube for maximum loading of targeted drug delivery."

Meanwhile, this novel G-wall based GW-SERS substrate not only maintained the high SERS activity, but also could be easily obtained in large scale. Moreover, the substrate could avoid the use of noble metals, self-assembled steps, complicated photolithograph treatments, as well as the graphene transferring processes. And the GW-SERS substrate could provide the high SERS activity and eliminate fluorescence background noise. Hence, this GW-SERS substrate could be potentially applied for detecting trace amount of analytes in future analytical detection fields."

786,Effect of cationic and non-ionic surfactants on the microstructure of ambient pressure dried zirconia aerogel,2017-08-01,"Aerogels have superior properties such as low density, large specific surface area and high thermal insulation. Zirconia aerogels have great potential applications particularly in catalysis. Synthesizing zirconia aerogels with high porosities and large specific surface areas, however, is difficult. A surfactant was introduced to the sol to prevent the collapse of the pore structure during the gelation and drying processes. Surfactant-applied zirconia aerogels were synthesized by a sol–gel method via ambient pressure drying. Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was used as a cationic surfactant, and Brij S10 and Pluronic P-123 were used as non-ionic surfactants. All surfactants yielded positive effects in terms of preventing the collapse of the pore structures and enhancing the specific surface areas. The cationic surfactant, CTAB, improved the specific surface area by up to 89%, and this increase is explained in detail by the repulsive forces of surfactant cations. The addition of the surfactants to the zirconia aerogels also resulted in improved thermal stability by which the aerogels had relatively large specific surface areas after annealing. The incorporation of a surfactant during the sol–gel process of the zirconia aerogel prevented the collapse of the pore structure. Through a comparison of surfactant type, it was determined that the cationic surfactant was most effective at preventing pore collapse."

Ion-beam irradiation on large-area PFA films changes their surface wettability from hydrophobic to superhydrophobic, as nano-size pores are gradually formed on their surfaces according to the ion beam density. Following irradiation gold evaporation creates plasmonic characteristics on the nanoporous PFA films. Although gold films normally show hydrophilic properties (contact angle of ∼80°), gold-coated nanoporous PFA films exhibit superhydrophobicity (contact angle of ∼150°), thus resulting in a large-area flexible superhydrophobic plasmonic platform."

795,Effect of -irradiation on electrical transport properties of ZnTe thin films composed of nanostructures,2017-06-01,"In the present paper, we report the synthesis and characterization of ZnTe nanoparticle films. Effects of γ-radiation on structural, optical and electrical properties of ZnTe nanoparticle films have been analyzed and explained on scientific grounds. From X-ray diffraction analysis, it is established that γ-radiation induces the polycrystallinity in amorphous ZnTe nanoparticles, which increases with increase of γ-radiation dose. On the other hand morphological and microstructural analysis suggest that irradiation γ-radiation leading the nanoparticles to grow big in size. Nanorods like structures have also been observed in the sample irradiated with higher dose of γ-radiation. From electrical investigation of as prepared and γ-irradiated ZnTe nanoparticles films, it is confirmed that γ-irradiation drastically affect the electrical properties of ZnTe nanoparticles thin films. On the basis of resistance versus temperature analysis in the range from 300 to 400 K, it has been inferred that the as-prepared sample shows two types of conduction mechanisms within this temperature range. The electrical transport takes place via variable range hopping for the temperature range (300–370 K), whereas the hopping within localized states dominates for the temperature (370–400 K). For the samples exposed to different doses of γ-radiation (25, 50 and 75 kGy), the electrical conduction is via hopping within band tails of localized states. Optical absorption studies suggest a direct band gap of 2.29 eV for as-prepared nanoparticles, which increases to 2.43 eV after γ-irradiation."
796,"Preparation, thermal investigation and detonation properties of -CL-20-based polymer-bonded explosives with high energy and reduced sensitivity",2017-06-01,"ε-CL-20 based PBXs with high energy and reduced sensitivity are prepared and characterized for the first time. Their thermal decomposition behaviour, mechanical sensitivities and detonation properties are studied. Results show that the prepared ε-CL-20 based PBXs have a detonation velocity higher than 9100 m · s–1 and acceptable insensitivity.

797,Effect of polymer binders on safety and detonation properties of -CL-20-based pressed-polymer-bonded explosives,2017-06-01,"This work tried to investigate the influence of several representative polymers on safety, processing, mechanical and detonation properties of ε-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12- hexaazaisowurtzitane (ε-CL-20) based pressed polymer bonded explosives (PBXs), and then find the relationship between them. Thus ε-CL-20 based pressed PBXs coated by six binders respectively were prepared, including cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), F2311, F2641, glycidylazide polymer (GAP), Estane 5703 and Hytemp 4454. Then the surface topography, polymorph stability, impact sensitivity, charge density, detonation velocity and tensile strength of these PBXs were characterized. The results showed that the structures and properties of polymer binders such as function group, deformation property, density and energetic character affected the performance of CL-20 based PBXs greatly. CL-20 based PBXs coated by Estane 5703 and Hytemp 4454 respectively displayed good safety, processing and mechanical properties, but these two polymers markedly decreased the detonation property. CL-20 based PBXs coated by F2311 and F2641 respectively showed high detonation property, but their safety and mechanical properties were poor. GAP was proved to be the optimum binder, which made ε-CL-20 based PBXs display excellent safety, processing, mechanical and detonation properties. Moreover, this study may provide a useful guidance for the formulation design of ε-CL-20 based pressed PBXs."

The surface topography, impact sensitivity, charge density and detonation velocity of CBPPs were characterized. In addition, accelerating rate calorimetry (ARC) was used to determine the thermal stability of CBPPs. The results showed that the addition of BDNPA/F could greatly improve the deformation property, density and energetic character of CAB matrices, and thus could significantly improve the sensitivity, processing and detonation properties of CBPPs. Moreover, the ARC results showed that BDNPA/F had no obvious effect on the thermal stability of CBPPs. When the mass fraction of BDNPA/F in CAB matrices was 0.6, the relative density, density, detonation velocity and initial decomposition temperature of the CBPPs were 98.2%, 1.949 g/cm3, 9210 m/s and 180.4 °C, respectively, indicating superior processing and detonation properties as well as good thermal stability.

Impedance plots have given the enhanced bulk conductivity of the composites than pristine polymer electrolyte, as a function of concentration of CSA doped PANI. Maier's space charge model explains enhancement of dominating ionic conductivity behavior with the addition of dispersed phase polyaniline. The total bulk conductivity peaks to 3.4 × 10–6 Scm–1 at low threshold concentration (3 wt.%) of PANI and then decreases which is explained by percolation threshold model. Wagner's polarization studies confirm the mixed ionic + electronic behavior of composites with the contribution due to electrons/holes as high as 20% to the total conductivity. DTA study gives the variation in the melting temperature of constituents of PEO:NH4ClO4-Polyaniline composite."
800,Towards high-performance transistors and photodetectors with monolayer graphene through modified transfer and lithography process,2017-06-01,"Although there have been plenty of reports about graphene transistors and photodetectors, due to the carbonization of photoresists during Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) process, polymer residue is widely found in graphene devices, which leads to a weak photoresponse and low carrier mobility. On the other hand, doping in ambient conditions also result in mobility deterioration and Dirac point shift in graphene devices. In this paper, a novel lithography process is found to be efficient in alleviating the polymer residue problem. By inserting a diluted Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) interlayer between graphene and photoresists, and using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution for strapping, the photoresponse of pure monolayer graphene can be as large as 220 mA/W at 1 V bias, which is much larger than previous reports. Furthermore, by introducing an ammonia solution process during the graphene transfer process, the maximum hole mobility of the back-gated graphene transistor can be larger than 8500 cm2V–1s–1, with the Dirac point changed to be near zero. More practically, the mobility exhibits a good stability, which remains high after 20 days in ambient condition. This work provides a feasible route for improving the photoresponsivity and carrier mobility of graphene-based photodetectors."

802,"Synthesis and comparative catalytic study of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles promoted MnCO, MnO and MnO for selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols using molecular oxygen",2017-04-01,"Selective oxidation catalysts play an important role in several industrial processes. Efforts towards finding better oxidation catalysts have always been a focus of studies. In this study we report the synthesis of ZnO x  doped MnCO3 [ZnO x (1%)–MnCO3] via a facile co-precipitation method, which upon calcination at different temperatures yields different manganese oxides i.e., [ZnO x (1%)–MnO2] and [ZnO x (1%)–Mn2O3]. A comparative catalytic study was carried out to evaluate the catalytic performance of carbonate and oxides for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. During this study various catalysts were prepared by varying the w/w percentage of ZnO x  and calcination temperature. The catalytic performance in the liquid-phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol with molecular oxygen as the oxidant was examined and the influence of various parameters such as reaction temperature, reaction time and catalyst concentration has been thoroughly investigated. The ZnO x  (%1)–MnCO3 obtained after calcination at 300 °C showed the best catalytic performance and possessed highest surface area which suggests that the calcination temperature and surface area play a crucial role. Typically, an extremely high specific activity of 60 mmol·g–1 · h–1 with complete benzyl alcohol conversion as well as product selectivity of >99% was achieved within very short reaction time (4 min). It was found that ZnO x  nanoparticles also play an important role in enhancing the catalytic activity for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols. A selective conversion of substituted benzyl alcohols and high benzaldehyde selectivity was observed at different reaction times under mild conditions. Additionally, the catalyst was recycled six times without considerable loss of the catalytic performance and the selectivity remained almost unchanged."

The composition, microstructure and properties of the Sep samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), laser particle size analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG). The modification effects were evaluated by contact angle tests, Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and SEM with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), respectively. The friction and wear characteristics of the as-prepared brake composites were tested at different friction temperatures (from 0 to 350 °C) by a constant speed tester. The results showed that the brake composites with organically modified Sep fiber performed better friction and wear properties. These properties of Sep fiber were further compared with that of conventional fibers such as wollastonite and basalt fibers, which displayed the superiority of heat fading resistance. A possible mechanism for modified Sep fibers reinforced brake composites was also proposed."

Plasma cleaning method of substrate provided a better surface for inkjet printing with better adhesion of the ink on substrate surface. Silver nanoparticle based ink has been modified with different concentrations of 0.01%–1% surfactant (Hexadecylamine), among which 0.25% concentration has showed the best results and considerably improved the quality of the printed electrodes. Further the effect of annealing temperature was studied between 100–400 °C. Coarsening of silver nanoparticles has been observed which led to breaking of film at temperatures higher than 300 °C, proving 300 °C to be most suitable annealing temperature. Self-organization technique has been adopted in which a second electrode follows the first electrode by 4.5 μm reproducible gap in result of the creation of hydrophobic boundary around the printed electrodes due to the presence of surfactant (Hexadeclamine) in the ink."
806,Type A and B gelatin as precursors of silica-templated porous carbon with a specified number of nitrogen- and oxygen-containing functionalities,2017-04-01,"Novel mesoporous carbons were synthesized using a hydrogel-based silica templating approach with control of the pH by ammonia buffer and gelatin as a promising carbon precursor. Three types of gelatin were selected: bovine-derived gelatin characterized by isoelectric point (IEP) of 4.5–5.0 and two porcine-derived ones with IEP of 7.0–9.0 and 8.5±0.5, respectively. The physicochemical properties of the obtained carbons were studied by low-temperature adsorption of nitrogen, elemental analysis, thermal analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The role of the IEP of gelatin and the pH of synthesis in the gelatin-silica composite formation was investigated. The gelatin precipitates at the pH close to IEP, leading to lowered porosity of the obtained carbons. The carbon with the highest total pore volume (Vt  = 4.91 cm3/g) was obtained using the composite prepared at a pH, which substantially exceeded the IEP. The nitrogen content for this sample reached 10.9 wt%. This carbon is characterized with a better ability to accumulate charge within the electrical double layer in 1 M H2SO4 and high capacitance retention of 95%. The content of N and O in the composites and carbons could be tuned by controlling the type of gelatin, the pH of synthesis, and the carbonization temperature."

Rice husk treatments were performed by using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and propyl-trimethoxy-silane. Surface energy and adhesion values were estimated by using AFM. The NaOH treatment showed the most compatible adhesion force and work value (45 nN and 238 mJ/m2) to obtain a good interface with the polypropylene matrix. AFM and FTIR investigations revealed that NaOH mostly has a dissolving effect and silane has a coating effect on rice husk surface treatment. Water absorption value of composites was improved by chemical treatment and MAPP coupling agent.

811,Negative-resistance and high-mobility devices based on paper,2017-02-01,"A two-step, low-temperature (75 °C), and aqueous method has been developed for synthesis of polycrystalline Fe2O3, Y2O3 and Bi2O3 on the surface of cellulose fiber paper. Three types of flexible cellulose paper-based electrical devices have been fabricated using this strategy, which show negative resistance effect, leading to negative current with the increase of applied voltages. Such negative resistance effect can be well explained by a theoretical model based on charge shifting velocity. Most importantly, we find that these paper devices show the merits of low threshold voltage and high mobility, where the Fe2O3-based device exhibits the lowest V th of 0.4 V and the highest mobility of 55555 m2V–1s–1. We consider that the existing of the high mobility on these metal oxides based paper devices might be attributed to the formation of impurity band."

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that chelation of these metals with the –NH2/–OH groups from chitosan, –COOH group from carbon nanotubes, and aqua ligands represents a possible structure of the active M2+ species in the Chit-CNT system. The electrochemical behaviors of the Chit-CNT film modified glassy carbon electrode were characterized for individual and simultaneous detection of Cu2+, Cd2+ and Pb2+ in 0.2 M pH 5 acetic buffer solutions by square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry. For individual detection, the concentration range was 0.25–1.24 ppm with a detection limit of 0.1 ppm (R 2 = 0.978) for Cu2+; 1.50–4.44 ppm with a detection limit of 0.8 ppm for Cd2+ (R 2 = 0.975); and 0.63–3.70 ppm with a detection limit of 0.6 ppm for Pb2+ (R 2 = 0.972). For simultaneous detection, the sensitivities of Cd2+ and Pb2+ were enhanced in a Cd2+–Pb2+ mixture system; however, those of Pb2+ and Cu2+ were weakened in a Pb2+–Cu2+ mixture system. Furthermore, application of the lab chip sensor was investigated, and examples of in situ measurement of heavy metals in waste soil were obtained."

The sample libraries as a function of vertical and lateral distance from the sputtering target were synthesized on a single soda-lime glass substrate at the substrate temperature of 500 °C employing a stoichiometric CGS single target. As we increased the vertical distance between the target and substrate, the CGS thin films had more stable and uniform characteristics in structural and chemical properties. Under the optimized conditions of the vertical distance (150 mm), the CGS thin films showed densely packed grains and large grain sizes up to 1 μm in scale with decreasing lateral distances. The composition ratio of Ga/[Cu+Ga] and Se/[Cu+Ga] showed 0.50 and 0.93, respectively, in nearly the same composition as the sputtering target. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the CGS thin films had a pure chalcopyrite phase without any secondary phases such as Cu–Se or ordered vacancy compounds, respectively. In addition, we found that the optical bandgap energies of the CGS thin films are shifted from 1.650 to 1.664 eV with decreasing lateral distance, showing a near-stoichiometric region with chalcopyrite characteristics."

816,A theoretical model for thermal conductivity of nanofluids,2017-02-01,"Nanofluid is modeled as a three-dimensional lattice structure. The model extends the use of Bridgman theoretical equation for the thermal conductivity of pure liquids, in addition to the concept of thermal resistances in parallel and series in heat transfer. The model does not include the thermal conductivity of the nanoparticle material and any fitting parameter; it requires the volume fraction of the nanoparticles and the fluid thermal conductivity in addition to the bulk modulus and density of the nanoparticles material. The results are compared with experimental data for eight different nanoparticle—fluid systems and found to compare favorably in most cases. The model results are also compared with Maxwell model, showing three fourths of the cases in which the present model is in agreement with experimental data versus one half of the cases for Maxwell model. The results seem to support the enhancement ratio mechanism by transfer of energy at the speed of sound of the nanomaterial through consecutive collisions between nanoparticles."

The measured physical parameters like density and molar volume are found to vary linearly and exponentially with increasing Er2O3 content, respectively. X-ray powder diffractrogram show broad peaks which conforms glassy nature of the sample. FTIR spectroscopy reveals the presence of SiO4, ZnO4 and Er–O vibration groups in the glass samples. The optical absorption spectra were measured in the wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm and the optical band gaps were determined.

Several techniques were employed to characterize the HfO2 colloidal nanocrystals. Two excitation peaks one at 316, and other at 366 nm wavelengths were observed in absorption spectrum. Also, a strong blue light wave was emitted by the HfO2 sol. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) demonstrated that the average diameter of HfO2 nanocrystals is about 5 nm.

820,Effect of poisson's ratio on functionally graded cellular structures,2016-12-01,"Poisson's ratio is one of the key parameters of material properties, and it could directly decide deformation and distribution of stress in materials and structures. In this paper, effects of Poisson's ratio on static mechanical behaviours of functionally graded structure are investigated in three different kinds of elastic models. Configurations of unit cell and finite element (FE) models are utilized to analyze macro cellular structures under static compression loads. The properties of graphite sheet structure in micro-nano scaled structures are calculated. The unit cell varies from hexagonal to re-entrant configurations while Poisson's ratio varies from positive to negative values gradually. The combined Fourier series-Galerkin method is introduced to solve beam structure subjected to transverse loads. In the numerical results, it is found that Poisson's ratio exhibits appreciable effects on bearing capacity, which indicates static properties can be improved by optimal design of cell shape material distribution and computational methodology."
821,"Copper-substituted cobalt ferrite nanoparticles: Structural, optical and antibacterial properties",2016-12-01,"Economic and simple co-precipitation technique was used to synthesize cobalt ferrite nanoparticles (Cu x Co(1–  x  )Fe2O4) where x = 0.0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0. We systematically studied the crystal structure and antibacterial properties of samples as a function of Cu-substituted content. Increasing Cu concentration causes decrease in the nanoparticle size from ∼30 to ∼20 nm. Specific saturation magnetization (Ms), remanent magnetization (Mr) and coercivity (Hc) of the spinel ferrites are diminished by the substitutions of Cu+2 ions. FTIR spectra exhibit two prominent fundamental absorption bands at ∼595 cm–1 and 419 cm–1. These bands correspond to intrinsic stretching vibrations of metal at tetrahedral and octahedral site respectively. The Raman scattering results reveal that increase in the Cu content enhances the local disorder at both tetrahedral and octahedral sub lattices. Moreover, we found that substitution of cobalt with copper leads to high reactive oxygen species (ROS) which in turn enhance the antibacterial ability, as exhibited by optical density and inhibition zone diameter (IZD). The results indicate that the substitution of Co with Cu in Co ferrite nanoparticles strongly influences the microstructure, crystal structure and particle diameter."
822,Influence of PZT piezoelectric ceramics on the structure and electric properties of piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate/poly(vinylidene fluoride) composites,2016-12-01,"In the paper, piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate/poly(vinylidene fluoride) composites were prepared by hot pressing method, and influences of changing types, volume fraction and particle size of piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) on the dielectric constant (ε  r ), dielectric loss (tan δ), the piezoelectric strain constant (d 33) and piezoelectric voltage constant (g 33) of this composites were also studied. The results showed that the influence of PZT types on the ε  r  of the composites was not obvious, while (when) the tan δ varied a lot, and when the volume fraction of PZT was larger than 50%, there were larger differences between the composites of the g 33 and d 33. The ε  r , tan δ, d 33 and g 33 of piezoelectric composites increased along with the increase of the volume fraction of the ceramic phase. With the particle size of PZT increased, the ε  r  of composites showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing, and the tan δ decreased at first, then increased and decreased at last. When grain size of ceramic particle was 150∼180 μm, the piezoelectric composite had the best comprehensive performance (ε  r  = 54.48, tan δ = 0.029, d 33 = 17.9 pC/N, g 33 = 37.11 mV · m/N)."
823,Controllable phase structure and mechanical properties of ZrB–NbN nanocomposite films by magnetron co-sputtering,2016-12-01,"ZrB2–NbN nanocomposite films at different powers of ZrB2 were effectively deposited on Si (100) substrate via multi-target magnetron co-sputtering system. The influence of the power of ZrB2 on the phase structures and mechanical properties of the nanocomposite films was investigated. Higher power of ZrB2 led to an increase in the bombarding energy and content of ZrB2. The cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) examinations indicated that different contents of ZrB2 and NbN affected ZrB2 (001) and (002) textures. ZrB2 grew from amorphous to crystalline through whole films as power of ZrB2 increased. During deposition process, NbN kept amorphous. With the power of ZrB2 increasing gradually, the columnar textures of ZrB2 were surrounded by amorphous NbN, which inhibited the growth of grain size and then enhanced the mechanical properties of the nanocomposite films. The maximum elastic modulus and hardness were up to 357.4 GPa and 34.8 GPa at ZrB2 power of 100 W. These results revealed that appropriate ZrB2 power could improve the mechanical properties of ZrB2–NbN nanocomposite films."

The MKR is very sensitive to humidity changes since its refractive index is strongly humidity dependent. As a result, shifts occur in the resonance wavelength and there are also changes in output power. The un-coated MKR showed a sensitivity of 1.3 pm/%RH, in terms of the resonance wavelength, and a sensitivity of 0.0626 dB/%RH for the transmitted output power. The sensitivity increased greatly after the deposition of a porous TiO2 nanoparticle coating on the MKR. The TiO2-coated MKR showed an improved sensitivity of 2.5 pm/%RH, with respect to the resonance wavelength, and 0.0836 dB/%RH for the transmitted output power. This MKR sensor has the potential for use in a variety of humidity sensing applications."
825,Rational design of binder-free Sn film anode for lithium ion batteries,2016-12-01,"Substantial efforts have been made to improve the electrochemical properties of tin-based materials as substitute for traditional graphite anode materials. However, the large volume expansion of metallic tin hampers its development. In this paper, we design a binder-free anode configuration with Sn-carbon based materials ([email protected]/Sn). As-grown carbon spheres, sandwiched between Sn film and Cu grid, were utilized as a buffer layer to cushion the volume expansion occurred in the Sn film during charging and discharging processes. The [email protected]/Sn exhibits excellent capacity retention after 150 cycles with a nearly 100% columbic efficiency. It delivers a specific capacity of 432.6 mAh/g at the 100 mA/g, several times higher than that in the [email protected] anode. Our results reveal that the buffer layer of carbon spheres plays an important role to enhance the electrochemical performance of [email protected]/Sn."
826,Enhanced negative thermal expansion by solid solution of HfMgMoWO,2016-12-01,"HfMgMo3O12 exhibits a low positive thermal expansion and HfMgW3O12 displays a low negative thermal expansion (NTE). It is found that the solid solution of HfMgMo1.5W1.5O12 has an enhanced NTE with lower anisotropy with respect to HfMgMo3O12 and HfMgW3O12. The coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) for HfMgMo1.5W1.5O12 are α  a  = –6.78 × 10–6 K–1, α  b  = 6.59 × 10–6 K–1, α  c  = –5.23 × 10–6 K–1, α  v  = –6.19 × 106– K–1 for the a-, b- and c-axes and volume, respectively. This gives rise to a linear CTE of α  l  = –2.06 × 10–6 K–1. The alternative arrangements of W and Mo around each octahedra and differences in electronegativity and cation radius between W and Mo account probably for the enhanced NTE and decreased anisotropy with respect to HfMgMo3O12."
827,Modification of strain relaxation process by Si doping in metamorphic Al(Ga)InAs layers grown on GaAs,2016-12-01,"We investigated the effects of Si doping on the dislocation movements in the compositionally step-graded Al(Ga)InAs buffers grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on (001) GaAs substrates with 7° miscut toward (111)A. It is found that Si doping suppresses the In segregation and the formation of phase separation in the Al(Ga)InAs buffers to reduce the surface roughness and the threading dislocation density in InP cap layer. In particular, Si substitutes group III atoms as n-type doping for incorporating into B-type step along the [110] direction and the effect of Si incorporation on the movement of β dislocations is obvious, which consequently promotes β dislocations to glide in the interface and reduces the β threading dislocation densities. While Si impurity has a great ability to lock α dislocations on the (111) slip planes and eventually change the tilt in the [110] direction. Since doping is essential for many types of optoelectronic devices, these results are valuable for improving the material properties and performance of metamorphic devices."
828,Influence of low temperature -GaN layer on the optical properties of a GaN-based blue light-emitting diodes,2016-12-01,"The optical properties of two different InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well (MQW) light-emitting diodes (LED), without, and with, a low-temperature (LT) p-GaN layer, were studied by using electroluminescence (EL) methods assisted by photoluminescence (PL) methods. The measurement results show that inserting an LT p-GaN layer between the MQW active region and the p-AlGaN electron block layer (EBL) can prevent the re-evaporation of In in the MQW active region, particularly in the last QW, since the sample with an LT p-GaN layer shows a obvious red-shift of the EL peak and a enhanced localisation effect of the carriers inferred from the more obvious ""S-shaped"" temperature dependent behaviour of the peak energy. Meanwhile, the introduction of the LT p-GaN layer also results in a great increase in the integrated EL intensity and a significant reduction in the efficiency droop. This is mainly attributed to the improvement of the hole injection efficiency and the suppression of the electron leakage. In addition, it may be also related to the enhanced localisation effect, the reduced QCSE, and the improved crystal quality of the MQW active region and p-type region, due to the introduction of the LT p-GaN layer."
829,Efficiency enhancement of GaN-based green light-emitting diode with PN-doped quantum barriers,2016-12-01,"In this work, a GaN-based green light-emitting diode (LED) with PN-doped quantum barriers (PNBs) was proposed to replace conventional LED with undoped barriers (UBs). We investigate the optical and electrical properties of this LED structure by experiments and simulations. According to the experimental results, the light intensity of LED with PNBs increases by 20.2% compared to conventional LED with UBs. The peak wavelength of LED decreases from 521.8 nm to 505.9 nm by replacing UBs with PNBs. The calculated results indicate that the designed PNBs can effectively improve the light power and reduce the capacitance of the GaN-based green LEDs. The efficiency improvement is attributed to improvement of the radiative recombination rate within the active region. The simulation data demonstrate that PNBs can effectively suppress the electric field intensity in the wells and enhance the electron–hole wave function overlap. The capacitance of LED with PNBs decreases by 37% compared to conventional LEDs."

834,Effect of secondary inhibitors on material removal rate and nano-roughness of Cu chemical mechanical planarization,2016-10-01,"We have reported chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) performance aspects of nanoscale colloidal silica based Cu CMP slurries with a focus on the interdependent effect of various slurry ingredients like inhibitor, oxidant, chelating agent, dispersant and stabilizer. The CMP performance was mainly evaluated in terms of material removal rate and nanoscale wafer surface uniformity. The use of heterocyclic organic compounds and non-ionic surfactant—as secondary inhibitors—has been explored in formulating the slurry to enhance the CMP performance. The nanoscale roughness was ascertained by using high resolution atomic force microscopy. It is concluded that the addition of the commercial surfactant Triton X-100 in the slurry plays a key role in realizing high material removal rate outcome (i.e., higher than 6000 Å/min) and fittingly low wafer surface uniformity at nanoscale. The speculative mechanism for the enhanced Cu CMP performance with respect to addition of Triton X-100 has been also proposed by using tools like X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high resolution atomic force microscopy and contact angle measurements."
835,Removal of metal ions from aqueous solution with -cyclodextrin-based hydrogels,2016-10-01,"In this study, a hydrogel SiO2-g-GMA/β-CD-Ac was synthesized by the free-radical cross-linking polymerization of SiO2-g-GMA/β-CD-Ac, it was then used for the adsorption of metal ions from aqueous solutions. The structure and properties of SiO2-g-GMA/β-CD-Ac were characterized by FT-IR and SEM. SEM image shows that SiO2-g-GMA/β-CD-Ac composite particles presented spherical morphology. Strongly depended on the pH of the solution, the maximum adsorption capacity for Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+ and Ni2+ were found to be 110.0, 51.02, 15.20, 11.69 mg/g as the pH was 5.5, respectively. Kinetic studies showed that the adsorption process obeys pseudo-second-order rate mechanism and the intra particle diffusion was not the only rate-limiting step. The equilibrium data were fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm model (R 2 > 0.99), where adsorption was an exothermic and spontaneous process."
836,Comparison studies on the anticorrosion and overall performance of solvent/water based epoxy-copper reinforced composite coatings,2016-10-01,"The influence of using two types of carrier agent namely, water and solvent, on the overall performance of epoxy resin has been investigated. Furthermore, four different loading rates of copper pigments (Cu) have been successfully embedded into two developed polymeric matrices and the changes occurred in the structure, thermal, fouling ability, morphology, and the anticorrosion performance have been studied. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), field immersion test, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to evaluate the formulated coating systems. The results revealed that, the incorporation of Cu pigments did not significantly affect the efficiency of the room temperature curing process and further led to enhancement on the thermal stability of both developed epoxy resins. However, utilizing Cu pigments with solvent based epoxy (SB) showed better antifouling and anticorrosion properties compered to Cu composites prepared with water based epoxy resin (WB). The electrochemical behavior up to 30 days of immersion in 3.5% NaCl solution confirmed that the SB resin loaded with Cu pigments at 10% PVC, SB 10, demonstrated excellent barrier and anticorrosion properties. Neat WB coating (WB 0) was found to have the best performance among all WB coating systems."
837,Electrical conduction and dielectric properties of doped iron/poly(aniline-co-o-anthranilic acid) copolymer and production of magnetite-hematite nanoparticles based on composites as precursor,2016-10-01,"Nano-sized iron oxides face-centered cubic (Fe3O4) and rhombohedral (α-Fe2O3) have been successfully prepared by thermal decomposition of ferric ion doped poly aniline-co-o-anthranilic acid (PANAA). Ferric ion doped PANAA was synthesized by oxidative chemical polymerization of aniline and o-anthranilic acid monomers. Iron oxides have been characterized by XRD and SEM. Nanoparticles size of mixed iron oxides was in the range of 3–6 nm. The XRD analysis revealed a broad pattern of FCC and cubic crystal structure of iron oxide. FTIR, UVVisible spectra measurements and TGA as well as the conductivity of pure copolymer and copolymers/iron(III) composites have been studied."
838,Novel multilayer sandwich-like LiVO nanosheets-graphene composites with hierarchical structure and enhanced oxygen electro-reduction performance,2016-10-01,"In this work, multilayer sandwich-like LiV3O8 nanosheets-graphene (LiV3O8-G) composites were initially developed by a facile solution-based assembly followed by a thermal reduction process using graphene oxide sheets, V2O5 nanobelts and LiOH (aq) as raw materials. The resultant nanocomposites were further determined to be of a unique hierarchical morphology composed of high purity LiV3O8 nanosheets and graphene sheets layerby-layer alternatively. Moreover, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalytic performance of LiV3O8-G nanocomposites was measured by various electrochemical methods in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. It is found that LiV3O8-G based electrodes show increased activity and stability in comparison with the bare LiV3O8 electrode. Combined with the analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results, the enhancement can be ascribed to the enlarged conductivity and plentiful interspace due to the introduction of graphene sheets in the nanocomposites."
839,Fabrication of Bi-2223 superconducting thick films via a non-vacuum method on silver foil substrates,2016-10-01,"In this study, high temperature superconducting (Bi,Pb)2Sr2Ca2Cu3O x  (Bi-2223) films about 8 μm thick were fabricated by using a non-vacuum method. The precursor films was dip-coated on silver foil substrates and heat-treated. To prevent the evaporation of Bi and Pb at high temperatures, a ""powder-in-foil"" method was used. The heat treatment consisted of two steps with an intermediate pressing process, similar to the powder-in-tube (PIT) technique for Bi-2223/Ag superconducting tapes. The optimized samples showed a critical current density of about 29 kA/cm2 (77 K, self-field), which was comparable to that of commercial PIT Bi-2223/Ag tapes. This study provided an efficient new method to fabricate Bi-2223 long wires capable to carry considerable superconducting current."
840,Facile preparation of ZnO nanorods/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites with photocatalytic property,2016-10-01,"The ZnO nanorods/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites were prepared by using the graphene oxide sheets, zinc acetate, and hexamethylenetetramine as precursors through a facile and green hydrothermal reaction process of 200 °C. In the resulting nanocomposites, the graphene oxide sheets were reduced to the reduced graphene oxide sheets, and the ZnO nanorods with a diameter of 100–200 nm and a length of 1–2 μm were in-situ formed and uniformly distributed over the surfaces of the reduced graphene oxide sheets, which can effectively prevent the reduced graphene oxide sheets from the π–π stacking. Interestingly, as photocatalysts, the resulting nanocomposites exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity on methylene blue under UV illumination, due to the synergetic effects of well dispersed ZnO nanorods and no stack reduced graphene oxide sheets bonded among the ZnO nanorods."
841,Preparation of dry grinding diamond wheel with novel thermal conductivity based on resin-Cu composite matrix,2016-10-01,"Resin-based dry grinding wheels not only require the resin matrix to possess high thermostability, but also need to have good heat dissipation capability. In this paper, copper fibers with high thermal conductivity were introduced to fabricate resin-based composite diamond wheel. Experimental results show that the copper fibers form three-dimensional heat dissipation network which can transfer grinding heat from machining interface to wheel body rapidly and reduce the thermal cumulation effectively. The dry grinding effect of resin-Cuf based diamond wheels was improved significantly by adding high thermally conductive copper fibers. When 15 wt% copper fibers were added to the resin-based matrix, the hardness value of the dry grinding diamond wheel reached 56 HRB, and the thermal conductivity of the dry grinding diamond wheel was improved to 15.14 W/mK, which is about 10.3 times of that without Cuf. The service life of the dry grinding diamond wheel was increased by 50%."
842,Transparent and conductive multi-functional window layer for thin-emitter Si solar cells,2016-10-01,"Optically transparent and electrically conductive multi-functional window layer was applied for Si solar cells. A thin indium-tin-oxide (ITO) has a high optical transparency of 89.1% and was coated on pyramidal-shaped Si to provide significantly suppressed reflection at surface. This ITO-window serves as an electrical conducting layer (55.2 ω/ ) on Si, which relives the high-doping requirement for an emitter layer. We applied the transparent ITO electrical conducting layer for Si solar cells with modulation of thickness of Si emitter. A thin-emitter has benefits to locate a space charge region close to the Si surface to render a shorter transport length of photogenerated carriers, resulting in higher collection efficiency, compared to those of thick-emitter. ITO-windowed thin-emitter provided a relatively high current density value of 34.34 mA/cm2, which is 32%-enhanced value from 25.92 mA/cm2 of the thick-emitter. We demonstrate a functional design of transparent conductor-embedding Si solar cells and suggest a route for further improvement."
843,Gamma-ray shielding performance of carbon nanotube film material,2016-10-01,"This paper aims to explore the shielding potential of light-weight carbon nanotube (CNT) film materials against gamma-ray generated from americium-241 (241Am) and caesium-137 (137Cs). The influence factors of gamma mass attenuation coefficient of CNT film laminates were investigated to reveal structure-property relationship. The results showed that CNT film materials had bigger mass attenuation coefficients than carbon fiber reinforced composites, suggesting stronger radiation interaction induced by CNT's cylindrical nanostructure. CNT alignment was proved to be conducive to the improvement of mass attenuation coefficient and gamma attenuation ratio. Aligned CNT film laminate with the thickness of 10 mm had a mass attenuation coefficient of 0.086 cm2 /g and attenuation ratio of 4.9% against gamma-ray exposed to 137Cs, which were higher than those of aluminum, iron or copper sheets. CNT film material demonstrated its potential for the application of light-weight gamma-ray safety equipment and devices."
844,Industrially feasible NbSi-ITO-based mid-to-high temperature solar-selective absorbing coating with favorable optical property and thermal stability,2016-08-01,"Nb5Si3, Nb5Si3-ITO, and Si3N4 layers are all deposited by magnetron sputtering technique on Al to obtain Nb5Si3-ITO-based solar selective coating. The structure, composition, and morphology of the Nb5Si3-ITO core layer have been studied by the means of X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electronic microscopy. The solar absorptance (α) and thermal emittance (ε) of the solar selective coating have been investigated by UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometry. The solar absorptance of Al/Nb5Si3/Nb5Si3-ITO/Si3N4 coating with 15 at.% ITO in Nb5Si3-ITO layer is 88.98% as deposited and 85.78% after annealed at 500 °C for 40 h in air. To further improve its solar absorptance and thermal stability, metal Mo deposited on stainless steel substrate is introduced as an IR-reflective metallic layer beneath the Nb5Si3/Nb5Si3-ITO/Si3N4 layers. Eventually, the SS/Mo/Nb5Si3/Nb5Si3-ITO/Si3N4 coating exhibits solar absorptance of 93.06% and thermal emittance of 8.8% as deposited and the optical performance remains nearly the same after annealed at 500 °C for 120 h in air. This technique has been successfully transferred to industrial application. In addition, the optical performance and thermal stability of the SS/Mo/Nb5Si3/Nb5Si3-ITO/Si3N4 solar selective absorbing coating have been certified by Solartechnik Prüfung Forschung."

In this paper, a series of silicate phosphors compounds Ba2Gd2–x Y x Si4O13: Eu2+ (x = 0 to 1) have been synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction. The crystal structure of Ba2Gd2–x Y x Si4O13: Eu2+ was confirmed by the Rietveld refinements, demonstrating the sample is Ba2Gd2–x Y x Si4O13: Eu2+ solid solution. With increasing Y3+ concentration, the emission peak of Ba2Gd2–x Y x Si4O13: Eu2+ gradually shifts from 505 to 494 nm (blue-shift). The temperature-dependent photoluminescence properties of Ba2Gd2–x Y x Si4O13: Eu2+ phosphors are measured and that of the Ba2Gd2Si4O13: Eu2+ is the best in all the samples. This investigation reveals a simple linear correlation of Y3+ content and chromaticity coordinate. All the results indicate that Ba2Gd2Si4O13: Eu2+ is a more potential application for white light LEDs than other."
846,Segmentation of ground glass opacity pulmonary nodules using an integrated active contour model with wavelet energy-based adaptive local energy and posterior probability-based speed function,2016-08-01,"Ground-glass opacity (GGO) pulmonary nodules in computerized tomography (CT) images are potential manifestations of lung cancer, which are more likely to be malignant. Segmentation of potential nodule objects is the first necessary step in computer-aided detection system of pulmonary nodules. Due to the fuzzy boundary and intensity inhomogeneity of GGO pulmonary nodules, it is hard to accurately segment them using traditional active contour models. This paper studies a method to accurately segment GGO nodules. A novel segmentation method using the integrated active contour model with wavelet energy-based adaptive local energy and posterior probability-based speed function, is proposed in this paper. Our approach has several novel aspects: (1) multi-features including the wavelet energy and texture feature are incorporated into the integrated active contour model. (2) the local domain for local energy model is selected adaptively based on k-nearest-neighbour (KNN) estimate method. (3) the posterior probability-based speed function of evolution is used. As-proposed method has been validated on a clinical dataset of 102 chest CT scans that contain 23 GGO nodules determined by a ground truth reading process, and evaluating the algorithm on the provided data leads to an average true positive ratio (TP), false positive ratio (FP) and the similarity (SI) of 85.02%, 18.42% and 84.67%, respectively. Results demonstrate that our proposed model can accurately segment part solid and nonsolid GGO nodules."
847,Creep analysis of concrete with different mineral admixtures,2016-08-01,"In order to comprehensively master the effect of different mineral admixtures on the creep behavior of concrete, the mechanical properties and creep of concrete with active mineral admixtures (i.e., fly ash (FA), ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS), metakaolin (MK)) and inert mineral admixtures (i.e., limestone powder (LP), quartz sand powder (QSP) and emery powder (EP)) were studied by using a self-made testing device. The corresponding effect mechanism was also analyzed according to the internal relative humidity (IRH) and pore microstructure organization of the mixed concrete. The results show that the use of FA and/or GGBS can reduce the creep of concrete, and more creep can be reduced if both MK and inert mineral admixtures are used, although different mineral admixtures have different effects on the compressive strength and elastic modulus of the mixed concrete. The correlation between specific creep and IRH can be characterized in three different zones. The combined use of FA and GGBS can reduce the pore volume of pores of different sizes, and the concrete mixes with MK and inert mineral admixtures have very similar pore size distribution to provide more resistance to their creep."
848,Thermal characteristics of chitosan dispersed poly lactic acid/basalt hybrid composites,2016-08-01,"This paper focuses on reinforcing poly lactic acid with chitosan nano particles and silane treated basalt fiber. poly lactic acid (PLA) composites with different weight percentage of chitosan (CS) and basalt fiber (BF) were intermixed under high pressure and shear deformation by solid-state reactive blending in twin screw extruder and injection moulding technique. Low glass transition temperatures are maintained throughout the process (below the melting points of the crystalline polymers) to minimizing oxidative degradation of the polymer and fiber. The thermal properties of injected molded composites were extensively examined by differential scanning Calorimetry, thermo gravimetric analysis, and dynamic mechanical analysis. It was found that the increased weight percentage of basalt fibers and chitosan nano particles are very effective in reinforcing poly lactic acid. It is demonstrated in this paper basalt fiber and chitosan were to be will incorporated and uniformly distributed using Scanning electron microscopy. The optimum weight percentage of basalt fiber and chitosan in poly lactic acid composites was found to be 25 wt% and 10 wt% respectively."
849,Characterization and quantification of pH sensitive polymers used in drug targeting by inverse-phase gas chromatography and dynamic vapour sorption techniques,2016-08-01,"Surface energies and dynamic vapour sorption (DVS) plays an imperative role in drug polymer interaction in the formulation development for a number of applications. Powdered films of two pH sensitive polymers namely hypromellose phthalate (HPMCP) and methacrylic acid copolymer NF (Eudragit L30-55) were studied for surface energy analysis employing inverse-phase gas chromatography (IGC) which is a well-known physical technique in acquiring significant information about surfaces of pharmaceutical powder or film. The mean surface energies of Eudragit L30D-55 and HPMCP films were found to be 40.48 mJ/m2 and 55.03 mJ/m2 respectively and significantly different from each other. Due to this difference, tablets were coated separately with HPMC and Eudragit L30D-55 in equal amount and were subjected to Near-Infra Red FTIR (NIR) equipped with DVS analyser for measuring DVS changes versus relative humidity (RH) in both coated tablets. Initial NIR and changing RH (25–75% up to 90%) of coated tablets were recorded after 15 minutes throughout the experiment. Eudragit L30-55 coated tablets showed no changes in NIR up to 90% of RH. However, HPMCP showed significant changes in NIR at 90% RH, indicating interaction of moisture with drug due to greater surface energy of HPMCP compared to Eudragit. These results confirmed good correlation between surface energy and relative humidity of two polymeric films and coated tablets. The study also shows quantification of drug and polymer by in vitro release of phthalyl group."
850,"Controllable synthesis, characterization and lithium ion battery performance of LiFePO nanosheets",2016-08-01,"Olivine LiFePO4 nanosheets were controllably synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method, followed by a post-annealing process. The synthesized nanomaterials were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results indicate that the addition of triethylene glycol (TEG) in the solvent has great influence on the particle morphology. By adjusting the volume ratio of water and TEG in reaction system, different LiFePO4 nanocrystalline including nanorods, nanosheets, nanobelts and laminars could be synthesized controllably. Dispersive and thin LiFePO4 nanosheets were obtained in the solvent with the water/TEG volume ratio of 1:1, the average thickness of the nanosheets is about 50 nm, and its up and bottom planes are (±100). The Li ion battery performance of synthesized LiFePO4 nanomaterials were measured, the LiFePO4 nanosheets show good electrochemical property. At a rate of 0.2 C, its initial discharge specific capacity can reach 153.8 mAhg–1 at room temperature, and the capacity retention can reach 87.6% after 150 cycles. As a comparison, the relative discharge specific capacity and capacity retention of LiFePO4 nanorods synthesized in the pure water are only 125.9 mAhg–1 and 81.7%, respectively."
851,Degradation of Cr5 backup roll material under rolling contact fatigue,2016-08-01,"Progressive degradation and microstructural changes of Cr5 backup roll material with rolling contact fatigue cycles was investigated. Changes in the hardness and micro-structure of the tested samples were characterized using micro-indentation, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Tests performed on the samples at different intervals followed by mechanical and microscopically method lead to the conclusion that hardening mechanism is accumulation and extension of dislocations with accumulation of fatigue damage, followed by progress fracture of large bainite and martensite laths that even lead to the formation of nanocrystallites. Huge densities of interfaces were introduced by formation of nanocrystallites. Interfaces decohesion of nanocrystallites and diffusion of dislocation motions under cyclic stress allows formation and joint of micro-cracks along the nanocrystallites' interfaces, and ultimately cracks. The formation of nanocrystallites that cannot act as barriers to crack propagation and the diffusion effect of dislocation motions in the process of fatigue accumulation were responsible for the progressive degradation of Cr5 backup roll materials."
852,Fabrication of aluminum nanowires by mechanical deformation of Al using anodic porous alumina molds,2016-08-01,"The fabrication of Al nanowires by the mechanical deformation of Al using anodic porous alumina molds is reported. Al was pressed into the fine pores of an anodic porous alumina, and then Al nanowires were obtained by dissolving the alumina mold. Also, by detaching the alumina mold, Al nanowires with a low aspect ratio could be obtained. The detached alumina mold could be repeatedly used for the formation of nanowires. In addition, the formation of a nanoporous oxide layer on the Al nanowires was carried out. The obtained nanostructures are expected to be applied in various fields requiring materials with a large surface area."
853,Influence of growth temperature on intrinsic stress distribution in aluminum nitride grown by hydride vapor phase epitaxy,2016-08-01,"Controlling stress is a fundamental issue in thin film growth, and this problem becomes more complicated in AlN film growth due to low mobility of Al adatoms. To study the evolution of intrinsic stress distribution in the beginning of growth as a function of growth temperature, AlN films were grown directly on sapphire (0001) substrates at three different growth temperatures by hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated that the intrinsic stress distribution is periodic and the period increases with the increase of temperature. At lower growth temperature, the intrinsic stresses overlap with the dislocations during the initial growth, appearing as periodic nano-sized columns perpendicular to the AlN/sapphire interface when the sample is viewed with g = 112¯0. In addition, the period is different along [11¯00] and [112¯0] for a certain temperature. With the increase of growth temperature, a large fraction of misfit dislocations bend and terminate at around 1.5 μm above the interface of AlN/sapphire forming a network. The periodicity of the stress distribution is thought to originate due to different mobilities of Al adatoms. This understanding helps to achieve stress-controllable AlN growth."
854,Preparation and properties of polyurethane-organic silicone copolymerized electronic packaging materials,2016-08-01,"A novel electronic packaging material made of polyurethane-organic silicone copolymer was prepared by using hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) and α,ω-dihydroxy polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as soft segments, and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) as hard segments. The correlation between the structure and properties of the electronic packaging material was studied with a series of samples prepared by different mass ratios of HTPB and PDMS. Several techniques, including FTIR, DSC, XRD, TG, and mechanical testing, were employed to characterize the structure and properties, including micro-phase separation, thermal stability, and mechanical property of the products. It was found that the micro-phase separation between the soft segments and the hard segments was related to the mechanical properties, adhesive properties, and the thermal stability of the copolymer. The preparation conditions were further investigated to obtain electronic packaging materials with ideal properties. The electronic packaging adhesive with optimum properties was achieved under the preparation condition of PDMS mass content of 5%–7%."
855,Decay of electron conduction zone length by preheating in laser-produced plasma,2016-08-01,"An analytical model was built, considering preheating effect to solve the steady state flow in electron conduction zone of gold plasma. The results show that with low density gold plasma, there is great preheating to the shock wave zone by electron thermal flux from the electron conduction zone, because of the large electron mean free path. The electron conduction zone length decays when the gold density decreases, and almost vanishes with the gold density below 1 g/cm3. Experiments with gold and gold foam targets were performed on high energy laser facility. Additionally, relative numerical simulations were calculated with hydrodynamics code. The experimental, numerical and analytical data are in good agreement."
856,Ag/ZnO/graphene-tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride hybrid nanocomposite as highly efficient catalyst for hydrogen production,2016-06-01,"Modification of Ag/ZnO/graphene nanocomposite using tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) as a precursor of the silicon substrate to produce a highly active catalytic system under visible light for hydrogen photoproduction is created in this work. The catalytic activity of this photoresponsive nanocatalyst towards methylene blue dye degradation and hydrogen production are in detail described. The rate order of methylene blue dye photodegradation and hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation of the samples is: Ag/ZnO/graphene-TBSCl > Ag/ZnO/graphene > Ag/ZnO > ZnO/graphene > ZnO. The hydrogen evolution rate of Ag/ZnO/graphene/TBSCl-hybrid is about 45 times, 6.6 times, 6.4 times and 2.5 times faster than that of pure ZnO nanoparticles, ZnO/graphene, Ag/ZnO and Ag/ZnO/graphene composite, respectively.

This is a new advance in the enhancement of photocatalytic activity of nanostructures and offer additional knowledge in the control of charge recombination."
857,"Synthesis of adamantane-containing methacrylate polymers: Characterization of thermal, mechanical, dielectric and optical properties",2016-06-01,"Radical-initiated polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer has been applied to prepare poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) composites because it is insensitive to water, air, and other impurities. Adamantane-containing methacrylate polymers based on 1-adamantyl methacrylate (ADMA) and MMA were synthesized by free radical copolymerization reactions, and their chemical structures were confirmed using FTIR, 1H NMR and GPC measurements. The thermal, mechanical, dielectric and optical properties of homopolymer PADMA and copolymer P(ADMA-co-MMA) were studied and compared with those of PMMA. Introduction of the adamantane group into the chain of the methacrylate polymer resulted in improvements in the thermal and mechanical properties. These results can be explained in terms of the tricyclic hydrocarbon of the adamantane in a diamond lattice structure and the movement of polymer chains being limited by chair-form cyclohexane rings. The transparency in the UV-visible region (>95%) and the refractive indexes (1.51–1.52) of adamantane-containing methacrylate polymers are higher than those of PMMA, while the water absorption and dielectric constant are lower than those of PMMA. These characteristics of adamantane-containing methacrylate polymers could be due to the bulky, rigid and thermally-stable molecular structure of adamantane."
858,Enhanced plasmonic absorber based on a hexagonal annular nano-array and impact of imperfection,2016-06-01,"In this paper, we introduce and investigate the characteristics of a new metamaterial perfect absorber (MPA) consisting of a metal-dielectric-metal (MDM) functional stack having a gold hexagonal annular nano-array as a top layer. With finite difference time domain (FDTD) method, we investigate the optical absorption spectra of such structures. Evaluation techniques such as average absorption efficiency, ripples percentage, and relative absorption bandwidth are studied. We found that, the out of phase interaction coupling between the localized and propagating surface plasmons can be tuned to boost the performance of the broadband MPA. The proposed MPA exhibits an average absorption efficiency of 97.5% with 4.5% ripples percentage in the visible regime 400–700 nm. The magnetic and electric fields, polarization, current density, and heat absorption distributions are introduced for the proposed MPA. These distributions provide a better insight to the absorption behavior based on both macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. By extension, a honeycomb structure was presented as an imperfection from the hexagonal one to emphasize localized and propagating surface plasmons interaction rule."
859,Positron and positronium studies on Cr-doped lithium aluminum silicate glass,2016-06-01,"The microstructural evolution of the free volume in lithium aluminum silicate glass systems doped with chromium ion is monitored by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. Other different techniques such as X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy are used. The positron lifetime data are explained in terms of the different oxidation states adopted by the chromium ions into the glass network. Once chromium oxide exceeds 0.2 g, a gradual conversion of chromium ions from Cr 6+ state to Cr3+ state exists. The Cr3+ ions in such case are acting as modifiers and greatly favor the formation of non-bridging oxygen's atoms. With increasing the Cr2O3 content the intensity l 3, corresponding to ortho-positronium, was found to decrease sharply. It was speculated that e+, like o-Ps, undergoes localization at empty sites of the, static or dynamic, disordered structure. The free volume size distribution (holes of subnanometer size), its mean value, 〈v h〉, and dispersion,σ h, were calculated from the o-Ps lifetimes. The free volume size v(τ 3) , varied between 24 Å3 and 35.3 Å3, and showed a systematic increase with increasing Cr2O3 content. The apparent fractional free volumes were calculated according to free volume cavity size and intensity of o-Ps."
860,Multi dual-wavelength generation using InGaAsP/InP passive microring resonator with two sides apodized gratings,2016-06-01,"Generation of dual-wavelength using passive semiconductor microring resonator with two sections of apodized grating with total length of 26 μm on the right and left sides is presented here. In this research we use the time-domain travelling wave (TDTW) method to model and simulate the microring resonator made of InGaAsP/InP waveguide. Microring resonator based optical mirrors and band-limited reflectors have been the subject of intense investigations in recent years. Therefore, we propose the microring resonator made of InGaAsP/InP waveguide having two sides grating section. The grating sections have a trapezoidal profile. The gratings provide the means to suppress repetition of the reflection spectrum at every free spectral range (FSR) removed from the design wavelength. The total grating length is 26 μm (each grating side has length of 13 μm), where the total circumference of the microring resonator is 526 μm. Propagation of the input Gaussian pulse (with 10 mW power and bandwidth of 0.76 ps) within the grating sections is presented, where it shows a good confinement of the propagation within the waveguide. As a result, multiple dual-wavelengths with tunable spacing within a range of 127 pm (15.8 GHz) and 237 pm (29.6 GHz) could be generated at the throughput port of the microring resonator. The dispersion of the grating section versus the total grating length and the frequency response of the throughput port output signals are presented. The generated dual-wavelength has many applications in optical sensing, radio frequency (RF) radiation, optical communication, optical switching, millimetre wave generators and biological research."
861,Effect of ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide on ionic conductivity of poly(ethyl methacrylate) based polymer electrolytes,2016-06-01,"Polymer electrolyte films comprising poly(ethyl methacrylate) (PEMA) as host, Magnesium Triflate [Mg(CF3SO3)2 or MgTf] as salt and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (BmImBr) as the ionic liquid are prepared. Upon addition of BmImBr, the ionic conductivity shows a perceptible increase. Highest ionic conductivity of (1.80±0.01)×10–4 S cm–1 is obtained for the polymer electrolyte with 40 wt% ionic liquid at ambient temperature. Temperature dependent ionic conductivity studies are performed to elucidate the mechanism of ion transport and it is found that the system obeys the Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher (VTF) mechanism. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) is carried out to investigate the glass transition temperature (T g) and as expected, ionic liquid added polymer electrolytes exhibit lower glass transition temperature (T g), than ionic liquid-free polymer electrolyte, proving the amorphous nature of the ionic liquid added polymer electrolyte. The sample with the highest ionic conductivity is used to fabricate Electrical Double Layer Capacitors (EDLC). Cyclic Voltammetry analysis shows that specific capacitance of the ionic liquid added polymer electrolyte is found to be higher than the polymer electrolyte without ionic liquid, which proves the plasticizing effect of ionic liquid on the polymer electrolyte."
862,Effect of sodium additive on electrochemical properties of LiNi MnO for high-power lithium-ion batteries,2016-06-01,"Li1–x NaxNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (X = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08) cathode materials have been synthesized via hydroxide co-precipitation method followed by a solid state reaction. The elementary composition, crystal structure features and electrochemical properties of the powder are studied in detail using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), X-ray diffraction (XRD), galvanostatic charge–discharge test and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). The results showed Na addition played an important role in the good cycling performance of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4. Charge/discharge tests revealed that the 6% Na-added sample showed a capacity retention of 94.1% at 1 C after 50 cycles in a high cutoff voltage range (3.5–4.8 V), while discharge capacity of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 remains only 80.2% of that at 1 C. Ex-situ XRD analysis and EIS analysis indicated that the improved electrochemical properties of Na-added sample result from the more stable structure and lower resistance during the electrochemical cycling."

We fabricated and examined our devices under different conditions. It is seen that by choosing proper channel shape, ionization rate and breakdown voltage could be improved compared to normal rectangular device. We report nearly 11% and 19% improvements in breakdown voltage and ionization rate of graphene nanoribbon field effect transistors (GNRFET) respectively. At the end, in order to verify the experimental results using a proposed Monte Carlo simulation approach."
864,"Processing, microstructure and properties of hierarchically porous Cu",2016-06-01,"Hierarchically porous Cu with controlled pore characteristics and mechanical properties were fabricated from CuO powders and NaCl as template. NaCl particles were removed by dissolution from the pre-sintered CuO pellet using deionized water. CuO was decomposed to Cu during sintering at 900 °C in vacuum and resulted in porous Cu with bimodal pores. The porosity of porous Cu increased with increased NaCl content in the initial CuO pellet. The compression strength tests suggested that highly porous Cu were suitable for high impact energy absorption applications. Moreover, porosity, pore size and shape and mechanical properties of porous Cu could be tailored by tailoring the morphology and volume fraction of NaCl particles in the initial CuO pellet."
865,Enhanced breakdown strength and suppressed leakage current of polyvinylidene fluoride nanocomposites by two-dimensional ZrO nanosheets,2016-06-01,"Ultra-thin ZrO2 nanosheets are exfoliated from ZrClO2 · 8H2O powders through a fairly simplified process, and employed as nanofillers to fabricate poly(vinylidene fluoride)/ZrO2 nanocomposites films. Correlation between dielectric breakdown and energy storage properties of nanocomposites films was studied, which shows only 1 wt% incorporation of ZrO2 nanosheets leads to a much improved breakdown strength of 519 kV/mm, and hence consequently give rise to a high energy density of 11.03 J/cm3 with efficiency of 67.4% in PVDF/ZrO2 nanocomposites, much higher than pristine PVDF (8.18 J/cm3 at E b of 416 kV/mm). In order to explore the origin of high breakdown strength, insulating and mechanical properties of nanocomposites are tested, according to which, both reduced leakage current and increased Young's modulus can give explanation for enhanced E b."
866,A new approach to study carrier generation in graphene nanoribbons under lateral bias,2016-06-01,"This paper presents a new approach to study the effect of carrier generation on the current of graphene nanoribbon field effect transistors, which is normally ignored in current–voltage (I–V) modelling. Two analytical models together with a Monte Carlo approach including the edge effect scattering are used to calculate the current and net generation rate respectively. In addition, two fabricated devices with gate lengths of 20 and 30 nm are employed for verification. We showed that ignoring this effect in the modelling, results in error up to 10% for a typical 30 nm graphene field effect transistor. This approach is useful in modelling and optimization of graphene-based field effect transistors and photo sensors."
867,Electro-optical performance of molybdenum oxide modified aluminum doped zinc oxide anodes in organic light emitting diodes: A comparison to indium tin oxide,2016-06-01,"Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been extensively researched for applications in solid state lighting and emissive flat panel displays. Along with improved device lifetime and efficiency, significant cost reductions are required for OLED technology to find widespread use. The transparent conducting oxide (TCO) anode, specifically indium tin oxide (ITO), is a significant contributor to device cost. Low cost alternatives to ITO such as aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) are therefore of technological interest. Basic bilayer OLEDs employing AZO surface modified with approximately 3 nm of molybdenum sub-oxide (MoO x ) anodes (AZO/3 nm MoO x ) exhibited peak luminance (L), power efficiency (PE), luminous efficiency (LE), and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8959 Cd/m2, 3.3 lm/W, 4.1 Cd/A, and 1.4%, respectively. The corresponding values for devices with standard ITO anodes were 8080 Cd/m2, 2.9 lm/W, 3.1 Cd/A, and 1.0%, respectively. In all devices studied, tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum (AlQ3) was the emissive and electron-transport layer, and N,N'-bis(naphthalene-1-yl)– N,N'-bis(phenyl)-benzidine (NPB) was the hole transport layer. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements revealed an effective workfunction of 4.8 eV for the composite AZO/MoO x  anode, compared to 4.6 eV for ITO. Further, UPS of the MoO x  revealed the presence of a defect band below the fermi level, which is due to the filling of Mo 4d states, and indicates the presence of Mo4+, Mo5+ and compensating oxygen vacancies. These donor-like gap states in MoO x  lower the hole injection barrier from AZO, which in turn reduces the turn-on voltage compared to as-deposited AZO (i.e., neat AZO). The improved device performance compared to ITO is ascribed to better charge balance."
868,Chemical characterization and optical properties of SiON films deposited on common glass substrate,2016-06-01,"SiO x N y  films have been widely studied due to their physicochemical properties, which have allowed them to be used in microelectronics, as an alternative for silicon dioxide and silicon nitride as a dielectric layer, with the advantages of low leakage currents, and in optical components such as graded index fibers and antireflection coatings, due to the fact that the films exhibit refractive indices between 1.5 and 2.0 and high visible light transparency. In the present paper, we deposited SiO x N y  thin films from a Si3N4 target via RF magnetron sputtering technique varying the power supply to the target in order to characterize the chemical composition and relate it to the optical response of the films. Structural analysis was carried out through X-ray diffraction (XRD), stoichiometry of the phase composition was obtained through Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS), and the optical response was evaluated via transmittance measurements. The Swanepoel method was used to calculate the refractive index and the average thickness of the films. Additionally, the energy bandgap was determined using the Tauc method. The results show the possibility of obtaining a chemical composition of SiON in the films via sputtering. XRD analysis showed that all the films were amorphous, RBS results indicated that the films are composed of one phase of a Si–O–N network, and optics measurements revealed that between 750 and 1100 nm there is an average transmittance of about 83%. In addition, the energy bandgap was 3.22 eV for the films deposited at 300 W with a stoichiometry: Si = 34.4 at.%, N = 33.0 at.%, and O = 32.6 at.%. These results could be important for optical applications such as designing efficient light emitting devices."
869,Fabrication of superhydrophobic surface with superior anticorrosion and great mechanical stability on AA7075 Al alloy via a convenient and efficient approach,2016-04-01,"Through a facile, low-cost and convenient method called laser marking, myriad micro-orifices with papillae around are successfully constructed in the large scale on Al alloy. Through adjusting the processing parameters (laser process textures spacing and laser scanning speed), the surface morphology is accurately manipulated. Micro-orifices array can be realized on the surface. The results indicate that the fabricated robust surface with micro-orifices array shows excellent superhydrophobicity after fluoration. The static contact angle of the surface can be as high as 156.4°. Moreover, the superhydrophobic surface offers a superior and stable anticorrosion protection to Al alloy in various corrosive environments. More importantly, the as-prepared surface is able to maintain the superhydrophobicity after abrasion test (800 grit SiC sandpaper, abrasion length of 3.0 m, applied pressure of 3000 Pa). The surface shows great abrasion resistance and mechanical stability, which has high practical application value that most of reported superhydrophobic surfaces hardly match. The laser marking treatment provides a simple, low-cost and efficient method satisfying with engineering applications to fabricate large-area robust superhydrophobicity surface on varieties of metallic materials."
870,Investigation of dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles for cytosine-phosphate-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotide delivery,2016-04-01,"Dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) with average particle sizes of 97, 205, and 535 nm have been synthesized to deliver cytosine-phosphate-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs). DMSNs with center-radial pore channels were modified with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) to produce DMSN97-NH2, DMSN205-NH2 and DMSN535-NH2 nanoparticles. CpG ODNs were bonded to the aminated nanoparticles to form DMSN97-NH2/CpG, DMSN205-NH2/CpG and DMSN535-NH2/CpG complexes. For each complex, serum stability, in vitro cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) induction were investigated. All aminated DMSNs had no cytotoxicity to Raw 264.7 cells and enhanced the serum stability of CpG ODNs. The DMSN97-NH2/CpG, DMSN205-NH2/CpG, and DMSN535-NH2/CpG complexes were taken up by cells and were located in endolysosomes, which is beneficial for interactions with Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). Based on a cytokine induction assay, all of the complexes significantly enhanced IL-6 induction compared to free CpG ODNs, but the DMSN97-NH2/CpG complexes exhibited the highest IL-6 induction ability. Therefore, DMSNs with small particle sizes are particularly promising for CpG ODN delivery."
871,Electrophoretic deposition of sol–gel coating comprising alumina and boehmite for organic–inorganic hybrid film,2016-04-01,"Organic–inorganic hybrid films were prepared by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) with plate-shaped alumina particles dispersed in a sol–gel binder, which is prepared by the hydrolysis and condensation reaction of methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) in the presence of colloidal boehmite. A layered orientation of the hybrid films was prepared as an crack-free dense films in which plate shaped alumina particles are uniformly distributed in the sol–gel binder. The microstructure and the electrical and thermal properties of the hybrid films were compared for various operating conditions of the EPD process, such as deposition time and slurry composition. The hybrid films were prepared by EPD of the sol–gel binder with 10–30 wt% plate alumina particles at an applied voltage of 10 V for 1–10 min. The EPD coatings with an increasing coating thickness exhibited a higher electrical insulation. The coating of alumina and boehmite allows higher electric insulation than that of alumina and silica in the same thickness condition. The breakdown voltage was observed to be as high as over 6 kV for a thickness of 110 μm when the colloidal boehmite was used to prepare sol–gel binder, which was achieved from boehmite sol gel binder with 10 wt% Al2O3 by EPD at applied voltage of 10 V for 10 min with condition of a distance of 2 cm between electrodes."
872,Photocatalytic degradation of remazol brilliant orange 3R using wet-chemically prepared CdO-ZnO nanofibers for environmental remediation,2016-04-01,"Remazol Brilliant Orange 3R (Reactive Orange 16, O16) dyes present environmental concerns since they are persistent organics, which are difficult to remove with conventional treatment processes. CdO-ZnO nanofibers doped material was used as a heterogeneous photo-catalyst for degradation of high concentrations of reactive O16 dyes (70.9%), which has remarkable active surface area. The expected mechanism of the photo-decomposition process has been discussed. Initially, the CdO-ZnO nanofibers were prepared by facile wet-chemical process at low-temperature and then characterized by UV–vis, FT-IR, BET, XRD, FESEM, TEM, XPS, and XEDS methods. The results of this approach clearly indicate that the prepared doped nanofibers shows a good photo-catalytic activity than commercially available P25-TiO2, which can be used as an active photo-catalyst for the treatment of colored dyes in wastewater for environmental remediation in broad scale."
873,Anomalous dielectric constant and AC conductivity in mixed transition-metal-ion FeO–(20 – )MnO–80TeO glass system,2016-04-01,"Glasses with xFe2O3–(20 – x)MnO2–80TeO2 (x = 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mol%) composition were prepared by melt-quenching technique to investigate the effects of mixed-transition metal ion Fe2+/ 3+//Mn3+/4+ on AC conductivity and dielectric properties using impedance spectroscopy. Dielectric constant showed strong variation with Fe2O3 at a frequency ≥10 kHz, where ε′ decreased to a minimum value at x = 10 mol% before increasing for x > 10%. The decrease in ε′ may be attributed to some form of hindrance effect on heavy dipoles caused by the mixed transition-ion effect (MTE). Meanwhile, variation of AC conductivity with Fe2O3 showed non-linear increase for x ≤ 10 mol% before dropping to a minimum at 15 mol% Fe2O3. This result was attributed to Anderson localization because of the disorder in the glass system. Conductivity analysis showed that the conduction mechanism at the dispersion region for x = 2 mol% followed the correlated barrier hopping (CBH) model, while the mechanism transformed to the overlapping large polaron tunnelling (OLPT) model at higher Fe2O3, content (x > 2 mol%). The electric modulus of the investigated samples showed asymmetric peak of the imaginary part of electric modulus (M′′), which reflected a non-Debye type relaxation."
874,Enhanced photocatalytic activity of MoO-supported SnO composite synthesized by a wet chemical method,2016-04-01,"We report the one-step synthesis of MoO3-supported SnO2 composite using a wet chemical method. The structural features of the composite with respect to the MoO3 content are discussed. The composites were characterized using X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, thermal-gravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), Raman spectroscopy, high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and BET surface area analysis. 2.5 mol% MoO3-supported SnO2 sample has higher surface area of 51.6 m2g–1 than that of pure SnO2, 1 and 5 mol% MoO3-supported SnO2 samples. The photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) using the MoO3-supported SnO2 composite under UV light irradiation is reported. The photocatalytic properties were also studied with different concentrations of MoO3, and the influence of morphology on the photocatalytic activity was elucidated. The active edges of MoO3 could promote UV absorption for reactant diffusion. The heterogeneous structure with different energies improved and facilitated charge separation and enhanced the photocatalytic activity compared to pure SnO2, MoO3. The MoO3-supported SnO2 photocatalyst shows good photostability and easy recovery from dye for recycling."
875,Determination of bimodal size distribution using dynamic light scattering methods in the submicrometer size range,2016-04-01,"Determining the size distribution of manufactured materials is essential for industry and biotechnology. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) has been widely used for determining size distributions in the submicrometer size range; however, DLS is not reliable for measuring the apparent size distribution of materials over a wide size distribution because of the method's low resolution. Therefore, we examined the coverage and accuracy of using experimental DLS method and theoretical approach to determine a submicrometer bimodal size distribution. For a mixture of two different sizes of submicrometer-sized polystyrene latex particles with a size difference of more than 6-fold, the model of simple summation of two different photon correlation functions between the non-interacting particles agreed well with the experimental DLS homodyne photon correlation function. However, for a mixture of particles with a size difference 2- or 3.3-fold, the homodyne correlation functions were approximately linear and DLS could not give a stable, accurate bimodal size distribution. For particles with a size difference of less than 6-fold, a combination of flow field-flow fractionation and sizing analysis methods was used to obtain a more accurate estimation of the bimodal size distribution in the submicrometer range."
876,CO separation from air using microporous polyvinylidene fluoride-supported triethylene glycol/alkanolamine liquid membranes,2016-04-01,"Supported liquid membranes (SLMs) were prepared by impregnating the hydrophilically modified surfaces of microporous polyvinylidene fluoride membranes with mixtures of triethylene glycol (TEG) and alkanolamines. Monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), triethanolamine (TEA), and N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) were selected as representative primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, respectively. The permeabilities of these membranes to CO2 and N2 were measured and compared. Among the alkanolamines, MEA was the most effective in separating CO2 from mixed gas or atmospheric air. However, in the blended alkanolamine liquid membrane, a tertiary amine promoted better CO2 permeation performance through a TEG/primary (or secondary) alkanolamine liquid membrane. The selectivity of TEG/alkanolamine liquid membrane for CO2 with respect to N2 was over 2000, which was derived from the permeation experiments under CO2/N2 and pure N2 feed gas. The effects of alkanolaime concentration, viscosity of liquid, and CO2 concentration and water vapor in the feed gas on the membrane performance were investigated in detail. Unlike the permeance of N2, the membrane permeance to CO2 was closely related to the alkanolamine species and its concentration because of the chemical interaction between CO2 and the alkanolamines. This proves that the supported TEG/alkanolamine liquid membranes showed high CO2 separation performance and stability, and they are useful for CO2 separation from air."
877,Novel volatile organic compound (VOC) sensor based on Ag-decorated porous single-crystalline ZnO nanosheets,2016-04-01,"To develop efficient and convenient sensing technology for volatile organic compound (VOCs) detection in residential buildings and process control in industries becomes necessary for human health. Various ZnO nanostructures have been employed in VOC detection for their good performance. Among those nanostructures, porous single-crystalline (PSC) ZnO nanosheets not only exhibited highly-sensitive performance but also possessed significantly long-term stability. However, the sensitivity might be further improved by modification noble metal elements. In present work, Ag nanoparticles have been decorated onto the PSC ZnO nanosheets by a sunlight induced solvent reduction method. The as-prepared products have been characterized by SEM, TEM, HRTEM and EDS. By combining the advantages of structure and modification, the sensitivity of the Ag-decorated PSC ZnO nanosheets is 8.8 times higher than that of the bare one. The single-crystalline structure exhibited low electric noise which may lower the detection limit of the sensor."
878,High mobility top gated field-effect transistors and integrated circuits based on chemical vapor deposition-derived monolayer MoS,2016-04-01,"Monolayer MoS2 with large area and high quality are grown using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on Si/SiO2 substrate, the triangle grain size is about 50 μm, and top-gated field-effect transistors (FETs) were fabricated using atomic layer deposition (ALD) grown HfO2 at low temperature as high-k gate insulator. The transistors present typical n-type field-effect properties, especially with high carrier mobility up to about 36.4 cm2/Vs, which is the highest value of mobility of top gated transistors based on CVD-derived single layer MoS2. Two kinds of methods were used to extract mobility from the measured properties of FETs, and the consistent results indicated the retrieved mobility was reliable. In addition an inverter circuit with gain larger than 1 was constructed based on the n-type FETs."
879,Temperature dependent current–voltage curves study of GaN-based blue light-emitting diode,2016-04-01,"We have investigated the current–voltage curves of the GaN-based blue light-emitting diode (LED) at different temperatures. The LED chips were fixed in a closed-cycle He cryostat with temperature varying from 220 K to 300 K, and current–voltage curves were measured with a source-meter. The current–voltage curves can be divided into four parts: the tunneling current zone, the recombination current zone, the diffusion current zone and the series resistance zone. The transitions in voltage and current between the zones vary as the temperature increases. We fitted the ideality factor and saturation current of the GaN-based LED from the I–V curve data according to the SahNoyce–Shockley theory. The experimental results demonstrate that the ideality factor improves as the temperature reduces, as does the saturation current. The value of ideality factor is much bigger than 2.0 in our experiments. A PN-MQW combination heterojunction model is proposed to explain the high value of the ideality factor of the GaN-based LED."
880,Preparation and photocatalytic performance of a Pr–SiO–TiO nanocomposite for degradation of aqueous dye wastewater,2016-02-01,"A novel Pr–SiO2–TiO2 nanocomposite catalyst was prepared by a sol–gel method and its photocatalytic degradation efficiency on Rhodamine B (RhB) was examined in aqueous dye wastewater. The structure and morphology of the catalyst samples were characterized using by low-temperature N2 adsorption, thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Pr–SiO2–TiO2 nanocomposite was found to exhibit a much higher photocatalytic activity under both UV and visible light irradiation as compared to a commercial TiO2 photocatalyst. The photodegradation efficiency of RhB (5 mg/L) were greater than 95% under UV light irradiation and 91% under visible light irradiation for 90 min, respectively. It is suggested that the synergetic effect between Pr–SiO2 and TiO2 not only inhibit the crystal growth and anatase-to-rutile transformation, but also extend the light response to the visible region. The prepared represents a noteworthy contribution to the study of pollutant degradation in dye wastewaters."
881,"Fabrication of micro- and nano-scale hierarchical structures on Al surface with enhanced wettability, anti-corrosion and wear resistance",2016-02-01,"Via a facial method of mixed acid erosion, chemical inactivation and surface modification treatment, the enhanced wettability, anti-corrosion and wear resistance property can be achieved on 1060 aluminum (Al) surface. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) shows that the optimized micro- and nano-scale binary hierarchical structures consisting of the eroded stair-step microstructures and the inactivating nano-sacle particles layers have been constructed. In addition, results of electrochemical test exhibit the as-prepared surface with a water contact angle (CA) of 156.1° can possess a lower corrosion current density (I corr) and a higher corrosion potential (E corr than untreated surface after modification with ethanol solution of trichloro-(1H,1H,2H,2H-heptadecafluorodecyl)-silane (TDFS). Meanwhile, the droplets bouncing and tribological tests have also been conducted to confirm the better wettability and a lower friction coefficient and wear rate for the treated Al surface. This work will be active in enlarging the engineering applications of Al."
882,Fluorine substituted thienyl-quinoxaline copolymer to reduce the highest occupied molecular orbit level and increase open-circuit voltage for organic solar cells,2016-02-01,"An alternating polymer (FTTQ) based on fluorine substituted thienyl-quinoxaline as electron-withdrawing unit was synthesized and characterized. FTTQ showed similar absorption property in comparison with that of the counterpart polymer without fluorine atom (synthesized TTQ). However, the low-lying highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) energy level of FTTQ was –5.30 eV, about 0.24 eV smaller than that of synthesized TTQ (–5.06 eV). In order to study the photovoltaic properties of the materials, polymer solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with FTTQ as donor blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as acceptor, as well as with an alcohol/water-soluble conjugated polymer, poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)](PFN) as a cathode interlayer. The PSCs incorporating the PFN interlayer showed significant and simultaneous enhancement in open-circuit voltage (V oc), short-circuit current density (J SC) and fill factor (FF), which leaded to a PCE of 2.59% for an optimized FTTQ:PC71BM weight ratio of 1:2 with THF vapor annealing for 30 s, in comparison with that of synthesized TTQ-based device (PCE of 1.41%). These findings will be of importance for achieving high-performance of polymer solar cells by functional group substitution in low band gap polymers."
883,Study of thermal and optical properties of epoxy/organically modified silicate hybrids,2016-02-01,"Three epoxy resins were examined in this study: Eporite-901 (474 g/eq), Eporite-904 (807 g/eq) and Eporite-909 (1915 g/eq), which are bisphenol-A-type epoxy resins. In this study, we used an amine terminated organically modified silicate (Ormosil) that was compatible with the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A epoxy to partially replace the epoxy resin at various ratios, cured by hexahydrophthalic anhydride (HHPA). The thermal and optical properties of the Ormosil-modified epoxy resins (Epoxy/Ormosil) were studied. The Mn  and Mw  of the resulting hybrids were in the range of 10668–31450 and 30617–120422, respectively, with a polydispersity index range of 2.870–3.829. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results implied that Ormosil can raise the crosslink density and enhance the thermal properties. The optical properties were measured after curing and thermal aging of the polymer films with thickness around 8–10 mm. The refractive indexes of the Epoxy/Ormosil hybrids were 1.62–1.68, and the transmittances of the cured composites were above 85% in the visible wavelength. The key attributes of Epoxy/Ormosil hybrids that make them attractive materials for LEDs including their high transparency in the UV-visible region, controlled refractive index (RI), and excellent thermal resistance."
884,"Luminescence properties and energy transfer in KMgSiO:Ce , Tb  as a green phosphor",2016-02-01,"Series new green K2MgSiO4:Ce3+, Tb3+ phosphors were synthesized by solid-state reaction method. The crystal structure, luminescence and reflectance spectra, energy transfer mechanism and temperature dependent performance have been investigated respectively. The information of crystal structure was detected by X-ray diffraction, and the optimized doping concentration of Ce3+ ions and Tb3+ ions were confirmed to 4% mol and 2% mol, respectively. The energy transfer mechanism has been validated to be a resonant type via a dipole–dipole interaction with high efficiency of 55.1%. The energy transfer critical distance of this phosphor was calculated by the concentration quenching method (14.08 Å) and spectral-overlap method (15.68 Å).

885,Simulation of tunable metamaterial perfect absorber by modulating BiSe dielectric function,2016-02-01,"We numerically present an effective method for tuning the intrinsic resonance of metamaterial perfect absorber by taking advantage of phase transition in a topological insulator (bismuth selenide, Bi2Se3) in the near-infrared (NIR) region. The design consists of an array of square Au rods separated from a continuous Au film by a Bi2Se3 dielectric interlayer. It is shown that a large shift of 280 nm in the resonance wavelength can be obtained by switching Bi2Se3 between its trigonal and orthorhombic states. The strong absorbance shows a substantial overlap between TE and TM polarization states over a wide range of incident angles."
886,Preparation and infrared/millimeter wave attenuation properties of magnetic expanded graphite by explosive combustion,2016-02-01,"A composite based on magnetic iron particles and expanded graphite was prepared by an explosive combustion and blending method. It was then introduced into a smoke canister, and colloidal silicone rubber (RTV-615) was used as an infrared and millimeter wave absorber. The infrared shielding effectiveness was investigated by measuring the thermal extinction using the smoke canister for dynamic testing with a thermal imager in the 8–12 μm range. The millimeter wave absorbing properties were investigated by measuring the transmission loss in the 32–38 GHz microwave frequency range with a network analyzer using the free space method. The effects of structure, media material type (carbonyl iron powder and Fe3O4 and weight ratio on the infrared/millimeter wave attenuation properties of magnetic expanded graphite were also studied. The results showed that the magnetic expanded graphite had excellent infrared (8–12 μm) and millimeter wave (35 GHz) interference abilities and could be used as a new material for obscuring infrared and millimeter waves. For magnetic expanded graphite with a concentration of 2 mg/cm3, the thermal extinction reached 31 °C, and at a weight ratio (expanded graphite:magnetic iron particles) of 2:1 (3 mg/cm3 and a thickness of 1.5 mm, the minimum transmission loss value was –10.8 dB in the 32–38 GHz range."
887,Anatomy of high recyclability of graphene oxide based palladium nanocomposites in the Sonogashira reaction: On the nature of the catalyst deactivation,2016-02-01,"Although graphene based palladium (Pd) nanocomposites are known as efficient catalysts in the Sonogashira C–C cross-coupling reaction, it has been reported that the catalysts are easily deactivated after several uses. To evaluate the nature of the deactivation, we have prepared Pd nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed on reduced graphene oxide (Pd/RGO) and graphene oxide (Pd/GO), and characterized their morphological and electronic structures in the recycling of the Sonogashira reactions using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Here, we demonstrate that Pd/GO revealed higher recyclability in the Sonogashira reaction when compared with Pd/RGO. The origin of the remarkable recyclability of Pd/GO is the presence of oxygen functionalities on the surface of GO, which can provide nucleation sites for the detached Pd adatoms during the Sonogashira reaction. As a result, Pd/GO can continuously promote the dispersion of smaller Pd NPs and keep providing highly reactive catalytic sites for the consecutive Sonogashira reactions. We also found strong evidence that oxidation states of Pd in the catalysts are not closely associated with catalytic efficiency and recyclability in the Sonogashira reaction."
888,Thermal annealing of graphene to remove polymer residues,2016-02-01,"The process of graphene transfer generally involves a polymer support. Thermal annealing of graphene monolayers transferred from Cu to SiO2/Si substrate has been investigated to remove polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) residue. The results show that a clean graphene surface without any deterioration is difficult to obtain by conventional thermal annealing method owing to the reaction between the graphene and the carbon by-products from the residual polymers. Although a higher annealing temperature facilitates removal of the polymer residue on graphene surface, it may also increase the amount of amorphous carbon. In this work, we examine various annealing conditions to remove the polymer residue. Annealing under H2 ambience is effective in removing pendant functional groups in the polymer, yet increases the amorphous carbon also. In case of Ar ambience with high temperature, the polymer residue is efficiently removed without amorphous carbon."
889,Surface-enhanced Raman scattering based on colloidal Ag nanoparticles for quantitative detection of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide,2016-02-01,"In this paper, colloidal Ag nanoparticles with uniform particle size were prepared by sodium citrate as reducing agent, and used as a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) active substrate to detect quantitatively trace cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB). It was found that the intensity of SERS band of CTAB increase as the proper concentration of CTAB was gradually added to the colloidal Ag nanoparticles. The self-assembly CTAB fabricated on the colloidal Ag nanoparticles induced by electrostatic interactions of the cationic surfactant CTAB and citrate-reduced silver nanoparticles, which caused the formation of a SERS active substrate with the larger enhancement. The intensity of the CTAB signal and its concentration in the range of 1.0–7.5 μM shows a linear response with a low detection limit of 0.79 μM. This proposed SERS-based method of trace CTAB determination shows excellent sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility without adding the probe molecules. It may have potential applications in many areas."
890,A novel density-controlled growth of vertical polyaniline nanowire arrays using diblock copolymer as a template,2016-02-01,"We develop a novel and simple method for controlling the density and size of polyaniline (PANI) nanowires vertically grown on silicon substrate. The method is based on employing poly(styrene-block-4-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P4VP) nanoporous array on Mn2O3 seed layer as template. The nanoporous template with Mn2O3 seed at the bottom of each nanopore could be achieved by PS-b-P4VP self-assemble on Mn2O3 seed layer and reconstruction in 1 wt% HF methanol solution. Furthermore, PANI nanoparticles could be generated in each nanopore by oxidizing aniline with Mn2O3 seed at the bottom of nanopores. The PANI nanoparticles further grew to nanowires when ammonium peroxydisulfate (APS) was added to the reaction solution. Interestingly, the distance, arrangement and diameter of PANI nanowires were confined by the nanopores. Therefore, density- and size-controlled PANI nanowire arrays with vertical orientation were obtained. The techniques have significant potential application in nanoelectronic devices."
891,Self-assembly of achiral monomer into left-handed helical polyanthracene nanofibers,2016-02-01,"Bionic control over the assembly of achiral molecules into chiral supramolecular architectures is challenging, and typically relies on preexisting templates. We demonstrated that anthracene monomers could self-assemble into polyanthracene (PA) nanofibers with well-defined left-handed helical nanoarchitectures under well-controlled conditions. The spontaneous formation of supramolecular helices might be ascribed to the steric constraints imposed by dehydrocyclization carried out at the 4,8 sites of the benzene ring of the anthracene monomer. Furthermore, high quality, few-layer graphene, derived from the chiral helical PA nanofibers, provided promising prospects and new ideas for functional materials synthesis and chirality amplification."
892,"Effect of DyO intergranular addition on microstructure and magnetic properties of (Nd, Dy)–Fe–B sintered magnets",2016-02-01,"Dy2O3 powders with high melting point and low cost have been added into the (Nd, Dy)–Fe–B sintered magnets. Strengthened local magnetocrystalline anisotropy induced by intergranular addition of Dy-containing sources is effective to simultaneously enhance coercivity and minimize remanence loss for Nd2Fe14B-type sintered magnets. In this work, the addition of Dy2O3 promotes the formation of Dy-enriched shells surrounding the 2:14:1 phase grains and reduces the grain size effectively. As a result, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy field H A of the outer regions of the matrix phase is strengthened, accompanied with reduction of local demagnetization stray fields. Enhanced coercivity H cj from 17.5 to 24.3 kOe has been achieved by the addition of 4.0 wt% Dy2O3. The existence of Dy2O3 is also beneficial to improve the grain alignment with the remanence B r maintained above 12.0 kGs. Optimized addition of 2 wt% Dy2O3 gives rise to maximized H cj/kOe+(BH)max/MGOe as a result of balanced coercivity enhancement and magnetic dilution effect. Intergranular addition of Dy2O3 exhibits great potential in producing Nd2Fe14B-based magnets with high coercivity and reduced material cost."

High resolution electron micrographs show unique circular disc like polycrystalline graphene structures. The nanodiscs are transparent, range between 20–50 nm in diameter, consists 1–2 layers, do not fold, easily dispersed in aqueous ethanolic solution and exhibit supramolecular behavior of self assembly. The nanodiscs exhibit dual characteristics, viz., circular disc like structures when dispersed in aqueous ethanolic solution, and flake like structures when dehydrated. The article addresses in detail the intricate intrigues of the synthesis, characterization and its supramolecular behavior."
894,Microencapsulation and characterization of polyamic acid microcapsules containing -octadecane via electrospraying method,2015-12-01,"As an intermediate polymer of polyimide, polyamic acid (PAA) was synthesized by ternary copolymerization of pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA), 4,4′-oxydianiline (4,4′-ODA) and 2,6-diaminoanthraquinone (2,6-DAAQ). Furthermore, spherical core/shell PAA/n-octadecane microcapsules were produced via coaxial electrospraying. The molecular structure of PAA was determined by fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR). The morphology, microstructure and thermal properties of PAA microencapsulated n-octadecane were investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively. The diameters of microcapsules ranged from 0.5 to 3 μm, and the surface morphology was influenced by the core (n-octadecane) solution feed rate. With core feed rate increasing, the surface of microcapsules turned from smooth and uniform to sags and crests, moreover, their mean diameter increased and then decreased. Meanwhile, the DSC results revealed that microcapsules had relatively high enthalpy (∼107 J/g) and associated by supercooling phenomenon. Due to the excellent thermal stability of shell materials, the 40% weight loss temperature of PAA microcapsules reached as high as 500 °C."
895,Ternary blend bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells based on double donors and single acceptor with ultra wideband absorption,2015-12-01,"We demonstrated the simple device configuration and low-cost processing technology of single-junction BHJ cells while inheriting the major benefit of incorporating multiple polymers in tandem cells. Ternary blend bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with high-band-gap PBDTTPD and low-band-gap PC20 BDTDPP as donor polymers, with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61 BM) as acceptor were studied. In this ternary blend BHJ, free charge carriers travel through their corresponding donor-polymer-linked channels and fullerene-enriched domain to the electrodes, and the ternary blend BHJ solar cells showed power conversion efficiencies of up to 5.16%. This added to the growing evidence that the use of ternary blends is a general and effective strategy for producing efficient organic photovoltaics manufactured in a single active-layer processing step."
896,Effect of collagen peptides-carboxymethyl chitosan microspheres on ultraviolet induced damages,2015-12-01,"Type I collagen peptides were prepared by hydrolysis of type I collagen protein with different enzyme combinations and this study found that the peptides obtained by papain/pepsin/trypsin combination hydrolysis were of the strongest anti-X-ray capability. The collagen peptides-carboxymethyl chitosan (CP-CMC-CaCl2) microspheres were prepared by emulsification method and used to investigate the effects on mice skin damages in vitro and in vivo. In vitro experiments indicated that the CP-CMC-CaCl2 microspheres had a protective effect on the X-ray irradiated damages of mice thymus lymphocytes. The mice skin surface texture morphological and histomorphological analysis showed a consistent result that the CP-CMC-CaCl2 microspheres played a certain role in the prevention of UV-B irradiated skin damages and could also improve ultraviolet prevention ability. Besides, the preventive function was better than its repair function. It is possible to improve the preventive function to skin photoaging and play a better effectiveness of cosmetic skin care by adding the CP-CMC-CaCl2 microspheres into make-up cosmetics as a natural antioxidant resource."
897,Mechanical and dynamic properties of nettle-polyester composite,2015-12-01,"This work deals with the use of Himalayan Nettle (a natural plant fiber) as a reinforcement in polyester resin matrix and characterisation of as-formed nettle-polyester composite. Tensile test on single nettle fibers revealed that the Young's modulus and tensile strength decrease with increase in fiber diameter, and chemical composition test results show that the fiber has higher content of cellulose, hemi-cellulose and lignin that result in better mechanical, biodegrading and thermal stability properties of the composite respectively. Characterization of mechanical properties of randomly-oriented short himalayan nettle fiber reinforced-polyester resin matrix composite was done using tensile, compression and flexural test results. New analytical models were developed considering the effects of orientation and variation of fiber diameters for the determination of Young's modulus and tensile strength. The models are found to yield results which are in good correlation with experimental results. Experimental modal analysis was carried out on cantilever beam specimens for determining material and material plus structural damping ratios using half power band-width method. At higher frequencies, the average damping ratios were found to be 4 to 10 times higher than polymer concrete, C.I. and steel materials. Morphological analysis of the composite (SEM) revealed the structure of the nettle fiber to be hollow, which helps to improve specific stiffness and vibration absorption ability."
898,"Formation, characterization, and properties of radiopaque TaC–C/C and ZrO–C/C composites",2015-12-01,"TaC-carbon/carbon composites and ZrO2-carbon/carbon composites were prepared by liquid-phase infiltration. Microstructure, phase, flexural strength, and radiopacity were examined using a scanning electron microscope, an X-ray diffractometer, an electronic universal testing machine, and a dental X-ray unit. Results showed that ZrO2 and TaC phases were formed in carbon/carbon composites during heat treatment because of decomposition and the reaction between Ta2O5 and C. The surface micrograph showed that TaC and ZrO2 particles were embedded in the carbon matrix. TaC-carbon/carbon composites and ZrO2-carbon/carbon composites displayed pseudoductile fracture behavior. Radiopaque properties of TaC-carbon/carbon composites and ZrO2-carbon/carbon composites increased with increased concentration of ethylate tantalum and zirconium acetate solutions.

899,Growth and spectral properties of Yb/Ho co-doped NaGd(MoO) crystal,2015-12-01,"A Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped NaGd(MoO4)2 crystal was successfully grown by the Czochralski method. The crystal structure and lattice parameters were determined by the powder X-ray diffraction method. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of the crystal were investigated at room temperature. The refractive index of NaGd(MoO4)2 crystal was calculated according to the infrared-corrected Sellmeier equation. Based on the Judd-Ofelt theory, the intensity parameters Ω t  (t = 2, 4, 6) of Ho3+ were derived. The spontaneous transition probabilities, the fluorescent branching ratios and the radiative lifetimes of the main multiplets of Ho3+ ion were calculated as well. The stimulated emission cross section for the transition from 5 I 7 to 5 I 8 of Ho3+ was calculated to be 1.2320 × 10–20 cm–2 by the Füchtbauer-Ladenburg equation with the full width at half maximum of 117.8 nm."
900,Surface characterization of as-grown CeO cap layer morphology evolution and critical current density of post-deposited YBCO films,2015-12-01,"Cerium dioxide (CeO2) cap layers for high temperature superconducting coated conductors were fabricated on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) single crystal substrates via the unbalanced radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering method. YBa2Cu3O7–δ (YBCO) films were epitaxially deposited on the as-grown CeO2/YSZ (001) stacks using water-free metal organic deposition (MOD) method. The surface morphology evolution of CeO2 cap layers could be tuned by adjusting the sputtering pressure, from smooth and uniformly granular, to rough and composed of spindle-like islands. According to the atomic force microscopy (AFM) data, a monotonic relationship could be found between the root mean squared (RMS) roughness value and flat area fraction. The critical current density (J c) of the MOD-YBCO film varied significantly along with the CeO2 morphology evolution, caused by the degradation of YBCO film's epitaxial growth. It was found that the as-grown CeO2 cap layer deposited at 0.5 Pa could serve as a favorable template and did not require post-modification, on which YBCO film with J c of 1.92 MA/cm2 (77 K, self-field) could be obtained. The MOD process would be improved in our future study by parameter optimization to enhance the J c property of YBCO films."
901,Atmospheric pressure growth and optimization of graphene using liquid-injection chemical vapor deposition,2015-12-01,"Here we present a method to grow graphene on polycrystalline Cu and Ni foils by an atmospheric pressure thermal chemical vapor deposition process using liquid precursors. A syringe injection system is used to deliver the precursor into a horizontal tube furnace. Precise control over the injection rate and amount allow us to regulate the amount of active species taking part in graphene growth. The common aromatic solvent toluene is used to produce large area monolayer and few-layer graphene films on Cu and Ni, respectively. A parametric study of various growth parameters reveals that the graphene growth proceeds rapidly and that its quality depends strongly on the amount of hydrogen and injection rate of solvent. Our study highlights the feasibility of large-scale graphene growth using liquid precursors via precise control of the rate and amount of hydrocarbon injected, without the need for expensive vacuum pumps. Furthermore, our method has the potential to be extended to making doped graphene films by choosing the appropriate precursors."
902,Influence of NCO/OH and transesterified castor oil on the structure and properties of polyurethane: Synthesis and characterization,2015-10-01,"A series of polyurethane (MBPUs) with varying stoichiometric balance i.e., isocyanate (NCO): hydroxyl groups (OH) ratio (viz. 1:1, 1.2:1 and 1.4:1), was synthesized using transesterified castor oil and partially biobased isocyanate. The chemical properties, kinetics, thermal stability, morphology and mechanical properties of the MBPUs were analyzed systematically. FTIR results confirmed the synthesis of MBPUs and the increase in hydrogen bonding with the increase in NCO/OH molar ratio. A three step degradation mechanism for MBPU films was observed through TGA analysis. The DSC study revealed that the glass transition temperature (Tg ) increases with increase in NCO/OH molar ratio. Broad scattering halos observed from WAXD pattern of MBPU films revealed its amorphous nature. The phase separated surface morphology of MBPUs was noticed in SEM and AFM images. Flory Rehner Equation was used for determining the molecular weight between crosslinks and degree of crosslinking. From the mechanical analysis, it was inferred that the NCO/OH molar ratio had a profound effect on the tensile properties and modulus."
903,Effect of saccharides as carbon source on the synthesis and morphology of BC fine particles from carbothermal synthesis precursors,2015-10-01,"Crystalline boron carbide powder was synthesized by carbothermal reduction of the condensed product of boric acid and three different carbon sources, i.e., cellulose, glucose, and starch. The effects of structural homogeneity of precursors on the low-temperature synthesis of B4C powder were investigated on the basis of sacchridederiven structural development. The formation of condensed products was confirmed by FTIR and TGA analyses. The conditions suitable for preparation of precursors were optimized. The precursors obtained by thermal decomposition of condensed cellulose products had more homogeneous and fine structure composed of B2O3 and carbon fibers. The dispersion state of B2O3 in carbon matrix of precursors significantly affected the acceleration of synthesis reaction. The formation of B4C in the case of the cellulose precursor started at a temperature of about 1100 °C which is around 150–250 °C lower than that for glucose and starch precursors. The B4C formation completed for cellulose precursor at 1200 °C (one of the lowest temperatures reported for polymeric precursor route) within a short time because the diffusion of reacting species was favored by increasing the contact area of carbon fibers/B2O3. The B4C particles synthesized from glucose and starch precursors were polyhedral. The morphology of B4C particles, synthesized from cellulose precursor, transformed from polyhedral to equiaxed as the synthesis temperature was raised from 1150 °C to 1200 °C. The nitrogen physisorption measurements had revealed that the synthesized B4C powder exhibited the mesopores and the macropores, and the powder synthesized from cellulose precursor had the highest specific surface area among all the tested materials."
904,Self-supported Ag/AgCl nanoparticles incorporated polymeric multilayer films for reusable electrophotocatalyst,2015-10-01,"We describe here, synthesis and electrophotocatalytic activity of the nanocomposites of Ag/AgCl embedded in polymeric matrix. The nanocomposites were synthesized through a sequence of steps. First, polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) were formed on ITO or glass slides. The multilayered films were then dipped into an aqueous solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3) under ambient conditions to incorporate Ag+ ions into the PEM films, in which Ag+ ions combine with Cl– ions of PAH to form AgCl nanoparticles. A part of AgCl was partially reduced by PAH to form metallic Ag in contact with AgCl. The composite materials were characterized by several microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) proved the simultaneous presence of Ag+ ions and metallic Ag in the films. The amount of Ag in the films was also quantified with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICPOES). The nanocomposites found application towards electrophotocatalytic degradation of the dye of methylene blue. Multiple hetero-junctions created in the ternary composite synergistically enhance the photocatalytic activity. Since the catalyst is prepared in the form of film, it can be readily separated from the experimental set up and can be reused. As a result, it shows minimum loss of catalytic activity after five cycles. In addition, the catalyst can degrade colorless organic contaminant of 2-chlorophenol."
905,Improved nanomechanical properties of hydrogenated tetrahedral amorphous carbon films measured with ultra low indentation load,2015-10-01,"This paper reports the nanomechanical properties of as grown and hydrogenated tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C, ta-C: H) films deposited by S-bend filtered cathodic vacuum arc technique measured with 1.4 mN load. It has been found that the hydrogenation of ta-C film improved the nanomechanical properties. Maximum hardness (H) of 38.15 GPa (with improvement of ∼80%) has been obtained for ta-C: H film deposited at a hydrogen partial pressure of 1.4 × 10–1 Pa and maximum elastic modulus (E) value of 410.1 GPa has been obtained when the hydrogen partial pressure reduced to 7.4 × 10–3 Pa. The plastic index parameter (H/E) of ta-C: H film (0.11) is found to be superior to that of ta-C film (0.073), which is a measure of wear resistance for coating applications. The improved H/E of ta-C: H films may be due to the passivation of surface defects and favorable formation of sp3 hybridized bonds."

The catalytic activity was found to be increased with increasing Ni content, and the maximum removal efficiency (COD, 62%; color, 75%) was obtained with Ce40Ni60 nano-catalyst. The increased biodegradability from 0.27 to 0.42 proved the feasibility of CWAO in degradation of non-biodegradable compounds. The overall reactions during CWAO were found to follow the first order kinetics in terms of COD and color removal."

908,Glycine-assisted preparation of CoO nanoflakes with enhanced performance for non-enzymatic glucose sensing,2015-10-01,"In this study a simple, inexpensive and efficient route is proposed to synthesise attractive cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanostructures using glycine as an effective growth controller and regulator. The as-synthesised Co3O4 nanostructures were observed to possess unique nanoflake shape morphological features with highly dense distribution. The formation of Co3O4 nanoflakes (Co3O4 NFKs) was elaborately explored using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) respectively. The unique Co3O4 nanoflakes were known to possess excellent electro-catalytic potential for the oxidation of glucose in alkaline medium. This potential property allowed successful development of highly sensitive (1180 μA mM–1 cm–2), selective and stable non-enzymatic glucose sensor. In addition, the developed sensor had a wide working range (0.1–5.0 mM), low limit of detection (0.7 M), and excellent reproducibility, besides the capability of analysing real blood glucose samples."
909,Degradation of mixed dyes in aqueous wastewater using a novel visible light driven LiMgMnO photocatalyst,2015-10-01,"A simple and modified sol–gel method was employed for the synthesis of LiMg0.5Mn0.5O2 and it was further investigated as the photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. LiMg0.5Mn0.5O2 was characterized using various analytical techniques in order to understand its phase confirmation, optical properties, morphology and chemical composition. The color of the LiMg0.5Mn0.5O2 was dark brown as it could be expected from its absorption spectrum. The bandgap energy of LiMg0.5Mn0.5O2 was estimated as 1.42 eV and therefore it would respond under visible light. The photocatalytic activity of LiMg0.5Mn0.5O2 was assessed based on the mixed aqueous solutions containing methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) under visible light. The photocatalyst showed preferential decomposition of MO in comparison to MB in the mixed dye solution. Different scavenger tests were carried out to detect the reactive species, responsible for the degradation of dyes and the possible photocatalytic degradation mechanism was also discussed."
910,Surface energy modification of a Na-mordenite thin layer treated by an alkaline solution,2015-10-01,"The determination of the surface free energy of zeolite membranes is a key parameter to determine the solutes affinity with the active filtration layer. Flat mordenite (MOR-type) zeolite membranes were synthesized on α-alumina platelets by deep coating methodology. These membranes have undergone an alkali treatment. Surface and textural characterizations were performed before and after the mild alkali treatment in order to evaluate the modifications of the zeolite structure, surface charge and polarity. Results showed that the mild alkali treatment increases the hydrophilicity of Na-mordenite surface. The OWRK (Owens, Wendt, Rabel and Kaelble) method allowed following the variation of the polar component of the free energy due to the extraction of silicon atoms from the zeolite framework. These results contribute strongly in the understanding of mass transport in porous tubular ultrafiltration (UF)/nanofiltration (NF) zeolite membranes."
911,Doping the LiTiO lattice with extra-large anions,2015-10-01,"Doping is always serving as an effective way to improve the performance of electrode materials of lithium ion batteries (LIBs). This study reports the synthesis of a well-defined Li4Ti5O12–  x Br x  anode (x= 0–0.4) using a conventional solid-state reaction method. Atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed that the large-radius Br dopant was uniformly distributed and occupied the specific locations of oxygen ions in spinel Li4Ti5O12 leading to slight lattice expansion. A density functional theory calculation (DFT) further confirmed the obtained experimental results and demonstrated the change of the local fine structure due to the large radius of the dopant Br.

912,"Three-dimensionally macroporous, Si and N-incorporated graphene aerogels for gas adsorbents",2015-10-01,"Three-dimensionally macroporous, Si and N-incorporated graphene aerogels (3D SN-rGOAs) are successfully fabricated through a self-assembly, vapor deposition of (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES), and thermal treatment for gas adsorption applications. As investigated by spectroscopic methods, the interaction between oxygen-containing groups of GO and APTES results in the uniform incorporation of Si and N atoms on the surface of 3D SN-rGOAs. The resulting SN-rGOAs are composed of the 3D interconnected macroporous structures with the mesoporosity by means of the reorganization of rGO sheets. The existence and distribution of Si and N atoms are characterized and their atomic compositions are 6.19 and 4.24%, respectively. Even after the incorporation of Si and N atoms, the surface area and pore volume of SN-rGOAs are slightly larger than those of pristine rGOAs due to thermal treatment at 900 °C, which also promotes the further restoration of sp2 conjugation. The as-obtained SN-rGOAs show a dramatic improvement in the adsorption capacities and kinetics of CO2 and SO2 because of the existences of Si and N atoms and 3D macroporous continuity."
913,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic study of single-stranded DNA-immobilized electroactive polypyrrole-coated electrospun poly(-caprolactone) nanofibers,2015-08-01,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy study of electroactive poly(ε-caprolactone)/polypyrrole (PCL/PPy) electrospun nanofibers which are functionalized with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) were performed for the first time. PCL nanofibers which have high loading capacity for bioactive molecules were fabricated by electrospinning. ssDNA were immobilized onto PCL/PPy nanofibers following to pyrrole (Py) polymerization on electrospun PCL nanofibers. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and equivalent electrical circuit modeling was used to investigate the changes in interfacial electrical properties of PCL/PPy nanofibers that arise from ssDNA immobilization, and hybridization with complementary and non-complementary DNA sequences. The surface morphology of the DNA immobilized PCL/PPy nanofibers become rough and the fiber diameters were increased. Elemental analyses and EDX-mapping showed that the ssDNA was evenly distributed on the surface of the nanofibers. Charge transfer resistance (Rct) of ssDNA/PPy/PCL nanofibers were decreased with the increasing concentrations of immobilized DNA. After hybridization with fully complementary DNA, significant decreased in charge transfer resistance and solution resistance was observed due to change of surface charge of nanofibers and conformation of DNA during the hybridization process. PCL/PPy nanofiber mats were found to be promising materials which would be used in electrochemical biosensor applications."
914,Preparation of anti-reflection glass surface with self-cleaning and anti-dust by ammonium hydroxide hydrothermal method,2015-08-01,"A simple method to prepare glass surface with anti-reflection and self-cleaning by ammonium hydroxide solution hydrothermal process is reported here. The transmittance of glass in visible light is enhanced from 91% to 98% in the wavelength range of 450∼550 nm after the treatment. The maximal increase of transmittance is as high as 7.3% near 500 nm wavelength (double-sided surfaces). Scanning electron microscope results showed that different porous nanostructured layers are formed, including massive bulges, networked irregular nanoflakes and worm-eaten nanoflakes, under different treatment conditions. The thickness of nanostructured layers will increase with the extending of treatment temperature and time. We also demonstrated that the treated glass surface under the optimized condition has not only high light transmittance and superhydrophilicity, but also better anti-dust property."
915,Mechanical properties of inorganic solidified foam for mining rock fracture filling,2015-08-01,"The mechanical properties of inorganic solidified foam (ISF) including the elastic compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, crushing engineering stress, plateau engineering stress and dense strain were investigated using the electrical universal testing machine. The elastic compressive strength and modulus of elasticity for ISF increased first and then decreased, reached a maximum value when the fly ash content was 30 wt%. The effect of fly ash content on the elastic compressive strength and modulus of elasticity was analyzed by measurement of bubble size distribution and scanning electron microscopy of the pore walls. Based on previous research into the mechanical properties of cement-based foam materials, a well-fitted exponential correlation of the density and porosity characteristics against elastic compressive strength and modulus of elasticity was established. The relationship between elastic compressive strength and modulus of elasticity can be expressed as a power function with the index less than 1. The engineering stress versus strain curves at low strain rates showed three clear regions: elastic, plastic plateau and dense regions. By analyzing the crushing engineering stress, dense strain, density and other parameters, and combining these with systematic test results, a phenomenological compressive constitutive model of this material was established and verified."

The sensor consisted of rhodamine B hydrazide attached to silica gel solid support. In the presence of Hg2+ the color of the sensor changed from colorless to pink. Importantly, the sensor exhibited high selectivity to Hg2+ detection with negligible interference of other metal ions.

917,A simple large-scale method for preparation of g-CN/SnO nanocomposite as visible-light-driven photocatalyst for degradation of an organic pollutant,2015-08-01,"In this work, we report a simple large-scale method for preparation of g-C3N4/SnO2 nanocomposite as visiblelight-driven photocatalyst. The nanocomposite was prepared by a facile refluxing method at 96 °C for one hour using g-C3N4, SnCl4, and NaOH as the starting materials. The prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive analysis of X-rays, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, and photoluminescence (PL) techniques. Photocatalytic activity of the samples was investigated by degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under visible-light irradiation. The degradation rate constant of RhB on g-C3N4 (90%)/SnO2 nanocomposite is about 2.1 and 9.3-fold higher than those of g-C3N4 and SnO2, respectively. Increase of the photocatalytic activity was related to the separation of electron–hole pairs, confirmed by PL technique. Moreover, the degradation rate constant was initially increased with refluxing time up to one hour and then decreased. It was found that superoxide ions and holes are the main reactive species in the degradation reaction. This work can be applied for preparation of other visible-light-driven photocatalysts based on g-C3N4."
918,Photocatalytic properties of Graphene-SnO-PMMA nanocomposite in the degradation of methylene blue dye under direct sunlight irradiation,2015-08-01,"Graphene-SnO2-PMMA nanocomposite has been prepared by one-pot synthesis. The prepared composite has been subjected to XRD, HR-TEM, FT-IR, XPS, Raman spectroscopy TGA and BET analyses. The average particle size of the SnO2 in the nanocomposite was 5 nm. The Raman spectra showed the intensity ratio of 1.2 for Graphene-SnO2-PMMA nanocomposite. Photocatalytic property has been studied by the degradation of Methylene blue (MB) dye under the UV, visible and sunlight irradiations. The results reveal that the sunlight irradiation facilitates the degradation of MB dye at a minimum time interval (60 min) compared to the time taken for the UV and visible light irradiations for the same process. Finally, 99% of the Methylene blue dye were degraded under the sunlight irradiation."
919,Effect of CuO coating layer on the formation of single sized L1 FePt magnetic nanoparticles,2015-08-01,"Monodisperse FePt nanoparticles with an average diameter of 4.2 nm were successfully synthesized using the chemical polyol process via co-reduction of Fe(acac)3 and Pt(acac)2 precursors. To achieve hard ferromagnetic behavior with L10 phase and face center tetragonal (fct) structure, high temperature annealing was performed. Annealing resulted in decomposition of the surfactants surrounding the particles; therefore, the particles agglomerated together. In this situation, FePt nanoparticles gathered together, and their size became larger. In this work, for the first time, Cu2O oxide with a high melting point was used as a shell around each FePt nanoparticle in order to prevent the agglomeration process. As a result, coercivity (Hc) of FePt and FePt/Cu2O nanoparticles after annealing at 750 °C were equal to 10 and 4.5 kOe, respectively. According to the experimental data we discussed the increase in the coercivity of FePt nanoparticles by increasing annealing temperature. The model is based on the spin-glass like behavior of these particles during annealing procedure. Random exchange and magneto crystalline anisotropy effects are known as the main results of coercivity reduction in magnetic nano particles. These effects are strongly dependent to the annealing temperature of nanoparticles. During disorder–order transition, these two effects are max. As transition continues, these effects vanish and coercivity of nanoparticles increases. Here we will add these two effects to the Hamiltonian of FePt system. The results are in a good agreement with experimental data."
920,Preparation of novel YBiO/BiO heterostructured composite with high visible light photocatalytic activity,2015-08-01,"The highly efficient, visible light responsive composite photocatalyst, YBiO3/Bi2O3 was first prepared by a combination of the precipitation and hydrothermal method. The formation of YBiO3/Bi2O3 heterostructure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Compared to pure Bi2O3, UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) results revealed that the composite exhibits characteristic absorption bands due to the interaction of Bi2O3 and YBiO3 in the heterostructure. Methyl orange (MO) degradation experiments showed that the heterostructured YBiO3/Bi2O3 had a notably higher photocatalytic activity than the individual Bi2O3 under visible light. All experimental results showed that the heterostructure was not only responsible for the high photocatalytic activity but also played a vital role in improving the separation of photo-induced electrons and holes. A possible mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic activity was proposed."

The results indicate that the shapes of dislocation networks of the laminated model and the sandwich model are the symmetrical π-shaped and the symmetrical double-deck π-shaped respectively. We find that the rod dislocation only exists in the sandwich model. The critical shear stress of laminated model is larger than the sandwich model's. The stress and potential energy of dislocation network are larger than other places in the Ni/Ni3Al interface. Moreover, slip systems of the laminated model and the sandwich model are {111}(101), {111}(011), {111}(101) and {111}(011)."

VO2@PSS consisting of a VO2 core and PSS brushes on the surface was prepared by a “grafting from” approach. The Mw of PSS was 2.64 × 105 g/mol and its polydispersity (Mw/Mn) is 1.52. The VO2@PSS/PPy obtained was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), thermo-gravimetric analysis, X-ray powder diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Results showed that VO2@PSS/PPy with a rod-like morphology was successfully fabricated. TEM images revealed the core–shell structure of VO2@PSS/PPy. FTIR, UV-vis and XPS spectra showed the doping state of PPy. Four-point probing was employed to study the electrical conductivity of the VO2@PSS/PPy nanocomposites at room temperature; this technique revealed that the conductivity of the nanocomposites was 0.04 S/cm. The unique physical and chemical properties, controllable morphology, and small dimensional structure of the composites synthesized in this work broaden the potential applications of lithium ion batteries, supercapacitors, sensors and electrodes."

A general and convenient sonochemical process was developed for the preparation of silver chalcogenides by using silver acetate and elemental chalcogens as precursors and ethylenediamine as solvent. The purity of the products was confirmed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) while the morphology of the products was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

Frequency-temperature performance of SAW devices has been investigated as temperature sensors operating under high temperature, which can be up to 500 °C. The results show that the center frequency of resonator at room temperature is 456.6 MHz. The variation of frequency with temperature is linear, and the temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) value is –69.9 ppm/°C. It provides a large, quasi-constant, temperature sensitivity which is suitable for temperature sensor applications. The electromechanical coupling coefficient (K 2) increases with temperature and a linear relationship is observed. The temperature coefficient of K 2 is 821 ppm/°C, which is calculated from linear fitting. The K 2 value is 0.23% at room temperature, but which increases to 0.32% at 500°C, with an increase of 39%."
925,Hierarchical flower-like -AlOOH and -AlO microspheres: Synthesis and adsorption properties,2015-08-01,"Hierarchical flower-like γ-AlOOH (boehmite) microspheres consisting of nanoflakes were successfully prepared by a simple, template-free, and surfactant-free hydrothermal method using pure Al foil as the Al source. γ-Al2O3 microspheres with a well-reserved nanostructure were obtained by subsequent annealing of boehmite product at 600 C. The microspheres with ca. 2 μm diameter comprised numerous nanoflakes, and the formed flower-like nanomaterials have good mesoporous structures. The γ-AlOOH and γ-Al2O3 microspheres have large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas of 137 and 143 m2/g, respectively. Both microspheres have narrow-size distributions. Flower-like polycrystalline boehmite may have formed because of the oriented self-assembly of nanoflakes. The unique hierarchical porous structure and high surface area resulted in excellent adsorption of Congo red in aqueous solution of the flower-like γ-AlOOH and γ-Al2O3, and 95% Congo red was removed in 30 min. These microspheres are promising candidates for waste water treatment."
926,Au/InO and Au/ZrO composite nanoparticles via  sacrificial gold electrolysis,2015-06-01,"Gold nanoparticles stabilized on metal oxide supports have found a wide range of applications especially in heterogeneous catalysis and gas sensing. A facile methodology for the in situ electrodecoration of gold nanoparticles on metal oxide supports is presented herein. Metal oxides such as indium oxide (In2O3) and zirconia (ZrO2) nanoparticles are first prepared via the sol–gel route. Subsequently, gold nanoparticles are electrodeposited in situ on the surface of these metal oxides using a modified sacrificial Au-anode electrolysis procedure. Both pristine as well as electrodecorated metal oxides are characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning and transmission electron microscopies (SEM, TEM). SEM images of electrodecorated metal oxides reveal successful deposition of gold nanoparticles on metal oxide supports. XPS shows that nano-sized gold is significantly available on the materials' surface and it is in the elemental oxidation state. Moreover, it is found that the electrodecoration of gold nanoparticles on metal oxide surfaces proceeds as a function of the concentration of hydroxyl groups on the surface of metal oxide supports."
927,Preparation and characterization of novel cationic–nonionic organo-montmorillonite,2015-06-01,"With cationic and nonionic surfactants cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and alkylphenol ethoxylates (OP-10) as modifiers, a novel cationic–nonionic organo-montmorillonite (OMt-CTAB-OP-10) was afforded for the first time, and compared the properties of OMt-CTAB-OP-10 with those of cationic organo-montmorillonite (OMt-CTAB) and nonionic organo-montmorillonite (OMt-OP-10). The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) prove CTAB and OP-10 has intercalated into Ca-Mt layers. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicate OMt-CTAB-OP-10 exhibited better properties such as larger d 001 value, better heat resistance, and larger expansion degree. Moreover, OMt-CTAB-OP-10 showed better dispersion property and high surface polarity, which was proved by contact angle analyses and sedimentation experiments. The surface polarity of OMt-CTAB-OP-10 was higher than that of OMt-CTAB. In high polar solvent, the dispersion and stability of OMt-CTAB-OP-10 were superior to that of OMt-CTAB."
928,Cytotoxicity and antibacterial efficacy of silver nanoparticles deposited onto dopamine-functionalised titanium,2015-06-01,"Silver (Ag) has become an attractive antibacterial agent because of its high level of activity against a broad spectrum of bacterial and fungal species. In this study, silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were formed by reducing Ag ions with NaBH4 and then deposited onto the surface of a dopamine-functionalised titanium (Ti) plate to improve the antibacterial properties of Ag. The Ag NPs, which had an average size of 20 nm, were uniformly distributed on the surface of the plate. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that the binding energy peaks at 367.4 and 374.4 eV correspond to Ag (0). No additional Ag compounds were detected during this process. The Raman spectra of DOPA-Ti and Ag-DOPA-Ti illustrated that the Ag deposition induced the downshift of the Raman spectrum and was accompanied by a decrease in the intensities of almost all the bands. The zeta potentials of the pristine and dopamine-modified Ti were negative but became positive after the Ag NPs were deposited onto the DOPA-Ti surface. Although the Ag NPs inhibited the proliferation of Vero cells within 24 h, cell viability greater than 70% could be preserved. After incubation with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli for 24 h, the Ag-DOPA-Ti exhibited remarkable antibacterial activity, whereas Ti and DOPA-Ti did not show obvious antibacterial potential. The simple combination of dopamine and Ag NP deposition improved the biocompatibility. This technique can easily be replicated by researchers for the development of antibacterial implants."

The prepared nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDX) and UV-Vis. diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) techniques. Photocatalytic inactivation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) was investigated on the nanocomposites under visible-light irradiation. Among the prepared nanocomposites, the sample with 0.237 mole fraction of AgBr exhibits the highest activity. The inactivation rate constant on the nancomposite is about 2.3 and 1.9-fold greater than for the ZnO and AgBr nanoparticles, respectively. The inactivation rate constant increases with weight of the photocatalyst up to 0.5 g/L and then decreases. Moreover, the rate constant increases with pH of solution up to 8.4 and then decreases. Influence of various scavengers demonstrates that holes play a vital role in achieving well inactivation of E. coli. In addition, no remarkable bacterial colony can be detected within 96 h after the inactivation which reveals that the photocatalytic inactivation leads to almost an irreversible damage of the bacteria. Finally, the photocatalyst retains more that 70% of its activity after seven cycles."

The optical properties of the prepared glass samples were measured by using high precision Elipsometer and UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The theoretical analysis for electronic polarizability, oxide ion polarizability and optical basicity were determined by using Lorentz–Lorenz equation on the basis of refractive index and optical band gap energy. It is observed that there is a linear increasing trend of electronic polarizability with increasing content of erbium nanoparticles. The oxide ion polarizability increases with refractive index and decreases with band gap energy. The optical basicity analysis shows that the glass samples possess high basicity."
931,Facile synthesis and optimization of ZnSe–GSH quantum dots by hydrothermal method,2015-06-01,"Water-soluble ZnSe quantum dots (QDs) with high luminescence were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method using selenium powder and zinc acetate solution as precursors, and L-glutathione (GSH) as a stabilizer. In addition, the photoluminescence properties of ZnSe QDs under different conditions (precursor ratios, precursor solution pH, and hydrothermal temperature) were thoroughly investigated. The morphology and structure of as-synthesized ZnSe–GSH QDs under optimized experimental conditions were determined by HRTEM, XRD, and TG-DTA. Results showed that the ZnSe–GSH QDs were tiny nanocrystals with quasi-sphere particles of ∼3 nm size with core–shell structure. The formation and growth mechanism of the core–shell structure were discussed in detail. When the synthesis process was carried out under optimized hydrothermal conditions (reaction temperature, 140 °C; reaction time, 45 min; pH value of precursor solution, 10.0; GSH-to-Zn mole ratio, 1.2; and Se-to-Zn mole ratio, 0.2), the as-synthesized ZnSe–GSH QDs emitted blue-purple fluorescence (375 nm) when excited at 321 nm."
932,Magnesium doped ZnO nanostructures synthesis using  extracts: Structural and field electron emission properties,2015-06-01,"We report here the field electron emission performance of pure ZnO and Mg doped ZnO nanostructures prepared on aluminium substrates using Citrus Aurantifolia by the sol–gel method. XRD analysis confirmed that the pure ZnO and Mg-doped ZnO nanostructures were polycrystalline with the hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure. Based on EDX analysis, the Mg atomic percentage incorporated in the ZnO samples increased with increasing Mg concentration during synthesis. With Mg doping, the field electron emission performance was significantly affected possibly due to increase in electrical conductivity with doping level. The turn-on electric field values for ZnO nanostructures decreased as dopant concentration increased with values of 6.99, 6.35, 6.07 and 5.99 V/μm for pure ZnO, and 3, 5, and 10 mol% Mg-doped ZnO nanostructures respectively. Almost similar trend was observed for the threshold electric field values of 9.16, 9.17, 8.62 and 8.49 V/μm for pure ZnO, and 3, 5, and 10 mol% Mg-doped ZnO nanostructures, respectively. Field enhancement factor, β, showed no significant trend and was comparable for all samples mainly due to the similar geometrical features of the samples. Emission currents up to a few mAs and with good stability obtained with Mg doping are potentially applicable in field emission technology."
933,Immersion enthalpies in different liquids of activated carbons modified by surface chemistry,2015-06-01,"Activated carbons were modified by chemical oxidation and thermal reduction at different temperatures with the aim of changing the chemical group's concentration according to the thermal stability of the groups obtained by oxidation treatment with nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. The solids were characterized by physisorption of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, and immersion calorimetry in benzene, dichloromethane and water were determined. The experimental results showed changes in B.E.T area values and micropore volumes between 783 and 935 m2 · g–1 and 0.31 and 0.37 cm3 · g–1. The immersion enthalpies in dichloromethane obtained were greater which were found at a range of –96.00 to –155 J · g–1 followed by enthalpies in benzene in the range –94.98 to –145.1, and values for immersion in water between –32.00 and –66.00 J · g–1. From these results, energy characteristics were calculated by applying the Dubinin–Raduskevich and Stoeckli–Krahenbüehl models to the experimental data of N2 adsorption and benzene immersion, respectively. The results showed a good correlation, which demonstrates the validity of the calorimetric technique used for the determination of the energetic characteristics of the studied solids. The result is interesting because it is lower than that calculated for the interaction between solids and benzene, and this is evidence that the changes of material affect the enthalpic characteristics."
934,A comparative study of type A and type B gelatin nanoparticles as the controlled release carriers for different model compounds,2015-06-01,"This study aimed to compare type A (GA) and type B gelatin (GB) nanoparticles in terms of physico-chemical properties and the release behavior of different model compounds (methylene blue, eosin, and sericin) incorporated in both nanoparticles. The GA and GB nanoparticles (397–501 nm in diameter) were successfully fabricated by water in oil emulsion technique following by the glutaraldehyde crosslinking. GB nanoparticles showed the higher crosslinking degree, consequently resulted in the slower degradation rate than the GA nanoparticles. The model compounds having different charge characteristics including the positive-charged methylene blue and the negative-charged eosin, were loaded in the nanoparticles. We found that the entrapment and loading efficiencies of methylene blue and eosin depended upon the type of gelatin nanoparticles. The positive-charged methylene blue could entrap in the negative-charged GB nanoparticles at the high entrapment and loading efficiencies (92% and 46%, respectively), possibly due to their attractive electrostatic interaction. Correspondingly, the negative-charged eosin would repel the GB nanoparticles which had the same charge, resulted in the low entrapment and loading efficiencies (25% and 12%, respectively). On the other hand, the entrapment and loading efficiencies of sericin, a model of active compound, in the nanoparticle could not be explained by the electrostatic interaction. The negative-charged GB nanoparticles could entrap the negative-charged sericin at the high extent. The different profiles of methylene blue, eosin and sericin released from the GA and GB nanoparticles were obtained. The release profiles of methylene blue and eosin were mainly influenced by the type of gelatin nanoparticles. The sericin-encapsulated nanoparticles were cultured with L929 cells in order to confirm the biological activities of sericin. The sericin-encapsulated nanoparticles and the control sericin at all sericin concentrations were not toxic to L929 cells. Interestingly, the cells cultured in the presence of GA and GB nanoparticles loaded with 8 mg/mL sericin produced the significant amount of collagen, compared to those cultured with pure sericin control. This was possibly due to that the sericin-encapsulated gelatin nanoparticles were uptaken by cells and target the intracellular signaling of collagen production. From this study, we suggested that the selection of type of gelatin nanoparticles would be very important to get the desired release profile of each compound. The data from this study would be useful for the application of gelatin nanoparticles in drug delivery system."

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) shows a unique pipe-like morphology of the as-synthesized BNMTs with thin wall structure and larger internal space. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey shows B 1s and N 1s peaks at 190.8 eV and 398.5 eV that represent hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) composition of synthesized microtubes. Raman spectroscopy demonstrates a peak at 1372.53 (cm–1) that corresponds to E 2g mode of h-BN."

The optimal doping concentration of Eu2+ is 2 mol% and the critical distance for energy transfer is determined to be 19.49 Å. By utilizing a mixture of blue-emitting CSAS:Eu2+, green-emitting SrSi2O2N2:Eu2+ and red-emitting CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ phosphors as light converters, an intense white GaN-based n-UV-LED (370 nm) was fabricated to exhibit good color-rendering index R a of as high as 87.98 at correlated color temperature of 5537 K and CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.42).

The photolithography is used to fabricate the periodic patterns of Si pillar arrays with two different widths/periods: 2 μm/5 μm and 2 μm/7 μm at constant depth (1.1 μm). A transparent and antireflective ITO coated Si pillar arrays are achieved at a room temperature and then subjected to rapid thermal process at 300 °C for 10 min. The reflectance of 2/5 pillar patterns revealed the lower value of 14.4% than that of 2/7 pillar patterns (reflectance of 25.8%). The photoresponse of fabricated heterojunction device is enhanced in response with surficial length. The highest photoresponse ratios of 1656% and 1556% are observed for prepared devices at a wavelength of 900 nm. These results confirmed that the improved photoresponse is observed by surficial length enhancement. Therefore, the fabricated ITO coated Si heterojunction play an important role in photovoltaic devices."

Ball milled powders were subjected to various characterization techniques viz., X-ray diffraction, Scanning electron microscopy with an Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Transmission electron microscopy. Effect of Al and Nb substitution on the inter-planar shift and its corresponding implications on lattice strain, crystallite size and unit cell volume of Mg2 Ni compound were also discussed. Activation energy of the milled powders was calculated using Kissinger analysis. Mg67 Ni33 powder exhibit lower activation energy than others. Cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and charge–discharge studies were done on the developed electrode materials. Increasing Al substitution for Mg increases the cycling stability of electrode materials from 68 (x = 0) to 77% (x = 5)."

The samples were separately characterized by Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed the as-obtained V6 O13 consisted of a large quantity of uniform nanobelts with the typical length up to several micrometers, width about 150 - 250 nm, and thicknesses about 20 - 40 nm on average. It was found that oxalic acid played a crucial role in controlling the formation of phase-pure V6 O13. The influence of V6 O13 nanobelts on the thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP) was investigated by the Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis and Differential Thermal Analysis (TGA/DTA). The thermal decomposition temperatures of AP in the presence of 1, 3, 5 and 10 wt% of V6 O13 nanobelts were reduced by 41, 67, 85 and 97 C, respectively. The results indicated that the adding amount of V6 O13 nanobelts had greater influence on the thermal decomposition of AP, and this material had better effect in decomposition of AP as compared with other vanadium oxides."

The morphology, structure, and electromagnetic properties of PBC/Fe3 O4 nanocomposite were investigated. It is found that the Fe3 O4 nanoparticles with a size of only about 5.4 ± 0.7 nm are highly dispersed on the surface of PBC nanofibers after surface oxidization. The PBC/Fe3 O4 nanocomposite exhibits extraordinary microwave absorption properties with a minimum reflection loss (RL) of– 62.1 dB at 9.12 GHz with a thickness of 3.4 mm. Furthermore, the bandwidth of RL less than –10 dB can reach 5.92 GHz with a matching thickness of 2.5 mm.

943,Control of AlN single crystal nucleation: An insight into the crystal growth habit in the initial stages of the physical vapor transport method,2015-04-01,"The nucleation of AlN single crystals was investigated by heterogeneous nucleation theory, and by physical vapor transport experiments on tungsten (W) and tantalum (Ta) substrates in the temperature range of 2150– 2250 C. The theoretical analysis showed that AlN nucleation readily occurred on the substrate surface where the heterogeneous nucleation energy of AlN crystal was low. The morphologies, crystal structure and chemical compositions of AlN grains were characterized using laser scanning confocal microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. This revealed that the nucleation density on the W substrate was higher than that on the Ta substrate, and the grains were distributed in rows along concavities on both scrubbed W and Ta substrate surfaces. It was found that at the initial stages of crystal growth, the number of nuclei and the nucleation site can be controlled by varying the substrate type and morphology which will further influence the crystal growth from nucleation point to the final crystal."

Friction and wear behaviors were evaluated on M-2000 tester. The results show that the friction coefficient of the fiber-UHMWPE composites is lower than pure UHMWPE, with a minimum value of 0.250 of reinforced samples with 50 wt% content of long fiber. The samples with 50 wt% content of fiber also show a better performance on wear resistance than others with the wear rate of 1.886 × 10–7mg ˙ m –1N–1. SEM morphology of worn surface reveals that adhesive wear is the main wear mechanism for pure UHMWPE which also has a small size of wear debris. Correspondingly, the wear pattern of fiber-UHMWPE composites is fatigue wear and big size of wear debris is formed during the sliding process."
946,"Structure and characterization of the sputtered ZnO, Al-doped ZnO, Ti-doped ZnO and Ti, Al-co-doped ZnO thin films",2015-04-01,"Transparent conductive thin films such as ZnO, Al-doped ZnO (AZO), Ti-doped ZnO (TZO), and Ti, Al-codoped ZnO (TAZO) were prepared on the STN glass substrate by radio frequency sputtering. The thickness of as-prepared films was approximately 700 nm and the concentration of dopants was controlled by adjusting the electrical power of sputtering. Results from X-ray diffraction patterns clearly showed that all samples were in wurtzite structure with (002) preferential orientation. They all possessed smooth surfaces with the mixture of column and core texture as indicated by the field emission scanning electronic microscope analyses. The average transmittance ranging from 400 to 800 nm wavelength, determined by means of UV-visible spectra, TAZO (93%) was higher than AZO (90%), TZO (91%), and ZnO (86%). Electrical resistivity determined by four-point probe followed the order of TAZO (0.91 m cm) < AZO (3.61 m cm) - TZO (3.84 m cm) ZnO (289 m cm). Observed lower resistivity of TAZO was likely attributed to the high density of crystal defects i. e., stacking faults as indicated by the high resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses."

Although, the wound healing properties of AgNPs through green synthesis were less reported. In the present study, green synthesized AgNPs were incorporated in Pluronic F127 gels as a delivery system to evaluate their wound healing potentiality. Interestingly, the wound healing activity of 0.1% w/w (AgNPs) in Pluronic F127 gels was enhanced to a considerable extent which could be corroborated by increased amount of hydroxylproline content (2.39 ± 0.28 μg/mL), wound tensile strength (33.41 ± 2.38 N/cm2, and wound closure time, which were quite higher than other treated groups. Histopathology and biochemical tests did not show any inflammation, however, the amount of collagen production was increased in the group treated by 0.1% w/w AgNPs in Pluronic F127 gels."

951,Determination of optical constants of poly(-phthalimidomethyl methacrylate),2015-02-01,"The polymer of N-phthalimidomethyl methacrylate (PNPMMA) was synthesized by free radical polymerization. The poly(PNPMMA) is significant material, because it is a soluble material. The poly(PNPMMA) exhibits a low transmittance behavior in the visible region. The band gap of the poly(PNPMMA) thin film was found to be 1.62 eV. The refractive index value of the poly(PNPMMA) varies between 3.00 and 1.56. The plot of refractive index is composed of two regions so-called normal and abnormal dispersion. We calculated many optical parameters such as average transmittance, absorption band edge, refractive index, incidence and refraction angle, direct and indirect band gap, real and imaginary parts of dielectric constant, real part and imaginary parts of the optical conductivity of the poly(PNPMMA). The poly(PNPMMA) is a semiconductor and it can be used in the fabrication of the metal-semiconductor (MS) contacts like Schottky diode due to low optical band gap and suitable optical contacts and it is significant material in applications of some devices such as an image sensor packaging structure and high intensity medium-pressure lamps due to low transmittance values in the visible region."
952,Fluorescence enhancement study of shell-less CdTe quantum dots,2015-02-01,"We report a systematic study on the synthesis of shell-less CdTe quantum dots towards the enhancement of their luminescence properties. Reaction times and Cd:Te molar ratios were investigated to optimize the synthesis conditions. It was found that these parameters have a significant influence on the quantum dots emission wavelengths and photoluminescence quantum yields. The synthesis can be carried out without the use of an inert atmosphere and pyrophoric ligands in less than an hour. Water-soluble CdTe quantum dots were also prepared by modification of CdTe/ODE with mercaptopropionic acid. Hydrophobic and water-soluble quantum dots were characterized by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The optical stability of hydrophobic and hydrophilic quantum dots was tested irradiating the sample with a high power xenon lamp. After 45 min of illumination the hydrophobic-materials showed an excellent stability (bleaching < 10%) and the hydrophilic-materials a non-reversible photo-enhancement process. After 15 minutes of stopping the illumination, the quantum yield of hydrophilic quantum dots in aqueous solution was stabilized to 55%.

One of these compounds is hydroxyapatite (HAp). In this regard, numerous strategies have been designed to increase the structural properties of HA. Consequently, in the present study, magnesium (Mg2+) ions were incorporated to HA using wet chemical precipitation route in order to form the MgxHAp. In this experiment, Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, (NH4)2HPO4 and Mg(NO3)2·6H2O were used as starting raw materials. The obtained powders were characterized utilizing X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The X-ray results demonstrated that the addition of Mg2+ ions into apatite lattice has decreased the degree of crystallinity in the samples. Moreover, the agglomeration of powders were slightly increased in the presence of Mg2+ ions. The effect of different amounts of Mg2+ ions on biological properties of samples were assessed using cellular proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and gene expression. The cellular behavior of MG-63 cells was improved in Mg2+ incorporated samples. Finally, the results indicated that the high amounts of Mg2+ in HAp, could improve the cellular behavior in comparison with pure HAp."
954,Enhanced amorphous-silicon solar cell efficiency through a wet etched aluminum-doped ZnO pattern replication using direct printing lithography,2015-02-01,"To generate a high degree of scattering at the front transparent conductive oxide of amorphous silicon thin film solar cells, aluminum-doped zinc oxide films were wet etched using an acidic solution. Unfortunately, the sharp protrusions and deep valleys on these textured surfaces can cause defects. Therefore, a random nanomicro pattern was first formed on a glass substrate using a nanoimprint lithography technique; then a thick aluminum-doped zinc oxide layer was deposited atop this, covering the rough surface such that its surface is smoother than that of the patterned glass substrate, allowing for the growth of good quality thin film solar cells. The random nano-micro pattern on the glass substrate scatters the incident light, increasing its path length and probability of light absorption, enhancing the short circuit current density and power conversion efficiency. The solar cells deposited on the aluminum-doped zinc oxide/nano-micro patterns demonstrated an increased short circuit current without any reduction in either the open circuit voltage or fill factor. Relative to an aluminum-doped zinc oxide/flat glass substrate, the short circuit current and power conversion efficiency enhancement of a solar cell on an aluminum-doped zinc oxide/nano-micro patterned glass substrate increased by 8.2% and 12.7%, respectively."

These polypyrrole/SPB (PPy/SPB) composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy and four probe method. SEM and TEM images have showed that the PPy was uniformly coated on the surface of SPB. FTIR spectrometry has indicated the interaction between the SPB and PPy. Raman spectroscopy has revealed that the bipolaron content of PPy/SPB composites was higher than PPy, leading to a higher conductivity. The electrical conductivity of the PPy/SPB composites at room temperature was 10.3 S/cm, which was far higher than 4.2 S/cm for PPy."

Complex dislocations are a combination of two types or more of individual dislocations and have been less studied. Here, we report the characterization and the formation mechanism of a complex dislocation consisting of one BPD and two TEDs in 6H-SiC single crystals. Our experimental results show that this type of complex dislocations can occur frequently in single crystals as in epitaxial films. We reveal that it originates from an interaction of a TED and a BPD. This interaction is likely to induce the emergence of a new TED."

There are very few 'multiferroic' materials that exhibit both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic (leaving others like ferroelastic, etc.) properties, but the 'magneto-electric' coupling of magnetic and electrical properties is a more general and widespread phenomenon. Here we report a new double perovskite Bi2FeMoO6, which exhibit excellent co-existence of ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity. The results show that this material would be a promising candidate for using in devices that requires multifunctional operations."
958,Effect of Ge content on the synthesis and structure of Ge-ITQ-13 zeolite,2015-02-01,"A series of Ge-ITQ-13 zeolites with Si/Ge molar ratio from 10 to 40 were synthesized and characterized with XRD, IR, FE-SEM, and 29Si MAS NMR techniques. The results verified that almost of all the Ge atoms in the synthesis gel was incorporated into the ITQ-13 framework. Ge plays a structure-directing role in the crystallization process as a result of facilitating formation of double four-membered ring structural units. As a consequence, ITQ-13 zeolites can be synthesized with the synthesis gel having a high content of H2O in the presence of Ge. 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy shows that the incorporated Ge atoms are not randomly distributed in the Ge-ITQ-13 framework but selectively occupy certain lattice sites."

960,Fabrication of CdS bound pyrazole carboxamide conjugated nanoassemblies and their applications,2014-12-01,"In this work, a new family of nanoassemblies were developed by conjugating the pyrazole-based moiety 4-Amino-1-methyl-3-n-propyl-5-pyrazolecarboxamide (AMP) with the chelating agent1,3-diamino-2hydroxypropane-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid (TTA). By altering the ratio of AMP added, three conjugates were synthesized. Each of those conjugates were self-assembled at varying pH values to promote the growth of higher order supramolecular structures. The results showed that growth was pH dependent as well as dependent on the ratio of AMP to TTA utilized to form the conjugates. While under acidic conditions, primarily nanofibers were observed, under basic conditions, nanovesicles were formed. Due to the chelating ability of the conjugates, CdS nanoparticles were then grown on the assemblies. The hybrid CdS nanoparticle-bound assemblies showed distinct anti-fungal activity as well as cytotoxicty toward HeLa cells. Thus we have developed a new family of supramolecular assemblies with potential applications in biosensors or in environmental monitoring."
961,Microstructure characteristics of copper single layer and copper/titanium multilayer coatings: Nanomechanical properties and bactericidal activities,2014-12-01,"The bacterial infections associated with metallic surfaces in the clinical environments obviously lead to vulnerable diseases. A protective layer on these surfaces is imperative, so as to reduce the risk of infections due to microbes. From this perspective, the Cu based single layer and multilayer coatings were grown on 316L stainless steel (SS) and titanium substrates by the DC magnetron sputtering technique. These coatings were characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), atomic force microscope (AFM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). The evaluation of nanomechanical properties, surface wettability and antimicrobial efficacy of the coatings was also carried out in detail. The antimicrobial properties of the coatings were studied against Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus) by two methods: disc diffusion method and fluorescence staining. The single layer Cu coating at 200 ?C and [Cu/Ti]25 multilayer coatings on both substrates exhibited enhanced antimicrobial activity. However, the nanomechanical properties were found to be four times higher for the multilayers than for the single layer coatings."

The structure and morphology were characterized by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The role of Ar as feed gas and interaction between methanol and brass have been predicted based on work reported elsewhere. Photoluminescence (PL) properties of un-doped and Mn-doped ZnO showed significant changes in the optical properties providing evidence for several types of defects such as zinc interstitials (Zn i ), oxygen interstitials (O i ), zinc vacancy (V Zn ), singly charged zinc vacancy (V–  Zn ), oxygen vacancy (V o ), singly charged oxygen vacancy (V+  o ) and oxygen antisite defects (O Zn ) in the grown NS.

The modified chitosan membranes were systemati- cally characterized using scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction; the observations showed that the addition and removal of glycerin did not obviously influence the surface morphology or thermal stability of the chitosan membranes. Furthermore, water vapor sorption experiments revealed that the equilibrium water content in the modified chitosan membranes was increased slightly as compared to that in the pure chitosan membrane. The addition and removal of glyc- erin impacted the water vapor permeance of the chitosan membranes. When the glycerin content exceeded 80 wt%, the water vapor permeance of the composite membranes was higher than that of the pure chitosan membrane."

Ethyl vinayl acetate (EVA) terpolymer grafted with maleic anhydride (MAH) to get EVA-g-MAH. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra shows two new absorbance peaks at 1779 and 1851 cm–1, which correspond to symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching virbrations of MAH carbonyl (C = O) group and the grafting ratio was calculated through chemical titration method.

967,Linear and nonlinear optical susceptibilities of bilayer graphene,2014-12-01,"The linear and nonlinear optical susceptibilities of bilayer pristine graphene (BLPG) and H2S single molecule adsorbed at three different sites on a single graphene sheet of BLPG are calculated to obtain further insight into the electronic properties. Calculations show that the adsorption of H2S on the bridge and top sites open a gap around the Fermi level, while adsorption of H2S on the hollow site closes the energy gap, resulting in significant changes in the linear and nonlinear optical susceptibilities. This is attributed to the fact that the adsorbed H2S onto a single graphene sheet of BLPG cause significant changes in the electronic structure. The calculated linear optical susceptibilities show a huge anisotropy confirming that the graphene has unusual and interesting optical properties. We find that the absorption spectrum of graphene is quite flat extending from 300–2500 nm with an absorption peak in the UV region (~ 270 nm), which is in excellent agreement with the experimental data. The pristine graphene shows a strong saturable absorption because of a large absorption and Pauli blocking. We have calculated the nonlinear optical susceptibilities of BLPG and the three configurations and found that they possess a huge second harmonic generation. We have also calculated the microscopic hyperpolarizability, βijk , for BLPG."

In this work, a series of Ce3+/Tb3+ co-doped KBaY(BO3)2 samples have been synthesized via a traditional high temperature solid-state reaction. The crystal structure and luminescence properties, especially the energy transfer behavior from Ce3+ to Tb3+, are discussed in detail. The energy transfer from Ce3+ to Tb3+ in the KBaY(BO3)2 host have been demonstrated to be resonant type via a dipole–dipole interaction mechanism and the critical distance of energy transfer was calculated to be 13.84 Å based on the concentration quenching theory. Tunable emission from blue to cyan, and eventually to green was realized by controlling the dopant content of the Ce3+/Tb3+ ions."
970,Mechanism and efficiency of methylene blue degradation by microwave-induced birnessites with different Mn average oxidation states,2014-12-01,"The degradation of methylene blue (MB) in simulated wastewater by microwave-induced birnessites (MIB) with different Mn average oxidation states (AOS) via a catalytic oxidation process was investigated. XRD, UV-vis, LC-MS, XPS and spin moment calculation were conducted to investigate the degradation mechanism and process. The results showed that the removal efficiency and removal amount were 99.4% and 49.7 mg/g after 30 min degradation of MB by MIB with sole Mn AOS during a kinetic study. Absorbance peaks of the products had a ""blue shift"" and the gradual degradation of MB resulted in the formation of C14H13N2OS, C13H11N2OS, C12H8NO2S and C12H9N2 OS according to LC-MS. With the experiment of MB by MIB over different Mn AOS, the lower Mn AOS of birnessites contributed to the higher degradation efficiency. The Mn3+/Mn4+ ratios increased from Bir1 to Bir6, which indicated the Mn AOS of Birnessite enhanced according to the XPS analysis. And computational work on birnessite through CASTEP was further conducted to demonstrate that Mn3+ in [MnO6] octahedron has higher spin magnetic moment than that Mn4+."

972,Low temperature and broadband dielectric properties of VO doped MgTiO ceramics,2014-10-01,"The liquid phase effect of V2O5 on the densification, microstructure and microwave dielectric properties of Mg2TiO4 (MTO) ceramics has been investigated. The addition of V2O5 significantly lowered the sintering temperature compared to pure MTO ceramics with improved microstructure, relative density and microwave dielectric properties. The increase in relative density and average grain size via growth of large grains and dissolution of small grains is explained by Ostwald ripening phenomena. Further, the microwave dielectric properties of the pure and MTO with V2O5 samples were measured at cryogenic temperatures. It was observed that the loss tangent (tan ) and Q × f o of pure MTO increased with temperature, whereas the loss tangent and Q × f o of the samples with V2O5 decreased with a rise in temperature. However, the MTO ceramics added with 0.5 and 1.0 wt% of V2O5 manifested slightly higher loss tangents as compared to the pure MTO ceramics. The mechanism of the microwave loss is in agreement with the theory of intrinsic dielectric loss derived from the two phonon difference process. Further, the distinctive loss peak at 40 K is attributed to the orientation polarization having dispersion at the microwave frequency. The addition of V2O5 did not cause any changes on the temperature stability of the MTO ceramics, whereas the temperature coefficient of the permittivity increases with an increase in temperature. The broadband dielectric measurement reveals that the V2O5 doping increases the dielectric constant and enhances the stability over a wide frequency range, and shows a peak around 1.8 GHz. The tan of pure MTO still shows the peak whereas the samples doped with V2O5 suppresses this peak significantly."

Nanoparticles were used recently as drug delivery agents and have shown increase in the efficacy of PDT. In this study we have used gold nanoparticles as a potential drug delivery agent in enhancing the photodynamic efficacy. Glutathione (GSH) capped gold nanoparticles were synthesized by immobilizing the thiol group of the GSH on to the surface of the gold nanoparticles. Rosebengal, a hydrophilic photosensitizer was conjugated to the amine group of the bounded GSH. These synthesized rosebengal conjugated gold nanoparticles were characterized using FT-IR spectroscopy for confirmation of the complex formation. Further, studies on the absorption, emission and lifetime of the nanocomplexes-show significant changes due to the formation of the complex. The PDT efficacy of these nanocomplexes and sensitizer alone were studied against Vero and HeLa cell lines. The phototoxicity results shows the nanocomplexes are more phototoxic than that of the free rosebengal where the covalent complex being the better of the nanocomplex."

Elemental analysis and energy dispersive X-ray analysis spectroscopy (EDX) confirm the presence of carbon and inclusion of La3+ ions in the grown crystals. Surface morphology of grown crystals was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were carried out. The lattice parameters established the presence of triclinic P crystal system. Effect of La3+ dopant concentration on centrosymmetric PMA and the crystalline nature of the prepared samples were confirmed by structural analysis. Functional groups were identified using FTIR and transparency of the crystals was compared by UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopic technique. The second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency of crystals from the Kurtz-Perry experiment was found to be 1.649 times for LP11 and 1.489 times for LP43 more with that of potassium di hydrogen phosphate (KDP). The Vicker's micro hardness value was found to be 45.9 kg/mm2 for LP11 and 75.5 kg/mm2 for LP43 for a load of 100 gm.

As received fly ash surface has modified through beneficiation and milling process. Various characterization studies were conducted to understand the applicability of milled fly ash in polymer composite applications and to understand its structural changes in surface morphology. The particle size distribution curves of milled fly ash showed the narrow size distribution and a mean particle size of below 1 μm with three hours of milling. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of fly ash as a function of milling time have been studied and found that quartz crystallite size was reduced to 29 nm from 36 nm. The peak broadening and decreased intensity at 26.7° 2 represents the breakdown of quartz phase during milling. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of milled fly ash showed the increased reactivity of fly ash with the formation of silanol groups on the surface. The morphological changes in fly ash surface with milling were monitored through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The modified fly ash filled polypropylene composite has shown better mechanical properties and hence, suggesting the effective utilization of modified fly ash in polymer composite applications."
977,Preparation of TiO nanopaint using ball milling process and investigation on its antibacterial properties,2014-10-01,"The development of nanomaterials based antibacterial coatings has received considerable attention towards the control and prevention of healthcare associated infections (HAIs). In this article, we are reporting the preparation of titanium oxide (TiO2) nanopaint by embedding the TiO2 nanoparticles in alkyd resin matrix (with other suitable non-toxic additives) using ball milling process. The Fourier transform-infra red spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope analysis revealed the incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles in the alkyd resin matrix of the paint. The TiO2 nanopaint coatings are examined for their antibacterial properties against different types of bacterial strains viz. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The experimental results showed that the TiO2 nanopaint coated surfaces inhibited about 85%, 90% and 76% of microbial population against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA, respectively. We believe that our efforts ensure the potential applications of the TiO2 nanopaint in the prevention of HAIs."
978,Quasi-particle dispersion and density of states in superconducting state of iron pnictide system,2014-10-01,"The present work deals with a theoretical analysis of quasi-particle energy spectrum and density of electronic states in iron pnictide superconductors. The tight binding model Hamiltonian containing various orbital hopping energies, onsite electronic Coulomb correlations and Hund's coupling in Fe 3d orbitals has been used. The expressions of quasi-particle energies and density of states are obtained within mean-field approximation of Green's function equation of motion approach. On the basis of numerical computation, we observed a band splitting into two well separated peaks above and below the Fermi energy in the electronic spectra. On increasing the nearest neighbor hopping, the density of states in superconducting state show enhancement of gap due to sharpening of quasi-particle peak well below and above the Fermi level. While on increasing next neighbor hopping, both the spectral peaks above and below the Fermi level show sharp increase in the spectral weight. On increasing the anisotropy in Coulomb correlations, the quasi-particle energy peak in the spectra show prominent features and support in estabilizing the superconducting state in the presence of anisotropic Coulomb correlations in iron pnictides. Finally, the theoretically obtained quasi-particle energy spectrum and density of states in iron pnictides has been viewed in terms of recent photoemission ARPES and STM data."
979,Acetosulfation of bacterial cellulose: An unexplored promising incipient candidate for highly transparent thin film,2014-10-01,"The rising consciousness about the benefits of environment friendly and biodegradable materials demand a substitute for the prevailing non-degradable and toxic materials. Towards this aspect bacterial cellulose (BC) has numerous potential applications owing to their vital properties like high biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ecofriendly nature. In the present study, we have synthesized BC using Komagataeibacter sucrofermentans strain through batch fermentation and functionalized it with sulfate groups to form bacterial cellulose sulfate (BCS) that has negligible reports so far. Using this BCS, we have synthesized a highly transparent film by drop casting method, which exhibited high optical transmittance of 90–92% in the visible wavelength range. BCS was thoroughly characterized using SEM and AFM for its surface morphology. The XPS, FTIR, TGA and XRD studies were performed to confirm the successful sulfonation, stability and crystallinity of BC and BCS. The film morphology, surface roughness and mechanical properties were monitored using SEM, AFM, and Instron universal testing machine. The results confirm smooth surface with good integrity and mechanical properties of the BCS film. Furthermore, cell viability studies confirmed the biocompatible nature of the sample. Owing to these salient features, BCS films hold tremendous potential in the field of biomedicine, optoelectronics as well as food packaging."
980,Tunable optoelectronic properties of sol–gel derived ZnO nanostructure thin film by annealing treatment,2014-10-01,"ZnO thin films were deposited using spin-coating sol gel technique. The deposited films were annealed in furnace at 400 to 600 °C and characterized for studying the structural, morphological, optical, photoluminescence and electrical properties. X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that the crystallite size and grain boundary size between ZnO particles increased with increasing the annealing temperature. The UV-Vis spectroscopy and photoluminescence studies indicated that the 500 °C annealed film exhibited the highest transparency (>90%) in visible range and the brightest blue emission when compared to other annealed films. The 400 °C annealed film exhibited the lowest resistivity of 5.56 × 10–2 Ω cm and the turn on voltage of OLEDs is 2.5 V when using ZnO based electrode.

981,Synthesis and characterization of three-dimensional porous graphene oxide/sodium alginate scaffolds with enhanced mechanical properties,2014-10-01,"Three-dimensional (3D) porous graphene oxide/sodium alginate (GO/SA) composite scaffolds were fabricated by a facile and eco-friendly method involving solution mixing and freeze drying. The obtained GO/SA scaffolds were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The porosity, water absorption, and compressive properties were also examined. FTIR analysis confirms the existence of hydrogen bonding between SA and GO. SEM results reveal that the composite scaffolds still present highly porous and interconnected structure despite of the incorporation of GO. Importantly, the GO/SA composites show significant improvements in compressive strength and Young's modulus as compared to neat SA. It is demonstrated that the mechanically strong GO/SA composite scaffolds with highly porous and network structure may be a promising candidate for tissue engineering applications."

983,Recent progress in parallel fabrication of individual single walled carbon nanotube devices using dielectrophoresis,2014-08-01,"Single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have attracted immense research interest because of their remarkable physical and electronic properties. In particular, electronic devices fabricated using individual SWNT have shown outstanding device performance surpassing those of Si. However, for the widespread application of SWNTs based electronic devices, parallel fabrication techniques along with Complementary Metal Oxide (CMOS) compatibility are required. One technique that has the potential to integrate SWNTs at the selected position of the circuit in a parallel fashion is AC dielectrophoresis (DEP). In this paper, we review recent progress in the parallel fabrication of SWNT-based devices using DEP. The review begins with a theoretical background for the DEP and then discusses various parameters affecting DEP assembly of SWNTs. We also review the electronic transport properties of the DEP assembled devices and show that high performance devices can be fabricated using DEP. The technique for fabricating all semiconducting field effect transistor using DEP is also reviewed. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for the DEP assembly of SWNTs."
984,Benzimidazole based Ir(III) picolinate complexes as emitting materials and the fluorescent behavior of benzimidazole bound to Mn–TiO@ZnO core/shell nanospheres,2014-08-01,"Photophysical and electroluminescent studies of cyclometalated heteroleptic iridium(III) complexes have been carried out. The strongly allowed phosphorescence in these picolinate complexes is the result of significant spin-orbit coupling of the iridium center. The lowest energy of these picolinate complexes corresponds to a mixture of metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and π–π* states. Weak bands located at longer wavelength are due to the 1MLCT → S0 and 3MLCT → S0 transitions of iridium complexes. Devices show better performance in terms of brightness and moderate power and current efficiencies. Absorption, fluorescence and lifetime spectral studies have been made to probe the interaction of 2-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-1-phenyl1H-benzo[d]imidazole (TFMPPB) with sol–gel synthesised Mn-doped TiO2@ZnO core/shell, pristine ZnO and Mn-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. The emission of TFMPPB is enhanced by Mn-doped TiO2@ZnO core/shell, pristine ZnO and Mn-doped TiO2 nanoparticles which are likely due to lowering of LUMO and HOMO levels of the benzimidazole. Electron injection from photoexcited TFMPPB to the Mn–TiO2@ZnO CB(S* → S++e – CB) is likely to the reason for the fluorescence enhancement."
985,Preparation and characterization of Mg -ion conducting composite based on poly(vinyl alcohol) with various concentrations of LiO,2014-08-01,"In the present work, polymer electrolyte (PE) film consisting of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with magnesium bromide (MgBr2) as electrolytic salt, tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) as plasticizer and Li2O at different concentration (0.02, 0.04, 0.06 wt.%) as the filler has been prepared by solution casting technique. The polymeric film was flexible and self-standing with proper mechanical strength and studied for application in a solid-state rechargeable magnesium battery. The interactions between the filler and PVA chains are studied by X-ray and thermogravometric analyses. The conductivity increased with addition of filler reached to ∼10–5 S·cm–1 at 0.04 wt.% Li2O. The frequency dependence of ac conductivity obeys Jonscher power law. The estimated value of Mg+2 ion transference number is found to be 0.7 for high conducting film.

XRD, absorption spectra, and fluorescence spectra of these single crystals were studied. Enhanced mid-IR emission of 2.7 μm, and weakened up-conversion emission of 550 nm and down-conversion emission of 1.5 μm emission were observed in Er3+/Nd3+ co-doped LiLuF4 single crystals under an exciting light of 808 nm, as compared with Er3+ singly-doping. Meanwhile, Mid-IR emissions of 3.6 μm and 4.2 μm were also observed in Er3+/Nd3+ co-doped LiLuF4 single crystals. Energy transfer efficiencies between Nd3+ and Er3+ ions were calculated and the decay curves of the 1.06 μm for Nd3+ emission and 1.5 μm for Er3+ emission were analyzed with a modified Inokuti-Hirayama model. The large energy transfer efficiency of 95.6% and excellent optical properties indicate that this Er3+/Nd3+ co-doped LiLuF4 single crystal is a potential candidate for the applications in mid-IR laser."
987,Fabrication of a superhydrophobic etched copper–silver/stearic acid composite coating and evaluation of its friction-reducing and anticorrosion abilities,2014-08-01,"A copper substrate was etched in the mixed solution of (NH4)2S2O8 and HCl by oxidation-assisted surface acid etching process to generate a desired roughened structure (coded as etched Cu). Resultant etched Cu surface was then immersed in silver nitrate solution to allow incorporation of silver submicro-particles through replacement reaction to afford a lotus-leaf-like structure (denoted as etched Cu–Ag). Etched Cu–Ag surface was finally modified with stearic acid (abridged as STA) to provide etched Cu–Ag composite coating with superhydrophobicity (coded as etched Cu–Ag/STA). The morphology and microstructure of as-prepared etched Cu–Ag surface were observed with a field-emission scanning electron microscope, and its friction-reducing and anticorrosion abilities were evaluated in relation to water contact angle measurements. It was found that the as-prepared etched Cu–Ag surface is composed of micro-protrusions and submicro-mastoids with dual-scale structure similar to that of the lotus leaf. Besides, etched Cu–Ag/STA composite coating has a static water contact angle of 160.5 and shows very low adhesion for water droplet, and it possesses good friction-reducing ability. The evaluation of its anticorrosion ability indicates that the superhydrophobic surface has a certain anticorrosion ability against the solution whose pH values are within 5∼9. Moreover, the water contact angles (WCAs) of the superhydrophobic surface almost remain the same after immersion in the solution with different pH values, but its contact angle hysteresis values (CAHs) increase slightly thereafter. The method and results show potential application for protection of Cu substrate in engineering."
988,Microstructure and mechanical properties of ZrO–40 wt%AlO composite ceramics,2014-08-01,"The effects of the sintering temperature on the microstructure, crystalline phases and mechanical properties of the 3 mol% yttria-stabilized ZrO2–40 wt.%Al2O3 (abridged as 3YSZ–40 wt.%Al2O3) composites has been investigated. The monoclinic zirconia (m-ZrO2) phase has completely been transformed into tetragonal zirconia (t-ZrO2) phase for Al2O3 content. The presence of 3 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (3YSZ) particles on the grain boundaries effectively limits a rapid grain growth of the Al2O3 grains. The relative density and average grain size increased with increasing the sintering temperature. The maximum flexural strength of 395 MPa, Vickers hardness of 15.01 GPa and fracture toughness of 6.1 MPa · m1/2 was associated with the highly 99.4% dense homogeneous microstructure consisting of t-ZrO2 grains of the critical size, which makes it suitable for dental applications."
989,Room temperature luminescence properties of Pr  doped -PbF powders,2014-08-01,"Low cost cubic lead fluoride (β-PbF2) is an attractive light-emitting material for dual readout purpose in homogeneous hadronic calorimeter (HHCAL), and introducing available scintillation light in PbF2 is desperately needed. Among rare earth ions RE3+, Pr3+ ions usually show a unique fast and broad electric dipole allowed 5d–4f emission transition in luminescent inorganic materials. In this work, Pr3+ doped and Pr3+, Li+ co-doped β-PbF2 powders of Pb1– x  Pr x F2+α (x = 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 3%, 5%) and Pb0.995–  y Pr0.005Li y F2+β  (y = 0.3%, 0.5%, 1%, 3%, 5%) were synthesized by solid state reaction in vacuum tube furnace to obtain a fast light. Typical 4f–4f emission transitions of Pr3+ ions were observed under 3H4– 3P2 excitation in Pb1–  x Pr x F2+β  samples. Only 4f–4f emission transitions were observed under 4f–5d excitation because of the nonradiative relaxation of the 5d level into the lower 4f levels due to the low 4f–5d excitation transition energy (4.28 eV) of the Pr3+ ions in Pb1–  x Pr x F2+α  samples. The co-doping of monovalent Li ions can increase the luminescent intensity of Pr3+ ions in PbF2 host owing to the charge compensation. The decay time monitoring the 481 nm (under 4f–5d excitation) and 483 nm (under3H4-3P2 excitation) emission of Pr3+ ions in PbF2 host is 17.5 and 24.9 μs, respectively."
990,Unusual increase in the electric double-layer capacitance with charge–discharge cycles of nitrogen doped single-walled carbon nanotubes,2014-08-01,"Nitrogen-doping treatments using cyanamide as a nitrogen source have been done for several kinds of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). For SWCNT samples produced by chemical vapor deposition, N 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy peaks can be observed, and the atomic nitrogen doping percentage is estimated to be 1.8 at.%. It was found that the electric double-layer capacitance of the nitrogen-doped SWCNT sample is much larger than that of the pristine sample. Furthermore, the doped sample shows a better rate performance due to its smaller electric resistance. It should also be noted that the capacitance of the nitrogen-doped SWCNTs increases with charge–discharge cycles. This unusual increase is discussed based on the results of XPS, Raman, and cyclic voltammogram measurement results."

It was found that the discharge potentials were effectively increased by N-doping while it does not affect the oxygen evolution reaction. Chemical stability of the nanocarbon air-electrode was also investigated by Raman spectroscopy.
992,New layered manganese selenide KMnAgSe: Structure and properties,2014-08-01,"Single crystal of a new layered manganese selenide KMnAgSe2 was grown by the self-flux method. It adopts a ThCr2Si2-type structure and is isostructural to KMnCuSe2, with Mn and Ag being randomly distributed at the tetrahedral sites formed by Se. The metal–metal distance within the MnAgSe2 layer is much longer than that in KMnCuSe2, resulting in a significant increase in resistivity, with an optical band gap up to 2.02 eV. The observation of spin-glass behavior in KMnAgSe2 and the strong anisotropic expansion of its lattice parameters point out that short metal–metal distance is not necessary for the induction of spin-glass behavior. Rather, magnetic anisotropy measurement on KMnAgSe2 single crystal suggests that the interlayer magnetic interaction is a more critical factor."
993,Augmented cellular uptake and antiproliferation against pancreatic cancer cells induced by targeted curcumin and SPION encapsulated PLGA nanoformulation,2014-06-01,"Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) employed theragnostic work in cancer therapy exploited its inherent magnetic properties that can be utilized for drug targeting and for drug delivery applications. To attain theragnostic properties, SPION and curcumin encapsulated HER2 targeted PLGA (HER2-CUR-SPION-PLGA) nano-formulation was developed by solvent evaporation technique (CUR-SPION-PLGA NPs). The physicochemical properties of nanoconjugate were characterized using various instruments such as TEM, SEM, AFM, XPS, and VSM etc. The uptake of NPs was studied in pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2) and normal fibroblast cells (L929) by confocal microscopy and flowcytometry analysis. The anticancer potential of the NPs in the absence and presence of an external magnet (magnetic targeting property) was studied. The effect of curcumin on mitochondrial membrane potential integrity leading to apoptosis was also determined. The conjugation of HER2 to nanoconjugate for active magnetic targeting for the co-delivery of curcumin and MNPs enhanced synergistic therapeutic index. HER2-CUR-SPION-PLGA NPs displayed promising potential anticancer activity by destroying pancreatic cancer cells."
994,Blue shift tunable negative index metamaterials based on topological insulator for near-infrared spectrum,2014-06-01,"A blue-shift tunable metamaterial (MM) exhibiting a double-negative refractive index based on topological insulator (Bismuth Selenide, Bi2Se3) has been demonstrated in the near-infrared (N-IR) spectral region. The potential of Bi2Se3 as a dielectric interlayer of the multilayer MM is explored. The optical response of elliptical nanohole arrays penetrating through Au/Bi2Se3/Au films is numerically investigated using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The blue-shift tuning range of the MM is as high as 370 nm (from 2140 nm to 1770 nm) after switching the Bi2Se3 between its trigonal and orthorhombic states."
995,"Microstructure, optical properties and thermal stability of ZrB and Zr–B–N thin films as high-temperature solar selective absorbers",2014-06-01,"ZrB2 and Zr–B–N thin films were deposited by DC magnetron sputtering technique. The microstructure and optical properties of thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and spectrophotometer. Thin films with high selectivity (α = 95.26%/εRT  = 5%) were achieved by optimizing the nitrogen content of absorbing layers and thickness of antireflective layer. Thermal stability test illustrated that Zr–B–N thin film with high nitrogen content showed weak thermal stability due to the loose morphology of thin films. Thus, thin films with low nitrogen content and suitable thickness of Si3N4 layer can exhibit superior solar selectivity (α = 91.7%/εRT  = 4.1%) after annealing at 500 °C/60 h in air. The XRD, cross-sectional TEM and EDS results of films annealed at 500 °C/100 h in air demonstrated that the solar selectivity degradation of films was due to the surface oxidation of ZrB2 layer. Moreover, the solar selectivity was still kept at high level (α = 89.05%/εRT  = 10.5%) after treating in neutral salt spray for 24 h. It can be deduced that ZrB2 thin film by sputtering is a superior candidate as high-temperature solar selective absorbers."
996,Galvanic corrosion behavior between Ti6Al4V and CoCrMo alloys in saline solution,2014-06-01,"The galvanic corrosion behaviours of two commonly used metallic materials used in artificial joints in saline solution are investigated. Electrochemical testing techniques such as open-circuit potential (OCP), galvanic current (I g ), dynamic polarisation curves and electrochemical impendence spectroscopy are used to evaluate the corrosion properties of the alloys under various immersion times. The following results are obtained: the galvanic current increases with increased immersion time; compared with static corrosion, the corrosion potential (E corr ) and corrosion current density (I corr ) of coupled Ti6Al4V alloys display inconspicuous changes, whereas the corrosion potential of CoCrMo alloys significantly decreases; corrosion current density and corrosion rate (CR) increase by at least two orders of magnitude; corrosion current density increases from 5.8397 × 10–9 Amp/cm2 to 5.1889 × 10–7 Amp/cm2; the corrosion rate increases from 6.8687 × 10–5 mm/a to 6.1033 × 10–3 mm/a; the electrochemical impendence of coupled CoCrMo alloy shows significant change because of anodic dissolution where the passive film does not easily form and stabilize. Although the galvanic current of the coupled alloys is found at a lower order of magnitude (3.8 × 10–8 A to 7 × 10–8 A) during the test period, the galvanic corrosion between Ti6Al4V and CoCrMo alloys significantly affects the electrochemical impendence of CoCrMo alloys."
997,Cu-doped Li ZnTi O anode material with improved electrochemical performance for lithium-ion batteries,2014-06-01,"In this paper, Cu-doped Li2Zn1–  x Cu x Ti3O8 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) were successfully prepared using titanate nanowires as a precursor. The effects of Cu-doping on the physicochemical properties of Li2ZnTi3O8 were extensively investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), galvanostatic charge–discharge testing, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results show that the Li2Zn1–  x Cu x Ti3O8(x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) compounds are pure well-crystallized spinel phase. In addition, the Cu-doping does not change the morphology and the electrochemical reaction process of Li2ZnTi3O8. Galvanostatic charge–discharge testing denotes that the Li2Zn0.9Cu0.1Ti3O8 exhibits highest discharge capacity among all the samples and show higher cyclic stability and better rate capability compared with pristine Li2ZnTi3O8. When charge–discharge current density increases up to 1000 mA g–1, the Li2Zn0.9Cu0.1Ti3O8 sample still maintains a capacity of 165.4 mA h g–1, while the pristine Li2ZnTi3O8 sample shows severe capacity decline at same current density. CV result reveals that the Li2Zn0.9Cu0.1Ti3O8 has the lowest polarization. It is shown by EIS that the Li2Zn0.9Cu0.1Ti3O8 exhibits higher diffusion coefficient of Li+. The superior cycling performance and good rate capability, as well as simple synthesis route of the Cu-doped Li2ZnTi3O8 are expected to show a potential commercial application."
998,Toward cluster-assembled metallic glasses,2014-06-01,"Amorphous CuZr metallic films were fabricated by deposition of gas phase metal clusters on commercially available amorphous borosilicate glass substrates under ultra-high vacuum and soft-landing conditions. The cluster beam technology was employed for the first time to validate the feasibility of its use as a production approach for glassy materials. The mixed metal clusters were generated by a state-of-the-art high frequency pulsed laser vaporization cluster beam source from an alloy target. The structure of the films was studied by surface X-ray diffraction at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The recorded X-ray diffraction patterns reveal that the cluster-assembled films lack crystalline structure. A halo peak corresponding to a scattering vector of 27.4 nm–1 is observed in the created cluster-assembled material, which confirms the glassy structure of the film. After annealing the sample at 450 K for 10 minutes two crystalline struc- tures emerge, namely the pure copper and the intermetallic CuZr phases. These two crystalline phases are also observed for as prepared (without annealing) cluster-assembled films with a thickness of about 600 nm."
999,Single step preparation of nano size gamma alumina exhibiting enhanced fluoride adsorption,2014-06-01,"A direct single step solution combustion synthesis is adopted to prepare nano γ-Al2O3 using aluminium nitrate as oxidizer and urea or hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) as fuel in the presence of a variety of surfactants. The obtained products were characterized by powder XRD and IR. The phase and size of the product was found to be depending on the nature of surfactant or fuel used. FESEM and TEM analysis of urea-surfactant based gamma alumina shows a fairly uniform spherical morphology of particle aggregates with lower nano size distribution of 40–60 nm. In HMT based γ-Al2O3 the particle size was greater than 200 nm. DLS analysis of the sample also showed the narrow size distribution in the urea-surfactant based γ-Al2O3 compared to HMT based γ-Al2O3 which shows broad size distribution. The nano gamma alumina powders also show specific area of 160–240 m2 g–1. The urea-CTAB synthesized γ-Al2O3 was tested for its fluoride adsorption, exhibited adsorption capacity of 6.49 mg · g–1."
1000,Cationic ring-opening polymerization of lactones onto chemically modified single layer graphene oxide,2014-06-01,"The introduction of the acyl perchlorate groups on the surface of single layer graphene oxide was achieved via the reaction of silver perchlorate to alkyl chloride groups, which were attached to oxygen-containing functionality of single layer graphene oxide. Ring opening polymerization of β-propiolactone, γ-butyrolactone, δ-valerolactone, ε-caprolactone was conducted in a graft-from mechanism to the single layer graphene oxideCH+ 2ClO– 4 groups. Without such groups, single layer graphene oxide by itself was found not to support ring-opening polymerization; graphene oxide was not found to exhibit a carbocatalyst effect. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the grafting efficiency was around 10 wt% for each lactone and improved the oxidative resistance over that of pure single layer graphene oxide. Transmission Electron Microscope images revealed that single layer graphene oxide contained numerous dark contrast nanoparticles across the surface, corre- sponding to the formation of silver oxide from the use of silver perchlorate."
1001,High-toughness and durability performance characterization of concrete reinforced with poly(vinyl alcohol) fibers,2014-06-01,"Flexural strength, impact resistance, permeability and abrasion resistance performance of PVA fiber-reinforced concrete were measured as a function of fiber concentration. The proportions of PVA fibers in concrete matrix were 0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.3 and 1.5% volume fraction of concrete. The results showed that, with the introduction of PVA fibers, the flexural toughness and impact resistance of each prepared PVA fiber reinforced composites were improved. Compared to the reference sample, modulus of rupture, toughness indices, fracture energy, number of blows and impact energy of PVA fiber reinforced composites all were improved. The absorbed fracture energy and impact energy were provided by the mechanisms of matrix cracking, PVA fiber/matrix interface debonding, fiber pull-out and fiber rupture. The SEM analysis showed that the introduced PVA fiber acted as bridge across the crack, which improved the load-transfer efficiency. In addition, the permeability and abrasion resistance properties were also improved. However, a deterioration was occurred in composites with 1.5 vol.% PVA fibers. This reduction might be caused by the correspondingly introduced poor pore parameters and the loss of mix workability."
1002,Molecular simulation studies on microstructure of phospholipid nano-carrier for hydrophobic drug delivery,2014-06-01,"Hydrophobic drugs cannot be widely used in clinic because they are difficult to be absorbed by human body. To solve this problem, the existing methods to increase solubility and to prolong effect of hydrophobic drugs were analyzed first. Then a phospholipid material was introduced as the drug carrier. To verify it, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation was performed to study the phospholipid drug carrier with drug model. Aggregate morphologies of this nano drug carrier system and the internal distributions were observed, which verified the feasibility of this nano-material as novel nano drug carrier. In this way, properties of new drug carriers can be predicted prior to experiments, research and development investment of new drugs would be much reduced."
1003,"Synthesis, characterization and photoluminescent properties of 3D nanostructures self-assembled with MnO nanoparticles",2014-06-01,"We report the hydrothermal-growth of 3D coins-like nanostructures self-assembled with single-crystalline tetragonal Mn3O4 nanoparticles using MnCl2 · 4H2O and KOH as raw materials.

FESEM results show that the average diameter of coin-like nanostructures is 95 nm and the thickness is measured to be about 35 nm. TEM investigations reveal that the as-prepared Mn3O4 nanostructures are self-assembled with randomly distributed nanoparticles having a diameter of about 3 nm on the average.

1004,Spherical meso-macroporous silica particles by emulsion-assisted dual-templating,2014-04-01,"We report the bulk synthesis of spherical meso-macroporous silica particles by a dual templating inside emulsion droplets. Amidine polystyrene (PS) beads and amphiphilic triblock copolymers are simultaneously assembled inside an emulsion with tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) as silica source, which form composite structured particles during the evaporation of droplets. By burning out PS beads and the triblock copolymers, spherical meso-macroporous silica particles were produced in powder form. The size of macropores could be controlled with a size of PS beads. Resulting hierarchically porous particles have more than three times the specific surface area of simple macroporous particles. Consequently, these meso-macroporous particles have high potential use in various applications requiring large surface-to-volume ratio, including catalytic supports, adsorbents, or drug carriers."
1005,Critical current density improvement by intermediate deformation for the fabrication of BiSrCaCuO/Ag round wires,2014-04-01,"Multi-filamentary Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+δ/Ag round wires were fabricated by the powder-in-tube method. Both draw- ing and cold isostatic pressing methods were used to densify the filament cores of the Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+δ/Ag round wires during intermediate deformation after the first heat treatment. Critical current measurements show that both methods can increase the self-field critical current density at 77 K. By optimizing the drawing process, the core density of the first heat treated round wires was increased significantly, resulting in a more than doubled critical current density improvement of the Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+δ/Ag round wires. Increasing the drawing stress using a high strength metal sheath increased the critical current density further to about 1 × 104 A/cm2. By carrying out the intermediate deformation using the cold isostatic pressing method, the optimal critical current density was 8.6 × 103 A/cm2."
1006,Preferential distribution of polyaniline in different phases of acrylate triblock copolymer,2014-04-01,"Polyaniline (PAni) nanorod was synthesized through electrochemical polymerization method from aniline sulphate in aqueous medium. Nano-composite of PAni with acrylate block copolymer (BCP) was prepared by dispersing PAni at 2% and 4% loading into ABA type poly(methyl methacrylate-b-butyl acrylate-b-methyl methacrylate) (PMMA-b-PBA-b-PMMA) triblock copolymer via solution casting method. Morphological studies prove that at lower loading PAni first goes to PMMA phase leading to increase in surface roughness, followed by PBA phase at increased loading leading to decrease in surface roughness due to increase in homogeneity of distribution of polyaniline in the matrix. AC resistivity decreases with polyaniline loading. Preferential addition to PMMA phase at 2% loading shows the lowest resistivity whereas dielectric constant is the highest in 4% loading. Addition of PAni, even at low loading increases thermal stability of the copolymer matrix. Thermal degradation characteristics of the composites show well correlation with the distribution characteristics of PAni in copolymer matrix."
1007,"Electrical, optical, and visible light-photocatalytic properties of zirconium-doped BiVO nanoparticles",2014-04-01,"Zirconium (3.0, 9.1 and 15.9 at.%)-doped BiVO4 and pristine BiVO4 nanoparticles were synthesized hydrothermally. The high resolution and field emission scanning electron microscopic images and the transmission electron micrographs show the synthesized materials as nanoparticles. The energy dispersive X-ray spectral analysis provides the percentage of Zr-doping. The Zr-doping favors transformation of the monoclinic phase of BiVO4 to the tetragonal lattice. Segregation of tetragonal ZrO2 occurs at 15.9% Zr-doping leading to formation of heterojunction. While 9.1% Zr-doped BiVO4 nanoparticles provide a perfect semicircular Nyquist plot with least charge transfer resistance pristine and 3.0% Zr-doped BiVO4 nanoparticles exhibit a half-semicircular arcs. The corresponding profile of 15.9% Zr-doped BiVO4 is a truncated semicircle with largest charge transfer resistance. Doping BiVO4 with zirconium does not shift the absorption edge significantly. The doped and pristine BiVO4 nanoparticles display near band gap and deep level emissions. Doping BiVO4 with zirconium enhances the visible light photocatalytic activity, evaluated by the degradation of methylene blue dye. The observed photocatalytic activities of the synthesized nanoparticles are explained in terms of charge transfer resistance and photoluminescence."
1008,Synthesis of sapphire nanoparticles with graphite shells by hot-filament chemical vapor deposition,2014-04-01,"Graphite-encapsulated sapphire nanoparticles were successfully obtained after hot-filament chemical vapor deposition (HF-CVD) performed to pure Al powder at 600 °C for 60 min. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and selected area electron diffraction patterns showed that alumina nanoparticles were formed as inner cores with sizes ranging from approximately 20 to 50 nm and those phases were sapphire. To elucidate the formation process of the graphite encapsulated sapphire nanoparticles, the effect of HF-CVD temperature was examined. At first, all the pure Al powder was transformed to γ alumina at 400 °C. The phase transformation from γ to δ and/or  alumina and decreasing sizes of alumina nanoparticles from 1–2 μm to 50–200 nm were proceeding at 550 °C. Furthermore, the phase transformation to sapphire and decreasing sizes to less than 50 nm occurred at 600 °C. HR-TEM images also showed that graphite shells were formed on the surface of orthorhombic δ 2, monoclinic  1,  2, and sapphire but not on the surfaces of cubic γ and δ 1. These experimental results suggested the presence of a new graphite-encapsulation mechanism to graphiteencapsulated sapphire nanoparticles in HF-CVD."
1009,"Determination of size distribution of silica nanoparticles: A comparison of scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and flow field-flow fractionation with multiangle light scattering methods",2014-04-01,"Methods for the accurate determination of the size and size distribution of nanomaterials are essential for nanoand biotechnology. Among the methods available, flow field-flow fractionation with multiangle light scattering and UV absorption detectors (FFFF-MALS-UV) is considered to be a more effective method than field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) for determining the size and size distribution of nanomaterials. However, the raw values of size and size distribution obtained using these three methods are number-, volume-, and z-averaged, respectively. In order to compare the size and size distribution determined using different measurement methods, it is necessary to transform the raw values into the same dimensionality of length. In this study, we transformed the raw values obtained using the above mentioned three methods into the same dimensionality and found that the results for averaged size and size distribution were qualitatively similar despite the differences between the measurement methods. However, even though the obtained values were transformed to have the same dimensionality, the values obtained using FFFF-MALS-UV were found to be weighted more heavily by larger particles than those obtained using FE-SEM. Furthermore, the results obtained using DLS were weighted more heavily by larger particles than those obtained using FFFF-MALS-UV. This result was due to the observed physicochemical phenomena utilized by these two measurement methods, namely, UV absorption in the case of FFFF-MALS-UV and light scattering intensity in the case of DLS."
1010,Eu –Dy  co-doped NaGd(PO) phosphors for white light luminescence,2014-04-01,"Eu3+–Dy3+ co-doped Na3Gd(PO4)2 phosphors were prepared by the solid state reaction method at high temperature. The structural and surface morphological properties have been studied using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy techniques. The energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum were recorded to understand the elemental and vibrational analysis respectively. The energy transfer efficiency from Dy3+ to Eu3+ ions has been calculated. From the emission spectra, the CIE chromaticity color coordinates (x,y) were evaluated in order to predict the colors emitted by the phosphors. It is concluded that the emission color of the titled phosphor depends on the doping concentrations of Eu3+–Dy3+ ions."

1012,Large-scale exfoliation of hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets in liquid phase,2014-04-01,"Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), the structure analogue of graphite, has many potential applications owing to its superb thermal, electrical and mechanical properties. In this study, a novel facile mixture solvents strategy (ammonia water solution/isopropyl alcohol) was developed for the preparation of h-BN nanosheets (BNNSs) in large scale, and the results demonstrated the exfoliated BNNSs were very stable in isopropyl alcohol solution. Lewis acid-base interaction was considered to be the mechanism for the exfoliation of h-BN due to the electron-deficient boron atoms. This simple and low cost exfoliation approach could provide a promising platform for preparation and applications of BNNSs in the future."
1013,Ultraviolet long afterglow emission in Bi  doped CdSiO phosphors,2014-04-01,"Visible and near infrared long afterglow phosphors are being widely used and reported. In contrast, long afterglow phosphors for ultraviolet wavelengths are seldom reported. Here a novel Bi3+ doped CdSiO3 phosphor with ultraviolet long afterglow emission was prepared by the high temperature solid state method and its afterglow luminescent property was investigated. After 221 nm light irradiation, Bi3+ doped CdSiO3 phosphors exhibited ultraviolet long afterglow emission at 360 nm. The possible mechanism of this ultraviolet long afterglow phosphor was also considered."
1014,Synthesis and properties of carbon nanofibers filled cement-based composites combined with new surfactant methylcellulose,2014-04-01,"Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) are considered as a promising candidate for the next generation high performance and multi-functional composites materials of the 21st century for their remarkable properties. In this paper, the mechanical properties of the cement/CNFs composites were analyzed with low concentrations of CNFs at 0.05%, 0.075%, 0.1% and 0.2% by weight of cement at 7, 14 and 28 days. A new surfactant, methylcellulose (MC), was first applied in this CNFs/cement composites research. The results showed that the added CNFs were found to degrade the corresponding flexural strength of cement materials at 7 days, whereas enhanced it at 14 and 28 days. Compared to reference sample, the maximum improvement rate of flexural strength at 28 days is about 21%. However, the compressive strength stayed in a constant stage, and a little deterioration could be found among the CNFs/cement composites. Meanwhile, a crack bridging and fiber-pullout effect was discerned by an ultra-high resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), which ensures load-transfer across voids and cracks. The distribution state of CNFs in matrix was measured by an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and the given results indicated the embedded CNFs were dispersed well in matrix."
1015,Implantable zirconia bioceramics for bone repair and replacement: A chronological review,2014-02-01,"Bone tissue engineering applies scientific principles to repair, regenerate, and restore the functions of defected hard tissues or to replace them with purposely built biomaterials. In the past few decades, the design, construction and modification of biomaterials possessing desirable properties—those mimicking natural bone—remained the center of attention. Consequently, zirconia is found to be the material of choice for bone repair and replacement applications due to its unique biomechanical properties. This paper aims to present a succinct review of the applications of zirconia based biomaterials in bone tissue engineering; for instance, as implantable bioceramic, as coating or thin film on other metallic implants, as porous bone scaffold and substitute material, and as a radio-opacifying agent in bone cements. The evolution of zirconia as an essential material in biomedical applications, especially those concerning bone repair and replacement, is presented in a chronological order. Particular emphasis is placed on recent progress and drawbacks of zirconia and its composites in terms of their mechanical and biological properties. It is concluded that zirconia certainly enjoys the best combination of mechanical strength, fracture toughness, biocompatibility, and bioactivity; however, its properties can be further improved either by suitable surface modification or through combination with other bioactive ceramics and glasses."
1016,Synthesis and luminescence properties of LaOCl:Nd  nanostructures via combination of electrospinning with chlorination technique,2014-02-01,"LaOCl:Nd3+ nanofibers, nanobelts and hollow nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning combined with a double-crucible chlorination technique using NH4 Cl powders as chlorinating agent. Different morphologies of LaOCl:Nd3+ nanomaterials were only obtained via adjusting some of the electrospun parameters. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis indicated that LaOCl:Nd3+ nanostructures were tetragonal with space group P4/nmm. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis and histograms revealed that diameters LaOCl:Nd3+ nanofibers and hollow nanofibers, and the width of LaOCl:Nd3+ nanobelts were respectively 217.64 ± 30.34 nm, 143.35 ± 15.77 nm and 3.69 ± 0.49 m under the 95% confidence level. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) observation showed that as-obtained LaOCl:Nd3+ hollow nanofibers were hollow-centered structure. Under the excitation of a 532-nm laser, LaOCl:Nd3+ nanostructures exhibit the characteristic emissions of predominant peaks at 913, 1069 and 1345 nm, attributed to 4F3/2 → 4I9/2, 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 and 4F3/2 → 4I13/2 energy levels transitions of Nd3+ ions, respectively. The optimum doping molar concentration of the Nd3+ ions in the LaOCl:Nd3+ nanofibers is 5.0%. LaOCl:Nd3+ nanofibers exhibited the strongest PL intensity of the three morphologies under the same doping concentration and same measuring conditions. The formation mechanisms of LaOCl:Nd3+ nanofibers, nanobelts and hollow nanofibers were also proposed."
1017,"Iron pyrite, a potential photovoltaic material, increases plant biomass upon seed pretreatment",2014-02-01,"Iron pyrite (FeS2) is a promising material with plethora of applications ranging from sulfuric acid production to photo-voltaic devices. Interestingly, the proponents of the theory of hydrothermal origin of life on earth argues that FeS2 may have evolved 4.0 billion years ago, and used as an energy source by the earliest evolving life forms on earth. In the present time, bacteria like Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, which survives in the oxygen deficient environments, derives energy solely from FeS2 to maintain its critical biomass. The key question, we addressed in this paper is 'whether higher plants have the ability to derive energy solely from FeS2, just like the way Thiobacillus species does.' To answer this question, we developed a novel, inexpensive, low temperature scheme (< 100 °C) for FeS2 synthesis. We characterize FeS2 using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) techniques. Further, we pretreated the chick-pea (Legume) seeds for 12 hours in sterile, double distilled aqueous medium of dispersed FeS2 (80 μg/ml). Following this, we allowed these seeds to grow in sterile, double distilled water for 7 days. At this stage, we observed that FeS2 pre-treated seeds result in significantly healthier plants, with increased dryweight and enhanced sulfur content as compared to the control plants. In summary, a brief FeS2 pre-treatment of the seeds resulted in increased plant biomass. This study has drawn an evolutionary consilience between two diverse life forms in terms of their ability to use a common pre-biotic energy molecule for biomass production. Our results suggest that FeS2 apart from its opto-electronic potential, could also be used as a pro-fertilizer for sustainable agriculture practices."
1018,"Influence of thermal annealing on structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of NiO–Cu composite thin films",2014-02-01,"p-type NiO–Cu composite thin films were deposited using DC reactive magnetron sputtering technique. The deposited films were annealed in air at different temperatures and characterized for studying the structural, morphological, compositional, optical and electrical properties. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the crystallite size increased with increasing the annealing temperature and the films exhibited a stable cubic structure even at higher annealing temperatures. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies indicated that all the annealed films have single phase NiO–Cu. Morphological studies showed that the grain size and roughness increased with increasing the annealing temperature. The annealed films exhibited high optical transmittance with lowest resistivity when compared to as deposited films."
1019,Defect reduction in heteroepitaxial InP on Si by epitaxial lateral overgrowth,2014-02-01,"Epitaxial lateral overgrowth of InP has been grown by hydride vapor phase epitaxy on Si substrates with a thin seed layer of InP masked with SiO2. Openings in the form of multiple parallel lines as well as mesh patterns from which growth occurred were etched in the SiO2 mask and the effect of different growth conditions in terms of V/III ratio and growth temperature on defects such as threading dislocations and stacking faults in the grown layers was investigated. The samples were characterized by cathodoluminescence and by transmission electron microscopy. The results show that the cause for threading dislocations present in the overgrown layers is the formation of new dislocations, attributed to coalescence of merging growth fronts, possibly accompanied by the propagation of pre-existing dislocations through the mask openings. Stacking faults were also pre-existing in the seed layer and propagated to some extent, but the most important reason for stacking faults in the overgrown layers was concluded to be formation of new faults early during growth. The formation mechanism could not be unambiguously determined, but of several mechanisms considered, incorrect deposition due to distorted bonds along overgrowth island edges was found to be in best agreement with observations."
1020,Augmenting thermal and mechanical properties of epoxy thermosets: The role of thermally-treated versus surface-modified TiO nanoparticles,2014-02-01,"Inorganic particulate reinforcements for organic epoxy resins and polymers attracted intense exploratory research in recent years to better the performance of existing composite materials and to devise new compositions of high performing materials. This work is aimed at investigating the role of crystalline and functional TiO2 nanoparticles in enhancing thermal and mechanical properties of epoxy thermosets. For this purpose, TiO2 nanoparticles are prepared and subjected to different processes, i.e., either thermal or surface chemical treatment, to obtain crystalline or functional TiO2 reinforcements differing in particle size, morphology, crystallinity, and surface chemistry. These TiO2 nanoparticles are subsequently embedded into epoxy matrix to form crystalline TiO2/epoxy (CTEN) or functional TiO2/epoxy (FTEN) nanocomposites with 2.5–12.5 wt.% TiO2. Thus obtained nanocomposite are characterized by FTIR, SEM, DSC, TG, and static mechanical analyses. It is found that FTEN composites possess greater tensile strength (> 49%), fracture strength (> 64%), modulus (> 80%), toughness (> 35%), and Tg  (> 48%) as compared to the reference epoxy polymer. CTEN composites, on the other hand, possess greater thermal stability. It is revealed that thermal decomposition temperature as well as final residual weight of CTEN composites are substantially increased by the presence of crystalline TiO2 nanoparticles. The optimum ratio of crystalline TiO2 nanoparticles for CTEN composites is found to be ≤5 wt.%, whereas the ratio of functional TiO2 nanoparticles for FTEN composites is ≤ 10.0 wt%, thus offering better performance of FTEN composites through appropriate processing of the inorganic reinforcements."

The composition, structure, and electrochemical properties were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chrono-potentiometry. The first discharge capacity of as-deposited and annealed SnGNS obtained was 1551 mA h/g and 975 mA h/g, respectively. The anodes show excellent cyclic performance and coulombic efficiency."
1022,Oxalate co-precipitation synthesis of LiNiCrMnO/Ag composite for lithium-ion batteries,2014-02-01,"The rate capability and cyclic performance of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 under high current density have been significantly improved by doping a small amount of chromium (Cr). Specifically, LiNi0.45Cr0.05Mn1.5O4 and LiNi0.45Cr0.05Mn1.5O4/Ag synthesized by co-precipitation reaction can respectively deliver a discharge capacity of 122 and 128 mA h g–1 at 5 °C rate. At 0.5 C discharge rate, LiNi0.45Cr0.05Mn1.5O4 and LiNi0.45Cr0.05Mn1.5O4/Ag can maintain 94.6% and 98.5% of their initial capacity after 200 cycles respectively. The result demonstrates that Cr-doping and Ag-coating could be a way to enhance the electrochemical performance of spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4."
1023,Mg -ion conducting poly(ethylene glycol)-TiO composite polymer electrolytes for solid-state batteries,2014-02-01,"Composite polymer electrolytes based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), magnesium acetate [Mg(CH3COO)2], and x wt.% of titanium dioxide (TiO2) ceramic fillers (where x = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20, respectively) have been prepared using solution casting technique. The X-ray diffraction patterns of PEG-Mg(CH3COO)2 with TiO2 ceramic filler indicated the decrease in the degree of crystallinity with increasing concentration of the filler. The DSC measurements of PEG-Mg(CH3COO)2-TiO2 composite polymer electrolyte system showed that the melting temperature is shifted towards the lower temperature with increase of the filler concentration. Complex impedance analysis shows the existence of bulk and material-electrode interface properties of the composites. The conductivity results indicate that the maximum ionic conductivity 5 × 10–5 S/cm was obtained for PEG-Mg(CH3COO)2-TiO2 (85-15-10) system at room temperature (303 K). The conductance spectra show two distinct regions: a dc plateau and a dispersive region. The relative dielectric constant (ε r) decreases with increase in frequency in the low frequency region whereas frequency independent behavior is observed in the high frequency region."
1024,Performance enhancement in chemical vapor deposition graphene field-effect transistors by high- dielectric screening,2014-02-01,"The transport properties of CVD graphene-based field-effect transistors (GFETs) before and after introducing high-κ dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were investigated. The results show that after introducing DMSO, the performance of GFETs was significantly improved: the maximum drain current ID  max, the maximum transconductance gm  max, and the field-effect mobility increase by 2.5, 24, and 23 times, respectively. The mechanism for the performance enhancement by high-κ dielectric was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy and transport measurements, and both are consistent with each other."
1025,Adsorption of methylene blue in water by reduced graphene oxide: Effect of functional groups,2013-12-01,"Here we prepared three reduced graphene oxides-hydrazine and H2/Ar reduced graphene oxide at 200 and 500 °C (RGO-N, RGO-H-200 and RGO-H-500) with almost identical Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas to study the effect of functional groups on adsorption behaviors for the removal of methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solution. The maximum adsorption capacities of RGO-N, RGO-H-200 and RGO-H-500 for MB were 159, 91 and 81 mg/g at 283 K, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectra measurements demonstrated that the content of relevant functional groups in three adsorbents differs from each other. The C=O or C=N double bonds are able to couple with the C–C/C=C bonds to form a large conjugate structure, enhancing the interactions between RGO and MB molecules. While, the C=OH bonds contribute little, if any, to the increase of adsorption efficiency because of the steric hindrance towards benzene-ring containing dye molecules."
1026,Photocatalytic and antimicrobial activities of functionalized silicate sol–gel embedded ZnO–TiO nanocomposite materials,2013-12-01,"In this study, zinc oxide–titanium dioxide nanocomposite materials (ZnO–TiO2)NCM have been synthesized through a simple chemical route which are dispersed into various amine functionalized silicate sol–gel matrices (FSG) and are characterized by DRS, PL, XRD, TEM, SEM and EDAX techniques. The photocatalytic performance of the obtained Silicate/(ZnO–TiO2)NCM towards the decomposition of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and their antimicrobial activity for the inhibition of Escherichia coli (gram negative bacteria), Bacillus cereus (gram positive bacteria) and Trichoderma longibrachiatum (fungi) have been evaluated and the results are compared with controlled samples. In particular, the dispersion of (ZnO–TiO2)NCM into the silicate matrices has induced more beneficial effect on the photodegradation and antimicrobial activities. The Silicate/(ZnO–TiO2)NCM has exhibited maximum photodegradation and antimicrobial inhibition zone when compared to controlled samples."
1027,Structure and optical properties of carbon–TiO composite thin films by sol–gel method as solar selective absorbers,2013-12-01,"C–TiO2 thin films as low cost solar selective absorbers were prepared by sol–gel method and post-annealing. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer are employed to characterize the structure and optical properties. The results illustrated that C–TiO2 composite thin films can be obtained after spinning and post-annealing. The solar absorptance (α) and thermal emissivity (ε) vary with carbon content and annealing conditions. The optimal annealing condition is 500 °C/2 h and the optimal carbon content is about 0.6 with α = 0.87 and ε = 0.13. C–TiO2 composite thin films own good thermal stability at 100 °C, which proves that it can be a good candidate as low-temperature solar selective absorbers."
1028,Shape memory supramolecular networks for the photoregulated adsorption and release of model molecules,2013-12-01,"Multifunctional semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN) constituted of poly(methacrylic acid-co-4phenylazomaleinanil) (MAA-AzoMI) and Pluronic was designed and prepared, which is stabilized by hydrogenbonding interactions between PMAA carboxylic protons and Pluronic ether group. The characteristics of the materials were investigated by FTIR spectra, DSC, DMA and swelling measurements. Because of a large difference in storage modulus below and above the glass transition temperature, the semi-IPN material shows excellent shape memory effect with a recovery ratio of nearly 98%. For this system, the fixing phase is the MAA-AzoMI network, while the reversible phase is the PMAA-Pluronic complex phase. Meanwhile, by introducing azobenzene side group, this supramolecular network is sensitive to UV and visible light. The photoinduced trans → cis isomerization of azobenzene chromophores in the semi-IPN material leads to a transition from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity of the polymer network. Therefore, UV light can induce a rapid autoloading of drug molecules into the network, and then the bound model molecules can be released under visible light."
1029,Growth mechanism of ZnO nanostructures for ultra-high piezoelectric   coefficient,2013-12-01,"A comparative morphological study of different ZnO nanostructures was carried out with different varying process parameters for energy harvesting. Molarity, temperature, growth duration and seed layer were such fundamental controlling parameters. The study brings out an outstanding piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of 44.33 pm/V for vertically aligned ZnO nanorod structures, considered as the highest reported d 33 value for any kind of ZnO nanostructures. XRD analysis confirms wurtzite nature of this nanorod structure with [0001] as preferential growth direction. Semiconducting characteristic of nanorods was determined with temperature induced I/V characterization."
1030,A comparative study of room temperature ferromagnetism in MgO films deposited by rf/dc sputtering using high purity Mg and MgO targets,2013-12-01,"Thin films of nanocrystalline MgO were deposited on glass/Si substrates by rf/dc sputtering from metallic Mg, and ceramic MgO targets. The purpose of this study is to identify the differences in the properties, magnetic in particular, of MgO films obtained on sputter deposition from 99.99% pure metallic Mg target in a controlled [Nitrogen + Oxygen partial pressure (O2pp)] atmosphere as against those deposited using an equally pure ceramic MgO target in argon + identical oxygen ambience conditions while maintaining the same total pressure in the chamber in both cases. Characterization of the films was carried out by X-ray diffraction, focussed ion beam cross sectioning, atomic force microscopy and SQUID-magnetometry. The 'as-obtained' films from pure Mg target are found to be predominantly X-ray amorphous, while the ceramic MgO target gives crystalline films, (002) oriented with respect to the film plane. The films consisted of nano-crystalline grains of size in the range of about 0.4 to 4.15 nm with the films from metallic target being more homogeneous and consisting of mostly subnanometer grains. Both the types of films are found to be ferromagnetic to much above room temperature. We observe unusually high maximum saturation magnetization (M S) values of 13.75 emu/g and ∼ 4.2 emu/g, respectively for the MgO films prepared from Mg, and MgO targets. The origin of magnetism in MgO films is attributed to Mg vacancy (V Mg), and 2p holes localized on oxygen sites. The role of nitrogen in enhancing the magnetic moments is also discussed."
1031,Nanoscale additions of aluminium oxide and copper to strengthen AZ91/ZK60A hybrid magnesium alloy,2013-12-01,"Nanoscale additions of oxide (Al2O3) and reactive transition metal (Cu) were used to strengthen hybrid magnesium alloy AZ91/ZK60A after hot extrusion. In tension, the strength of AZ91/ZK60A was increased by up to +12% while the ductility was maintained near 10%. Co-existence of fine nanoparticles around coarse nanoparticles in the alloy matrix after nanoscale additions of Al2O3 and Cu was observed. The observation of mainly non-basal slip in the high strain zone (HSZ) adjacent to: (1) sharp points of the coarse nanoparticle or (2) near-spherical fine nanoparticles (after room temperature tensile deformation) contributed to strengthening of the alloy matrix. In comparison, mainly basal slip was observed in the HSZ around curved surfaces of the coarse nanoparticle, this being responsible for localized ductility enhancement. The observed synergistic ability of coarse nanoparticles surrounded by fine nanoparticles (having effectively > 100 nm or submicron size) to break up approaching HSZs also contributed to localised ductility enhancement. In compression, nanoscale additions of Al2O3 and Cu increased strength (by up to +51%) while the ductility was maintained near 12%. Here, these collective additions to AZ91/ZK60A enabled the strain hardening rate to be higher, resulting in ductility loss."
1032,Fabrication of titania nanowires incorporated paper sheets and study of their optical properties,2013-12-01,"Paper sheets were fabricated by incorporating TiO2 nanowires (NWs) (diameters ca. 20 to 40 nm and length between 1 to 7 m) as filler by the standard Handsheet making procedure. The TiO2 NWs were synthesized by hydrothermal method using commercial TiO2 as precursor. It was observed that the TiO2 NWs incorporation in the paper sheet improves the optical properties such as brightness from 55.2 to 61.9% ISO and opacity from 93.1 to 97.5% ISO. The TiO2 NWs as well as the NWs incorporated paper sheets were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis."
1033,Energy transfer and photoluminescence properties in Bi and Eu co-doped ZnGaO,2013-12-01,"A series of single phase Bi3+/Eu3+ co-doped ZnGa2O4 phosphors were prepared by high temperature solid state reaction and their luminescence properties were investigated. The Bi3+/Eu3+ co-doped ZnGa2O4 phosphor exhibited an intense broad blue light emission located at 430 nm from Bi3+ and a narrow red emission at 616 nm form Eu3+. Energy transfer from Bi3+ to Eu3+ was observed in the ZnGa2O4 host matrix. The color tunbility of Bi3+/Eu3+ co-doped ZnGa2O4 phosphor can be obtained by changing the Eu3+ concentration, which indicates that color tunable Bi3+/Eu3+ co-doped ZnGa2O4 phosphor has a potential application in light emitting diodes. Additionally, the blue long persistent luminescence of ZnGa2O4:Bi3+ phosphor was obtained."
1034,Graphite-encapsulated alumina nanoparticles fabricated by hot-filament chemical vapor deposition,2013-12-01,"Graphite encapsulation occurs for metal or carbide nanopartices and is explained by segregation of graphite shells from molten nanoparticles. We report a different type of graphite encapsulation: graphite-encapsulated alumina nanoparticles obtained by hot-filament chemical vapor deposition. Transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed that alumina nanoparticles were formed as inner cores with sizes ranging from approximately 50 to 200 nm. X-ray diffraction and selected area diffraction patterns indicated the structures of the alumina nanoparticles consisted of monoclinic  1,  2 and orthorhombic δ 2 phases, which are higher temperature phases of bulk alumina. The results suggest a different graphite-encapsulation mechanism from segregation of graphite shells out of molten nanoparticles."

1037,Fluorescence imaging of human erythrocytes by carbon nanoparticles isolated from food stuff and their fluorescence enhancement by blood plasma,2013-09-01,"We have isolated carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) from bread. A simple oxidative treatment make them water soluble and fluorescent. CNPs exhibit fluorescence over a broad range of excitation wavelengths. These fluorescent CNPs have been susscessfully used for fluorescence imaging of human erythrocytes under 488 and 561 nm bandpass filters. Upon direct interaction with human erythrocytes, these CNPs show ∼6% haemolysis in 5 h. In the presence of blood plasma, the quantum yield of these water soluble carbon nanoparticles enhances from 2 to 4.5% leading to rise a new phenomenon of auto passivation of CNPs by bio-fluids. Therefore, these fluorescent CNPs can be used as a unique and new type of biomaterial for bioimaging and other biomedical applications."
1038,Electrospun Nd-doped spinel nanoparticles/nanofibers with both excitation and emission wavelengths in the optical window of cells and tissues,2013-09-01,"ZnAl2O4 nanofibers and nanoparticles were in situ synthesized by electrospinning technique. Utilizing poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) with different degree of polymerization, SEM (scanning electron microscope) results indicate that ZnAl2O4 nanostructures exhibit different morphologies under the same electrospun parameters. When PVP with high molecular weight (Mw = 1,300,000) was used, the ultra-long ZnAl2O4 nanofibers were obtained with an average diameter of ∼200 nm. However, while PVP with low molecular weight (K-30) was used, the ZnAl2O4 changed into particle-shape with an average size of ∼100 nm. Utilizing Nd3+ ions as the optical activator, three emission peaks centered at 905 nm, 1064 nm and 1335 nm were detected respectively in the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of ZnAl2O4:Nd3+ nanostructures under 808 nm laser excitation. It is noticed that both the excitation wavelength (808 nm) and the emission wavelength (905 nm and 1064 nm) are located in the 700–1100 nm optical window of cells and tissues. And the cytotoxicity investigation indicates ZnAl2O4:Nd3+ nanostructures are biocompatible with human cells, which endow their potential application as biological mark-ers, etc."
1039,Quantum-dot-embedded colloidal polymeric particles for white light-emitting-diode with high color rendering index,2013-09-01,"We report on the simple colloidal encapsulation of quantum dots into polymeric microspheres using oil-in-water emulsions, which was generated by ultrasound emulsification method. Poly(styrene-co-methylmethacrylate) and Cd(S, Se) or [email protected] nanoparticles were dissolved in toluene and emulsified into water with surfactant. Then, oil phase inside emulsions was slowly evaporated producing composite microspheres of polymer and quantum dots. Their size could be controlled well by either varying the concentration of polymers in emulsion phase or adjusting the size of emulsion droplets. Finally, quantum-dot-embedded polymeric microspheres were deposited on the blue LED chips which showed white colors with high value of color rendering index."
1040,Optical and luminescence properties of Eu-doped phosphate based glasses,2013-09-01,"Phosphate based glasses with chemical compositions of P2O5 + K2O + Al2O3 + CaF2 + Eu2O3 were prepared and characterized by the SEM with EDS, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential thermal analysis (DTA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Raman, absorption, emission, excitation and decay measurements at room temperature. An intense red emission at 614 nm has been observed corresponding to the 5D0→7F2 transition of Eu3+ ions. Phonon side band (PSB) spectroscopic technique has been used to investigate the local structure around Eu3+ ions and phonon energy of the host. Judd–Ofelt parameters have been evaluated from the emission intensity ratios of 5D0→7F J /5 D0→7F1 (J=2, 4) transitions as well as from the absorption data under different constraints. The evaluated JO intensity parameters have been used to predict the radiative properties for the 5D0→7F J  (J=0–4) transitions. The experimental decay times (τ exp) of the 5D0 level obtained by monitoring the emission at 614 nm are found to be independent of Eu3+ ions concentration."
1041,Intense red upconversion emission and temperature sensing in Er/Yb co-doped BaGdZnO phosphor,2013-09-01,"Zincate Ba5Gd8Zn4O21 phosphors with various Er3+ and Yb3+ concentrations were prepared via a simple solid state reaction, and their crystal structures were examined by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD). Pumped by 980 nm, the zincate phosphors exhibit intense red upconversion emission corresponding to the 4F9/2→4I15/2 transition. Tested under the same condition, it was found that the upconversion emission of zincate phosphor was intenser than that of commercial Y2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ phosphor. Hence, it is believed that Ba5Gd8Zn4O21 is a favorable host material for high efficient upconversion luminescence. Based on the change of their intensities ratio of 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 emissions with temperature, the temperature sensing behavior of the phosphor was studied, in which the maximum sensor sensitivity was deduced to be 0.0024 K–1. Moreover, with the increase of temperature, the emission colors of the phosphor can be adjusted from red to yellow-green. Therefore, this phosphor may have potential application for temperature sensor as well as for warning function to ambient temperature."
1042,Photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of Rhodamine B with sprayed -FeO photocatalyst,2013-09-01,"Spray deposited iron oxide thin films have been synthesized using ferric trichloride precursor in ethanolic medium. The effect of deposition temperature onto photochemical, structural, morphological, optical, luminescence and thermal properties has been investigated. Structural analysis confirms α-Fe2O3 (hematite) phase with rhombohedral crystal structure. The SEM images of optimized Fe2O3 thin films show needle like structure with varying grain size from 120–250 nm. The observed direct band gap is varying from 2.16 to 2.21 eV with substrate temperature. Room temperature photoluminescence spectra showed three pronounced emission peaks such as, UV near-band-edge emission peak around 380–436 nm, a blue emission around 468 nm, and green emission around 560 nm. The XPS results revealed the presence of Fe3+ in Fe2O3 photoelectrode. The photocatalytic oxidation of Rhodamine B (RhB) with hematite Fe2O3 thin films under solar illumination is investigated. The first order rate constants of photocatalysis are evaluated as a function of the initial concentration of RhB. The extent of mineralization has been studied by analyzing total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The estimated values of COD, TOC are decreases from 82 to 9.6 mg/l and 78.7 to 13.9 mg/l respectively."
1043,Controlled synthesis and photocatalytic properties of three dimensional hierarchical ZnO microflowers,2013-09-01,"In this work, we report one pot facile hydrothermal synthesis of ZnO microflowers assembled through numerous nanosheets at low temperature. The microstructure and morphology of the as-obtained product can be tailored by altering growth parameters, such as reaction temperature, time, pH value and the type of zinc source. The possible growth mechanism for ZnO microflowers was proposed based on the experimental results. Photocatalytic tests demonstrate that the methyl orange (MO) dispersed in aqueous solution can be degraded over 95% after 90 min under UV light irradiation. In addition, the dyes of Congo red (CR) and methylene blue (MB) dispersed in aqueous solution degradation experiments were also conducted under the same conditions, respectively. The ZnO microflowers exhibit excellent photocatalytic activities with a degradation efficiency of 97% for CR with 55 min of irradiation and 98% for MB with 40 min of irradiation. The as-prepared ZnO products may be a promising candidate for photocatalytic applications in waste water purification."
1044,Start-up friction properties of poly(vinyl alcohol)/nano-hydroxyapatite/silk composite hydrogel,2013-09-01,"Poly(vinyl alcohol)/nano-hydroxyapatite/silk composite hydrogel was synthesized by repeated freezing and thawing with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), nano-hydroxyapatite (HA) and silk. Friction tests between PVA-HA-Silk composite hydrogel and bovine knee articular cartilage were performed on a Micro-tribometer. Start-up friction mechanism of PVA-HA-Silk composite hydrogel was investigated under different conditions. The results demonstrated that mechanical properties of PVA-HA-Silk composite hydrogel are enhanced with the adding of HA and silk and start-up friction coefficient decreases with the increase of silk. Normal displacement and start-up friction coefficient increase with the increase of contact loads and contact time. Temperature and lubrication solution have less impact on normal displacement. The liquid flowability of PVA-HA-Silk composite hydrogel is improved with the increase of temperature, which causes the decrease of start-up friction coefficient. In a 25% bovine serum solution, proteins form a boundary film on friction surface to decrease friction effectively."
1045,Si-SnO composite as an anode material in lithium ion batteries using novel polymer binder,2013-09-01,"Si-SnO composite anode material was synthesized by ball milling approach. To prepare the anode, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVdF) and poly(acrlic acid) (PAA) were added as binders, respectively. In contrast to PVdF, PAA buffered large volume expansion of the composite electrode because of its good adhesion strength. So the battery can still maintain a high capacity after few cycles. Cycling test, AC impedance, cyclic voltametry were carried out for investigating electrochemical properties of the composite electrodes. Cycle life and other electrochemical characteristics of the battery were significantly increased by adding PAA."
1046,Evolution of texture and nature of grain growth on annealing nanocrystalline Ni and Ni-18.5%Fe in air,2013-06-01,"Grain growth behavior, change in preferred orientation and evolution of texture upon annealing nanocrystalline Ni and a Ni-18.5%Fe alloy have been studied using X-ray pole figures. Calorimetric studies show that grain growth begins at a low temperature in Ni, whereas in Ni-18.5%Fe alloy it occurs at much higher temperature. The nanocrystalline grain size, below 50 nm, of a Ni-18.5 wt%Fe alloy is retained after annealing in air at 723 K for 16 hours. This behaviour is different from the case of nanocrystalline Ni where grain growth occurs readily. As-deposited nanocrystalline Ni shows a strong (200) preferred orientation parallel to the deposition direction (// DD) which changes to a mixed (111)(200)-preferred orientation // DD upon annealing. In the case of Ni-18.5%Fe alloy, the preferred orientation changes from a mixed (111)(200) // DD in the as-deposited condition to a strong (111) // DD. The difference in the change in texture on annealing nanocrystalline Ni and Ni-18.5%Fe is explained in terms of volume fractions of misoriented grains along 〈100〉 and 〈111〉 directions and growth rates of (111) and (200) oriented grains for the two compositions."
1047,Optimal approach of three-dimensional microstructure reconstructions and visualizations,2013-06-01,"Three-dimensional (3D) digital image processing and segmentation techniques are very useful for reconstruction and visualization of materials microstructures to obtain information regarding 3D geometry of particles, either dispersed in the matrix phase or filled the 3D space. In this contribution, an approach to apply these techniques for 3D reconstruction, visualization and analysis of large datasets of grain structures is described and demonstrated through reconstruction and visualization of α-iron grains. One hundred and twenty serial sections with mean section spacing of 1.69 μm were used for reconstruction of 3D microstructure. The final reconstructed volume measures 813 × 610 × 203 μm3, containing a total of over 1859 α-iron grains. The reconstruction results clearly revealed a nearly true 3D morphology of grains, which is very important to study the grain coarsening process. Further, the 3D visualization (surface rendering) techniques demonstrated in this approach are also very useful to study the 3D morphology of precipitates and connectivity of microstructural phases in different alloys."
1048,"Electroactive polymer sensors for chiral amines based on optically active 1,1′-binaphthyls",2013-06-01,"Molecular chirality is vital in biological functions and discriminating such chirality is important in organic synthesis, bio-synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and drug development. We developed electroactive chiral sensors by incorporating binaphthol moieties into the polymer main chains. The binaphthyl scaffold of the binaphthol moiety recognizes one form of chirality from the other, and its phenol groups play a vital role in the charge transporting mechanism. Aiming for chiral amine sensors, we synthesized binaphthol-containing electropolymerizable monomers and polymerized to produce proton-dopable chiral polymers, which were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, potentiometry, and in situ conductivity measurements. Chiral discriminating ability of the resulting polymers was tested and their sensing mechanism was proposed."
1049,"Photoluminescence properties and white emission of Dy , Tm : NaY (WO) phosphors",2013-06-01,"Dy3+ and Tm3+/Dy3+: NaY (WO4)2 phosphors have been synthesized by high-temperature solid-phase sintering method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and photoluminescence (PL) properties of the phosphors were used to characterize the samples. Under UV radiation (352 nm) excitation, the sample Dy3+: NaY (WO4)2 phosphors perform a blue emission at 474 nm and yellow emission at 574 nm, and the intensity of blue emission is significantly weaker than that of yellow emission. The sample as a whole shows yellow emission. Tm3+ and Dy3+ ions co-doped NaY (WO4)2 sample is expected to obtain the better color purity of white emission because the emission at 450 nm corresponding to the transition 1D2·3F4 of Tm3+ ions can effectively improve blue emission portion. By adjusting the doping concentration of Tm3+ and Dy3+ ions, the better color purity of white emission is obtained from Tm3+/Dy3+: NaY (WO4)2 phosphors. The study on the luminescence mechanism showed that there is the energy transfer between Tm3+ and Dy3+ in Tm3+/Dy3+: NaY (WO4)2 phosphors."
1050,Properties of MoO films by thermal oxidation: Annealing induced phase transition,2013-06-01,"Thin films of molybdenum oxide were grown by thermal oxidation of DC magnetron sputtered metallic molybdenum films. The deposited molybdenum metal (Mo) films were annealed in air at different temperatures in the range of 473–673 K. The effect of annealing temperature on the structural, morphological, electrical, optical and electrochemical properties was systematically investigated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman studies conformed that the molybdenum films annealed at 573 K leads to the growth of mixed phase of β- and α-MoO3. While those films annealed at 673 K showed single phase of α-MoO3. The α-MoO3 films were of polycrystalline nature with crystallite size of 22 nm and optical band gap of 3.31 eV. The electrical resistivity of the Mo films is 6 × 10–5 cm and it was increased to 3.2 × 10–3 cm when the films annealed at 673 K. From the electrochemical studies, it is observed that, the films annealed at 673 K showed good electrochromic and cyclic voltammetric response."
1051,Aqueous soluble boron nitride nanosheets via anionic compound-assisted exfoliation,2013-06-01,"Few-layered boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) were prepared in presence of poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) or sodium perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylate as dispersion and stabilization agents in water by exfoliation of commercial bulk h-BN powder. Taking advantages of the hydrophobic and/or π-stacking interactions between BNNS surface and aromatic rings in dispersion agents, the resulting BNNS dispersion was homogenous and stable for a month without precipitation. Microscopic and spectroscopic results revealed that the bulk h-BN materials were intercalated and exfoliated down to 1–2 nm thick sheets. This study provided a facile and efficient method to produce BNNSs in aqueous solution."
1052,"Effective gene delivery to mesenchymal stem cells using a synthesized vector, chitosan-linked-polyethylenimine",2013-06-01,"The current study aimed to examine the transfection ability of chitosan-linked-polyethylenimine (PEI) (CP), a newly synthesized PEI derivative, in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Firstly, series of CP/DNA complex with different charge ratio (N/P) were prepared, and the physiochemical properties, such as particle size and the zeta potential of this vector, were measured. Analysis of its physicochemical properties demonstrated that the modified PEI polymers were able to form nanoparticles with DNA whose particle size ranging from 110–140 nm. And their surface charge decreased to about 24 mV. Then, the in vitro cellular internalization was observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope, followed by the transfection efficiency examination in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Also, its cytotoxicity was compared with that of PEI by MTT assay. It was found that the novel CP polymer exhibited higher transfection efficiency and relatively lower cytotoxicity in MSCs than the control. Finally, the transfection of TGF-β1 based on CP was proved to successfully induce the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in vitro. In conclusion, that the newly synthesized CP can form a complex with DNA, and had compatible physicochemical properties for use as a gene delivery system. Our result demonstrated that the CP would be a very attractive non-viral vector which can be utilized in MSCs."
1053,Material realization of topological crystalline insulators: Role of strain and spin-orbit coupling,2013-06-01,"Taking into consideration of the mirror symmetry gives rise to a new phase of quantum matter, called topological crystalline insulator (TCI). Here, using SnTe and PbTe as the examples, we give detailed insight into the effects of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and strain on the formation of the TCI. A strain-induced band inversion, without any SOC, is shown. The SOC, however, is indispensable for achieving the TCI phase in real materials and can promote the process of the band inversion. Detailed surface state analysis reveals that topological surface state is thickness dependent and the Dirac point can locate precise on or slightly away from the mirror-symmetry point. Our results pave a way of the material realization of new topological crystalline insulator."
1054,Analysis of impact of sintering time on microstructure of LSM-YSZ composite cathodes by X-ray nanotomography,2013-06-01,"The ability to visualize three-dimensional (3D) microstructural changes in cathodes caused by processing can help elucidate the impact of microstructure on cathode performance. This study presents the utilization of a nano computed tomography (nano-CT) technique to image the 3D microstructures of four (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3 yttria-stabilized zirconia composite cathodes, which were sintered for 1, 2, 3 and 4 h at 1423 K, respectively. Based on the 3D reconstructions obtained, key structural parameters, such as the solid-to-pore volume ratio of LSM-YSZ, surface area and tortuosity, were calculated. Studying the 3D microstructural changes in cathodes submitted to different sintering times may provide a new method of exploring the relationship between processing conditions and cathode performance."
1055,Amorphous titanium dioxide ultra-thin films for self-cleaning surfaces,2013-06-01,"The overall goal of our research is to develop self-cleaning surfaces on a glass substrate. The self-cleaning surfaces described in this work are based on titanium dioxide coatings. Crystalline titanium dioxide in the anatase form appears to be the most photoactive and the most practical of the semiconductors for widespread environmental photocatalytic applications. However, amorphous TiO2 has been rarely investigated, even though it can be deposited without heating. In this paper, the UV- induced hydrophilicity of amorphous TiO2 thin films obtained by magnetron sputtering deposition were studied in relation to film thickness and nitrogen dopants. The effect of UV light irradiation on the film hydrophilicity was strong and independent of nitrogen dopants or thickness. Surface topography, particle size and film structure were determined by atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction."
1056,Effect of NaBH concentration and synthesis temperature on the performance of Pd/C catalyst for formic acid electro-oxidation,2013-06-01,"The highly dispersed and active Pd/C catalysts for formic acid electro-oxidation were prepared by an ethylene glycol-assisted NaBH4 reduction method. In order to investigate the effect of the reducing agent concentration and synthesis temperature, Pd ions were reduced with different NaBH4 concentrations for which the molar ratios of NaBH4 to metal ions were controlled to 75, 100, 125 and 150 at 20, 35 and 50 °C, respectively. Their physical properties were characterized by XRD and TEM. And their electrochemical performances for formic acid electro-oxidation were tested by linear sweeping voltammetry. It is found that both the NaBH4 concentration and synthesis temperature can affect the crystal size and dispersion of Pd/C catalysts. The x125-20 catalyst prepared with the molar ratio of NaBH4 to Pd metal = 125 at 20 °C has the smallest crystal size of about 3.3 nm, and presents the highest catalytic activity (1851 mA · mg–1 Pd at 0.2 V vs. SCE) for formic acid electro-oxidation."
1057,Decoupling epitaxial graphene from SiC(0001) by liquid-phase fluorine intercalation,2013-06-01,"We propose a liquid-phase fluorine-intercalation method for decoupling epitaxial graphene (EG) grown on SiC(0001) by only immersing EG sample into a mixture solution with HF, HNO3, and Mo plates. The results show that after fluorination, the XPS intensity ratio of C 1s from graphene and SiC significantly increases; moreover, it almost disappeared for the XPS component of the interfacial buffer layer corresponding to the C atoms bonded to the Si atoms of SiC substrate. It is unambiguous that the fluorine atoms intercalate between the buffer layer and SiC substrate, which decouples the graphene layer from the SiC substrate and leads to the increase of the thickness of the graphene layer. It is promising for this liquid-phase fluorine-intercalation method to decouple EG from the SiC(0001) and convert partial of the buffer layer to the graphene layer."
1058,Adsorption of proteins in channels of carbon nanotubes: Effect of surface chemistry,2013-03-01,"The adsorption of molecules in a confined environment (pores and narrow channels) differs from adsorption on flat surfaces. While the immobilization of proteins on porous carbon and the transport of protein molecules through carbon nanotube channels are of great practical importance, the interaction of proteins with the carbon surface in confinement is poorly understood. In this study the adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was studied in carbon nanotubes grown by chemical vapor deposition in cylindrical pores of anodic alumina membranes. BSA adsorption depends on the channel diameter of the carbon nanotubes, the termination of nanotube surfaces (surface chemistry), and the pH of medium. Amination of the carbon surface leads to increased adsorption of the proteins at neutral pH, while oxidation decreases the sorption capacity. The differences have been explained by favorable or unfavorable electrostatic interactions between protein molecules and the carbon surface."
1059,"Aqueous route for the synthesis of platinum, ruthenium and ceria nanoparticles on multi-walled carbon nanotubes for the electrooxidation of methanol and ethanol",2013-03-01,"The electrochemical oxidation of methanol and ethanol in acidic media was studied using electrodes composed of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) decorated with Pt, Ru and ceria nanoparticles. Polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) was used to disperse the MWCNTs in water and provide nucleation sites for the growth of catalyst nanoparticles. Composite electrodes were characterized for structural and electrochemical properties and all electrodes modified with Ru displayed greater catalytic ability for alcohol oxidation than those without Ru. In addition, the inclusion of ceria seemed to increase the catalytic ability in every sample suggesting a synergistic effect between Pt, Ru and ceria for the oxidation of methanol and ethanol. The catalytic effect of Pt and Ru concentration was studied by holding Ru concentrations constant and increasing the concentration of Pt. The same concentration of ceria was used for all modified electrodes. The results of this study show that the electrode prepared from 3:1 Pt:Ru solutions with ceria showed the highest peak current density for methanol oxidation (at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl/Cl– which was nearly 20 times greater than that for an unmodified Pt electrode. Similar results were seen for ethanol oxidation on the same electrode which resulted in peak current densities greater than 20 times those for the unmodified Pt electrode at 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl/Cl–."
1060,Intensive synergetic Cs adsorbent incorporated with polymer spongiform for scalable purification without post filtration,2013-03-01,"Here we report a newly developed synergetic adsorbent consisting of ferrocyanides, diatomites, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The synergetic adsorbents are objectively designed to adsorb extremely dilute cesium (Cs) effectively. These adsorbents are impregnated into polymer spongiform, which eliminates the need for post filtration of the adsorbent and solute mixtures and simplifies the water-purification procedure. Radioactive particles were chosen to evaluate the performance of these synergetic adsorbents since radioactive cesium (137Cs) could be quantified in extremely low concentrations in aqueous solutions. These adsorbents prepared in combination with CNTs demonstrate much higher adsorption of Cs from water, as compared to adsorbents without CNTs. This high level of performance was also verified by 137Cs adsorption in pure and sea water. This study suggests that CNTs contribute to an enhancement of the adsorption performance in which mesopore effects appear to enrich solutes around the synergetic adsorbents."
1061,Sodium ion battery anode properties of empty and C-inserted single-walled carbon nanotubes,2013-03-01,"The structural changes of three different Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube (SWCNT) samples (open- and closed-end, and C60-peapod SWCNT samples) with Na doping were investigated by Raman scattering and XRD measurements. It was found that the sodium atoms are inserted into the nanotube hollow core space in the case of open-end SWCNTs. The Na ion battery anode properties of the three samples were also investigated by electrochemical measurements. These results show that the space inside the SWCNTs cannot function electrochemically as sodium ion adsorption sites. However, it was found that the reversible sodium ion storage capacity of the C60-peapod sample is much larger than that of an empty tube."
1062,Depolarized dynamic light scattering study of multi-walled carbon nanotubes in solution,2013-03-01,Evaluation of size and morphology of carbon nanotubes in solution has been one of the key issues for their applications. Here we investigate the dispersion states of several multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in aqueous solutions by the depolarized dynamic light scattering (DDLS) technique. The estimated size and morphology by monitoring the rotational diffusion and the translational diffusion are compared with those obtained by transmission electron microscope (TEM) image analysis. Agreement between the DDLS and TEM results suggest that DDLS is a quite powerful tool for evaluating the morphology of MWCNTs in solutions.
1063,Presence of stable carbon centric free radicals and ferromagnetic elements in the antennae and the wings of nocturnal silk moth: A magnetic nanostructure for magneto sensing,2013-03-01,"This work addresses an interesting, interdisciplinary problem of nature- “the mechanism by which animal senses the earth's magnetic field and navigate”. Currently there are two existing theories trying to explain, “How the animal senses the magnetic field of earth”. One theory is based on the presence of biogenic magnetic materials in the body of the animals. Such magnetic materials which are present inside the body, orients itself according to the earth's weak magnetic field and convey the information to the nervous system to develop the navigational map. The second theory is based on a light dependent photochemical reaction. A photochemical reaction leads to the generation of radical pairs, which helps in sensing the weak magnetic field of the earth. In this work, we are proposing a new model of magnetoreception. Unlike the existing radical pair system of magnetoreception, where a light-dependent reaction is essential to generate free radicals, here we show the presence of a large pool of stable carbon-centric free radicals in the nano-domains of the antennae and the wings of silk moth. This stable pool of carbon-centric free radicals is intrinsic in the nano-domains of these anatomical structures and responds to weak magnetic fields similar to that of Earth's (50 μT) even in the absence of light. Hence we are proposing that nocturnal animals in their navigation could utilize such a light independent mechanism. We further observed the presence of ferromagnetic elements (Fe, Ni, Co, Mn) in these structures. In conclusion, we have discussed how carbon centric free radicals along with other ferromagnetic components present in the antennae and the wings of the nocturnal silk moth, might help them to avoid the bats."
1064,Growth of carbon octopus-like structures from carbon black in a fluidized bed,2013-03-01,"Carbon octopi like structures have been grown by catalytic conversion of carbon black in a fluidized bed with the help of ferrocene and acetylene. A growth mechanism has been proposed based on small-angle neutron scattering, scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope observations. Addition of carbon black primary particles into multiple nuclei of carbon cap on iron particles led the growth of these structures. It was concluded that the pentagon and heptagon defects in the carbon black have important roles in converting the spherical structure into a cylindrical structure."
1065,Spectroscopic properties of Dy-doped oxyfluoride glasses for white light emitting diodes,2013-03-01,Dy3+-doped oxyfluoride (NbFSDy: SiO2–Nb2O5–K2O–ZnF2–LiF–Dy2O3 glasses were prepared by meltquenching technique and their spectroscopic properties have been investigated. Glass transition and crystallization temperatures have been determined. Phonon energy and vibrational groups of the host matrix have been analyzed from the Raman spectrum. Judd-Ofelt analysis has been carried out to obtain intensity parameters which are used to predict radiative properties for the 1.0 mol% of Dy2O3 doped glass. The characteristic emission parameters such as effective bandwidth and the stimulated emission cross-section have also been intended from the emission spectra for the 4F9/2 level of Dy3+ ions. Sharp emission peaks were observed at 485 nm (blue) of 4F9/2→6H15/2 and 577 nm (yellow) of 4F9/2→6H13/2 transitions under different pump wavelengths. The CIE co-ordinates for an optimal concentration (0.1 mol% of Dy2O3) were fallen in the white light region for all the pump wavelengths. The correlated color temperature decreases from 5593 K (closer to the day light value of 5500 K) to 5003 K with increase in pump wavelengths. These results indicate that 0.1 mol% Dy2O3-doped glass can be considered for the development of white light emitting diodes.
1066,Spectroscopy and 1.47 m emission properties of Tm-doped metaphosphate laser glasses,2013-03-01,"The present study reports spectroscopic properties of Tm3+-doped metaphosphate based glasses prepared by melt quenching technique. Raman analysis has been carried out to investigate various structural groups and phonon energy of the host matrix. The observed energy levels of Tm3+ ions in these glasses have been analysed through a semi-empirical free-ion Hamiltonian model. Judd-Ofelt analysis has been carried out using the absorption spectrum of 1.0 mol% Tm3+-doped glasses to evaluate Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters and in turn predicted radiative properties for potential emission states of Tm3+ ion. Visible and near infrared emission intensities have been measured with varying Tm3+ ion concentration. The near infrared emission spectra exhibit strong band at 1.47 μm, useful for telecommunication systems. From the effective bandwidths of emission transitions and radiative transition probabilities, stimulated emission cross-sections for1 D2 → 3F4 and 3H4 →3F4 transitions have been determined to be 3.07 and 3.37 (×10–21 cm2), respectively. The decay curves for the 1D2 and 3H4 levels of Tm3+ ion have been recorded by monitoring the emissions at 454 nm and 1470 nm, respectively. The radiative lifetimes for 1D2 and 3H4 levels of Tm3+ ion have been compared with experimental lifetimes and the differences between experimental values and the theoretical predictions have been discussed. The results suggest that the present glasses could be useful for visible and telecommunication applications."
1067,Innate approach for fabrication of nickel oxide nanocomposite in pellet form and their electric properties,2013-03-01,"We unveil a new approach for synthesis of nickel oxide–polymer nanocomposite in pellet form via the solid-state reaction route. An engineering thermoplastic, polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) was used as the polymer network. The as-obtained pellets of nickel oxide nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction and field emission electron microscopy. The XRD and FESEM images exhibited structural and morphological information dependent on the weight of the pellets. TEM images of the powders disclose the size distribution as well as the extent of distribution of NiO nanoparticles in PPS matrix. Magnetometry studies of the nanocomposite disclose magnetic nature based on the nanoscale size effect. Furthermore, the bulk resistivity measurements of the fabricated pellets reveal the changes in resistivity in accordance with the structural, morphological as well as microstructural variation. These results indicate that the unique strategy of fabrication of nickel oxide nanocomposite pellets may be helpful in improving the thermo-electrical properties of the composite based devices which may be conceivable for use in advanced industrial applications such as supercapacitors and sensors."
1068,Diameter-controlled growth and impurity doping of silver colloid-seeded silicon microwires to nanowires for the realization of solar cell materials,2013-03-01,Silicon (Si) microwires to nanowires were synthesized by chemical vapour deposition using silver (Ag) colloid catalyzed growth techniques. Control over diameter was achieved by varying the growth temperature while remaining far below the eutectic temperature of Ag colloids-Si system. Low-temperature growth of these nanowires demonstrates a vapour-solid–solid growth mechanism rather than a vapour-liquid–solid growth mechanism. Boron (B) acceptors and phosphorus (P) donor doping were carried out to make p-type and n-type Si wires. B local vibrational peaks and Fano broadening in optical phonon peaks of micro Raman scattering and electron spin resonance signals from the conduction electrons were used to demonstrate B and P atom doping respectively. These results will be important for future integration where Si wires can be combined as p-n junction for light harvesting material in next generation Si based solar cells.
1069,Coulomb blockade behavior in nanostructured graphene with direct contacts,2013-03-01,"This paper proposes a new graphene-based quantum-dot device structure, in which nanostructured graphene islands are perfectly isolated and metallic contacts are directly deposited onto them without constrictions. Such a configuration is expected to be free from disturbances resulting from the structural fluctuation of constrictions, and allows for direct contact with a nanostructured two-dimensional electron gas. Transport spectroscopy analysis of this device structure was performed, and its Coulomb blockade behavior at low temperatures was revealed. Irregular Coulomb diamonds are observed in these devices, which is an indication of the formation of a multiple-quantum-dot system."

1071,Fluorescent Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Core–Shell Nanoprobes for Multimodal Cellular Imaging,2012-12-01,"Multimodal imaging agents that combine magnetic and fluorescent imaging capabilities are desirable for the high spatial and temporal resolution. In the present work, we report the synthesis of multifunctional fluorescent ferrofluids using iron oxide as the magnetic core and rhodamine B as fluorochrome shell. The core–shell structure was designed in such a way that fluorescence quenching due to the inner magnetic core was minimized by an intermediate layer of silica. The intermediate passive layer of silica was realized by a novel method which involves the esterification reaction between the epoxy group of prehydrolysed 3-Glyidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane and the surfactant over iron oxide. The as-synthesized ferrofluids have a high saturation magnetization in the range of 62–65 emu/g and were found to emit light of wavelength 640 nm (λ excitation = 446 nm). Time resolved life time decay analysis showed a bi-exponential decay pattern with an increase in the decay life time in the presence of intermediate silica layer. Cytotoxicity studies confirmed the cell viability of these materials. The in vitro MRI imaging illustrated a high contrast when these multimodal nano probes were employed and the R2 relaxivity of these sample was found to be 334 mM−1s−1 which reveals its high potential as a T2 contrast enhancing agent."
1072,Glucose Stabilized Magnetic Palladium Nanoparticles Exhibiting Enhanced Magnetic Properties Under Exposure to Hydrogen,2012-12-01,"H2[PdII(Cl)4] and [PdIV(NH3)4Cl2]Cl2 as starting materials produce palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) using hydroxylamine as reducing agent in aquous solvent in the presence of D-glucose as stabiliser and capping agent. Pd NPs with average 6 nm size was isolated from Pd(II) complex whereas the average Pd NPs of 8 nm was produced from Pd(IV) under similar reaction condition. These Pd NPs are characterized by UV–Vis, FT-IR, XRD, TEM and SEM and EDX studies. Magnetism of 6 nm sized Pd NPs show enhanced ferromagnetic behavior compared to those from 8 nm sized Pd NPs. On hydrogen exposure smaller sized Pd NPs show an increase in magnetization."
1073,Solubility and Surface Interactions of RF Plasma Polymerized Polyterpenol Thin Films,2012-12-01,"Organic thin films have myriad of applications in biological interfaces, micro-electromechanical systems and organic electronics. Polyterpenol thin films fabricated via RF plasma polymerization have been substantiated as a promising gate insulating and encapsulating layer for organic optoelectronics, sacrificial place-holders for air gap fabrication as well as antibacterial coatings for medical implants. This study aims to understand the wettability and solubility behavior of the nonsynthetic polymer thin film, polyterpenol. Polyterpenol exhibited monopolar behavior, manifesting mostly electron donor properties, and was not water soluble due to the extensive intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds present. Hydrophobicity of polyterpenol surfaces increased for films fabricated at higher RF power attributed to reduction in oxygen containing functional groups and increased cross linking. The studies carried out under various deposition conditions vindicate that we could tailor the properties of the polyterpenol thin film for a given application."
1074,Multicolor Upconversion Emission and Color Tunability in Tm/Er/Yb Tri-Doped NaNbO Nanocrystals,2012-12-01,"The Tm3+/Er3+/Yb3+: NaNbO3 nanocrystals (NCs) were synthesized using sol–gel method and the nanocrystallite sizes of about 70 nm were estimated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results of the XRD revealed that the powders remained as a single orthorhombic structure at doping concentrations below 7.5% of Yb3+. A second phase of YbNbO4 begins to appear at 10%. Studies of photoluminescence properties with respect to ion concentration as well as laser pump power were carried out. The upconversion (UC) emission spectra of NCs show white luminescence and color tunability composed with multicolor combination of red, green and blue emissions under excitation at 970 nm. The red and green UC is consistent with 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 and 2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ ions, while the blue and near infrared (800 nm) UC originate from 1G4 → 3H6 and 3H4 → 3H6 transitions of Tm3+ ions, respectively. Change in UC luminescence intensity and multicolor tunability with respect to Ln3+ concentration as well as pump powers in Tm3+/Er3+/Yb3+ tri-doped NaNbO3 NCs were discussed and calculated the CIE color coordinates as well. From the present results we point out the direction to tailor the system for an efficient white light generation."

Upon excitation at 390 nm, the Sr8MgLu(PO4)7:Eu2+ phosphor exhibits an asymmetric broad yellow emission centered at 594 nm and the composition-optimized concentration of Eu2+ in Sr8MgLu(PO4)7:Eu2+ was determined to be 0.5 mol%. The excitation spectrum of this phosphor has a broadband absorption in the 250–450 nm NUV region, which matches well with NUV chips. A white-light LED, fabricated using a NUV LED 390 nm chip pumped by a blend of yellow-emitting Sr8MgLu(PO4)7:0.005Eu2+ and blue-emitting BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ phosphors, resulted in an excellent color rendering index of 95.4 and Commission International I'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates of (0.336, 0.353) at a correlated color temperature of 5354 K.

1076,Reversible Aggregation Control of Polyvinylpyrrolidone Capped Gold Nanoparticles as a Function of pH,2012-12-01,"A simple procedure has been developed for aggregation of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capped gold nanoparticles by controlling the pH of the solution. PVP-capped gold nanoparticles were synthesized via wet chemical method. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-vis spectroscopy techniques were employed for determining the morphological features and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the gold nanoparticles. When the pH of the solution containing PVP-capped gold nanoparticles was changed from 6.7 to 1.0, the color of the solution changed from deep red to blue due to SPR weakening by particle aggregate formation. The color of the solution returned to its original red when the pH of the solution was brought back to 6.7. Furthermore, citrate protection of the gold nanoparticles was found to inhibit the reverse action. This reversible/irreversible-selectable structural control of gold nanoparticles with drastic changes in their optical absorption characteristics may find various nanophotonic applications including contactless pH detection."
1077,Hot-Injection Synthesis of Bactericidal Sn-Doped TiO Nanospheres for Visible-Light Photocatalysis,2012-12-01,"Sn-doped (5, 10, 15, and 20 at.%) TiO2 nanospheres have been synthesized by hot-injection method and the optimum doping level for visible light photocatalyis is found to be 15%. The energy dispersive X-ray spectrum confirms the presence of Sn and its composition in the prepared nanospheres. The X-ray diffraction pattern reveals Sn-doping of TiO2 which is in rutile phase. Replacement of Ti4+ by Sn4+ results in enlargement of unit cell volume. The doped oxide exhibits blue as well as green emission due to oxygen vacancies. The specific conductance and capacitance of 15% Sn-doped TiO2 are larger than those of pristine TiO2. The synthesized nanosphere is also found to act as a bactericide; it kills E. coli cells effectively in the absence of direct illumination."
1078,Synthesis and Properties of Tungsten Oxide and Reduced Graphene Oxide Nanocomposites,2012-12-01,"In this paper, we report the synthesis and physical properties of tungsten oxide-reduced graphene oxide (WO3-rGO) nanocomposite. The WO3-rGO nanocomposite was prepared by a simple chemical method and the same was reduced by microwave irradiation. The as-synthesized nanocomposite was characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy techniques. The XRD data confirms that WO3 has tetragonal structure. The optical property was analyzed using UV-Vis and Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Layer defect in rGO was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. The PL results revealed the emission peak at 389 nm and 450 nm for rGO and WO3-rGO nanocomposite, respectively. The photocatalytic characteristic of as-prepared WO3-rGO composite was analyzed via degradation of Methylene Orange dye at two different concentration of WO3-rGO (1 mg and 5 mg). Thermo gravimetric analysis results revealed the higher thermal stability of WO3-rGO nanocomposite. The presence of functional groups was identified by Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectroscopy. Our results demonstrate the potential application of WO3-rGO nanocomposite in photocatalysis."
1079,Growth and Properties of CdSe Nanoparticles on Ellagic Acid Biotemplates for Photodegradation Applications,2012-12-01,"The development of new materials for degradation of toxic waste is of major significance from an environmental standpoint. In this work, natural plant polyphenol based microassemblies, specifically Ellagic Acid (EA) assemblies were utilized as templates for the growth of CdSe nanoparticles. It was found that EA assemblies efficiently bound to cadmium ions by complexation with the phenolic hydroxyl groups, allowing the formation of CdSe nanoparticles coated EA assemblies in the subsequent step. The nanoparticles formed uniformly coated the templates and were in the size range of 20–30 nm. The binding interactions of the nanoparticles with EA were explored by various spectroscopic and microscopic methods. Further, the thermal stability and the ability of the nanocomposites to photodegrade alizarin red, a model toxic aromatic compound was examined. It was found that alizarin red was degraded efficiently in the presence of the CdSe nanoparticle bound to EA assemblies. Thus, we have created a new class of nanocomposites that may have potential applications in the degradation of toxic aromatic compounds for environmental remediation."
1080,Optical and Electrical Properties of Wurtzite Copper Indium Sulfide Nanoflakes,2012-12-01,"Raman spectroscopic analysis and Hall measurement of wurtzite copper indium sulfide (CuInS2) were carried out. Nanocrystalline wurtzite CuInS2 (CIS) was synthesized by a solvothermal reaction route for these studies. It is observed that the amount of sulfur source, time and temperature of the reaction are the key to control wurtzite phase formation of CuInS2. Wurtzite nanoflakes were formed at 150 °C, with ethylenediamine as the selected solvent and the ratio of Cu:In:S precursor was kept at 1.1:1:5. The Hall measurement resulted in sheet resistivity, ρ, of ∼2 × 105 Ω/sq, Hall coefficient of ∼10 m2/C, mobility of ∼0.5 cm2/V-s and hole concentration of ∼7 × 1013/cm2. Slight shift in the Raman spectra of 1–2 cm−1 was observed between wurtzite and roquesite CuInS2 and was attributed to the stoichiometric variation in Cu/In and/or changes in the chemical environments of the two crystal structures."
1081,Defect Induced Changes in the Linear and Non-Linear Optical Properties of ZnO Nanotetrapods,2012-12-01,"Here, we investigate the origin of green luminescence in ZnO nanotetrapods using nonlinear optical z-scan measurements in tandem with photoluminescence measurements. To this end, we synthesized ZnO nanotetrapods using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process, annealed at temperatures below 200 °C in O2, Ar, and Zn metal vapor and measured the ensuing optical properties. Our z-scan measurements show that all samples exhibit an effective three-photon absorption (3PA). Furthermore, the 3PA coefficient varies with the incident laser intensity consistent with the presence of real mid-gap states. Interestingly, the rate of change for the 3PA coefficient is strongly influenced by the annealing conditions. Annealing in Zn vapor (Ar and O2 leads to an increase (decrease) in green luminescence and the 3PA coefficient, strongly suggesting that the Zn interstitials are involved in the mechanism of green luminescence."
1082,Structural and Electrical Properties of Ozone Irradiated Carbon Nanotube Yarns and Sheets,2012-12-01,"Poor electrical conductivity of carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn and sheets has been one of the main hurdles in their practical application. Here, we demonstrate that the ozone irradiation can be an effective approach to reduce the resistivity of spun CNTs bundle with oxidization and induced defects. The CNT yarn and sheet are fabricated from a spinnable vertically aligned CNT forest synthesized by a thermal chemical vapor deposition. The electrical resistance of a CNT yarn and sheet reduces with a certain period of ozone irradiation; however for a long duration of ozone irradiation resistance increases with structural deformation of the CNTs. A comparative study on the effect of shapes between the CNT yarn and sheet with morphological change in the CNTs due to the ozone irradiation is performed. It was observed that the desorption energy of ozone molecules was slightly large for the CNT yarn due to the difference of adsorption sites. The fraction of defects induced by the ozone irradiated on the CNT yarn was estimated from the ultimate resistance change with temperature and Raman spectroscopy."

1084,Photovoltaic Properties of a-Si:H Films Grown by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition: A Review,2012-09-01,"Amorphous silicon films are currently receiving a worldwide renewed and intense research and commercial focus for low-cost solar power generation. In this article we review the history and current status of hydrogenated amorphous silicon films (a-Si:H) for thin film photovoltaics, and the role of intrinsic a-Si:H films in heterojunction (a-Si:H/c-Si) solar cells. The focus of this article is on plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) of these films from silane (SiH4). Very high frequency (VHF) PECVD deposition and its limitations are discussed. Properties and requirements of intrinsic and doped a-Si:H films are presented. Light-induced degradation of a-Si:H films are reviewed in detail. Current status of single junction a-Si:H solar cells and factors influencing cell performance are also discussed. Since the efficiency and stability of thin film a-Si:H solar cells are low, a-Si:H films can be successfully used in other solar cell technologies such as c-Si based back heterojunction solar cells, where doped a-Si:H films are used at the rear side of the substrate for emitter and back surface field."
1085,A Review on Lithium-Ion Batteries Safety Issues: Existing Problems and Possible Solutions,2012-09-01,"Lithium-ion batteries have been considered to be the most competitive power source of electric vehicles (EV), hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and energy storage of green grid. However, as a solution to high energy density storage, lithium-ion batteries have been seriously plagued by the safety issues. In this paper, several key facts and corresponding mechanisms of battery safety issues, including overcharge, thermal runaway, lithium dendrites, current collector dissolution and gas evolution are detailed discussed. Additionally, based on the discussed safety issues, a few of efficient solutions to preventing safety issues, including redox shuttle, flame-retardant (FR) electrolyte additive and positive temperature coefficient (PTC) device, are introduced in brief.

1086,Temperature Dependent Thermal Conductivity Increase of Aqueous Nanofluid with Single Walled Carbon Nanotube Inclusion,2012-09-01,"We investigated the thermal and electrical conductivity of water seeded with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) synthesized using the alcohol catalytic chemical vapour deposition method. Sodium deoxycholate was used as the surfactant to prepare stable nanofluids, which we then thoroughly characterized by microscopic and spectroscopic methods. Electrical conductivity measurements showed power law dependence with respect to SWCNT loading, while the thermal conductivity increase showed a linear dependence on loading. The effective thermal conductivity of the nanofluid was also found to increase with increasing temperature. Viscosity of the nanofluids showed a threefold increase compared to the thermal conductivity increase, which may play a crucial role in utilizing this fluid for practical applications. We compare experimental results with existing analytical models and discuss the critical role of thermal boundary resistance, which limits the improvement in thermal conductivity. Influence of SWCNT aggregation in the increase of effective thermal conductivity is also discussed."
1087,"One-Pot Synthesis of Highly Emissive, Green-to-Red (ZnS) -Cu InS /ZnS Core/Shell Nanoparticles via Surfactant Induced Nucleation Process",2012-09-01,"A novel synthetic protocol is developed to prepare highly emissive zinc copper indium sulphide (ZCIS) core/shell nanoparticles of configuration of (ZnS) x  -Cu0.1 InS1.55 /ZnS via one-pot reaction of Zn(S2 CNEt2 2, CuI, 1-dodecanthiol and In(CH3 COO)3. Although each of these reagents has been exploited for the ZCIS synthesis in previous studies, the superiority of current method lies in that the ZCIS nucleation won't proceed at temperature as high as 180°C until addition of oleylamine ligand to trigger the overall reaction. The as prepared ZCIS core is able to maintain the compositional homogeneity (emission fwhm <95 nm) and similar optical properties during a long period of reaction time (≥ 60 min), so that subsequent cationic exchange can be conveniently carried out to form the ZnS shell. The resulting core/shell alloy nanoparticles all exhibit high emission quantum yield (f > 40%) and emission is tunable from green to red depending on elemental composition. In particular, the green one (∼530 nm), with f ∼;42% is the highest recorded to date. This surfactant induced one-pot reaction also offers scale-up advantage, with 1.6 (green), 2.27 (yellow) and 2.52 (red) grams per reaction being successfully made."

It is a well known insulator which has been used as a spacer layer in electronic circuits and magnetic tunnel junctions. We report room temperature ferromagnetism in undoped, and V doped MgO nanoparticles of the same size (∼ 39 nm diameter) produced by a two-step chemical process, but containing nominal 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1, 1.1, and 1.5 at.% V. Strikingly, the saturation magnetization shows an anomalous abrupt increase in its value to 80.2 memu/g for the 1 at% V doped nanoparticles. Also, high resolution TEM studies show that on doping with V the lattice parameters, d111 in particular, increases from 2.42 Å [MgO] to 2.47 Å in the case of [MgO:V(1%)]. These results are consistent with recent theoretical predictions on a first principles basis which suggests that the observed ferromagnetism is sensitively dependent on the distance between the V Mg – V Mg.

1089,Novel CuO/TiO Nanocomposite Films with a Graded Band Gap for Visible Light Irradiation,2012-09-01,"CuO/TiO2 nanocomposite film with a graded band gap was designed and synthesized by varying the composition of CuO/TiO2 molar rate from the substrate to the surface along the depth direction using the sol–gel method. The as-synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and voltage–current (V – I) analyses. The results demonstrated that the chemical compositions of CuO/TiO2 upgraded nanocomposite film achieved gradient composition along the thickness direction, the absorption edge for CuO/TiO2 nanocomposite film had a red shift which moved towards the visible light region, and the photoelectrochemical properties of the nanocomposite film was evidently improved comparing with that of TiO2 film. The experimental result provided an intriguing perspective on the development of the thin film solar cell."
1090,Fabrication of Highly Dense Nanoholes by Self-Assembled Gallium Droplet on Silicon Surface,2012-09-01,We report the fabrication of nanoholes on silicon surface by exploiting the solubility of silicon in gallium by local droplet etching. Nanometer-sized gallium droplets yield nanoholes when annealed in ultrahigh vacuum at moderate temperatures (∼ 500°C) without affecting the other regions. High vacuum and moderate annealing temperatures are key parameters to obtain well-defined nanoholes with diameter comparable to that of Ga droplets. Selfassembly of Ga droplet leads to a nanohole density of 4–8 × 1010/cm2 .
1091,"ZnO/Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) Poly(styrenesulfonate) Based Ultraviolet and Visible Photodetectors: Role of Defects",2012-09-01,"Here, we report the ZnO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) based photodetectors that can response to ultraviolet as well as visible light. The temporal response of the heterostructures for various excitations in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible range are performed. The time constants are found to be excitation-dependent, the response to visible light is better as compared to UV. The reason behind the better response to UV light is the high level of defects present in ZnO as confirmed by the photoluminescence (PL) measurements. This is corroborated by the time resolved fluorescence (TRF) measurements which provides sufficient information behind the slow response time under the UV excitations. The possible explanation being the non-radiative recombinations occurring due to the traps or impurities present in the film which slows down the photoresponse."
1092,Vertically-Aligned Carbon Nanotube Growth Using Closely Packed Iron Oxide Nanoparticles,2012-09-01,"A high density of catalyst nanoparticles is essential to grow vertically-aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs). We have grown vertically-aligned CNTs on silicon, thermally-oxidized silicon as well as alumina substrates by arranging iron oxide nanoparticles in two-dimensional close-packed structure with a density of 1.5 × 1012 cm–2. Use of toluene as solvent together with uniform diameter oxide nanoparticles is the key to obtain the close-packed configuration. Even after Ar/H2 annealing treatment, the density of the iron oxide nanoparticles remained as 7.0– 9.5 × 1011 cm – 2. We synthesized submillimeter-order heights of multi-walled CNTs on each substrate using acetylene as a carbon source for chemical vapor deposition."

The antibacterial effect, characterized using Chlorophenols Arthrobacter (C. A), showed that both SNP/MS and SNP/MWNT composites exhibit strong antibacterial activity that makes them useful especially in water filtration."
1096,Synthesis of CuAlS Nanocrystals and Their Application in Bio-Imaging,2012-06-01,"We have synthesized and characterized novel semiconductor nanocrystals of CuAlS2 using simple colloidal route. These nanocrystals exhibited excellent luminescence on par with heavy metal based nanocrystals at green region of visible spectrum. We have successfully accomplished biofunctionalization by using polyethylene glycol moieties thereby rendering biocompatibility to these novel nanocrystals. In addition, by nano-engineering their surface with polyethylene glycol-folate, we could drive these nanocrystals towards over expressed folate receptor cancer cells with high specificity. The utility of these bio-functionalized nanocrystals in cancer imaging was elucidated by confocal studies. We anticipate that these surface modified nanocrystals could be used in diagnostic imaging arena of cancer due to their biocompatibility and stable luminescent property in near future."
1097,Carbon Nano-Onions as Nontoxic and High-Fluorescence Bioimaging Agent in Food Chain—An  Study from Unicellular  to Multicellular ,2012-06-01,"Carbon nano-onions, as a newly-emergent member of the carbon family, have attracted attention in its both dry and wet applications. Here we report in vivo effects of water-soluble carbon nano-onions (wsCNOs) introduced in common food web of two model organisms: unicellular Escherichia coli (E. coli) and multicellular Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). At first, CNOs are fed to E. coli and, subsequently, the E. coli are fed to C. elegans. It is found that wsCNOs serve as highly-fluorescent bioimaging agent. The results do not reflect any toxic effect of wsCNOs on the growth of these organisms suggesting new avenues in nanotoxicology research and biomedical application including drug delivery."
1098,Adhesive Microcrystalline Diamond Coating on Surface Modified Non-Carbide Forming Substrate Using Hot Filament CVD,2012-06-01,"Diamond thin films on non-carbide-forming metals such as copper have always had a large research potential because of the technological importance of copper as a substrate as well as its extensive use in microelectronic devices. However, the inability of copper to form carbides as well as the large mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients result in the generation of very high stresses in the coating that lead to delamination, film cracking, or other deleterious effects. We report on a method to increase the adherence of diamond coatings on copper substrates based on a surface modification process. A copper substrate is sandblasted in order to increase the surface roughness and surface area considerably. This process is expected to enhance the mechanical interlocking between the substrate and diamond film and has increased the seed density and surface energy as well. Microcrystalline diamond thin films were deposited on sandblasted copper substrates using hot filament chemical vapor deposition technique. Adhesion property of diamond coatings was evaluated by thermal quench technique combined with Raman spectroscopy."
1099,Immersion Calorimetry Applied to the Study of the Adsorption of Phenolic Derivatives onto Activated Carbon Obtained by Pyrolysis of Potato Peel,2012-06-01,"Activated carbons (ACs) were prepared by pyrolysis of potato peel in the presence of zinc chloride (chemical activation). Room-temperature adsorption of phenol, p -cresol, p -chlorophenol and p -nitrophenol from aqueous solutions at room temperature was investigated. Experimental results show that adsorption capacity depends on carbon surface area and porosity, on the solubility of the different phenolic compounds and on the hydrophobicity of the substituent. The relative affinity of the phenolic compounds towards the carbon surface was correlated to the electron donor-acceptor complexes which are formed between the basic sites on the carbon surface and the aromatic ring of the phenol compounds. As a result, the adsorption capacity began to decrease at a pH value that depended on the difference between the external and internal surface charge density, as measured by electrophoresis and the pH of the slurry, respectively. Eventually, immersion enthalpy was determined for each carbon sample. The values always increase with the relative amount adsorbed at equilibrium (Q e, ranging between 23.5 and 65.4 J/g. Activated carbons with lower total acidity contents show the lowest values, this being related to the different activation treatments carried out by zinc chloride."
1100,Surfactant-Free Hydrothermal Synthesis of Ag/C Nanocables,2012-06-01,"A facile method is described here on synthesis of high-aspect-ratio Ag/C core/sheath nanocables via a hydrothermal process in the presence of Ag2 S and in the absence of any surfactant or polymers. We demonstrate that glucose can act as a reducing reagent and provide carbon source to form a core-shell structure. The S2– ion plays an important role in controlling the Ag+ concentration and then the anisotropic growth of nanocables, and at the same time, the uncoated Ag particles get eroded and reused via Ag2 S intermediate. The formation of 1D Ag nanowire inner core is attributed mainly to the low growth rate of Ag nanocrystalline nuclei and the later carboncoating protection."
1101,Size-Tunable Fabrication of Au Nanodot Arrays via Electrodeposition-Assisted Capillary Force Lithography,2012-06-01,"In this paper, we present a facile means of generating size-controllable Au nanodot arrays employing the electrochemically synthesized nanorings of poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiopene) (PEDOT) within the patterned hole array of polystyrene (PS) template. First, patterned PS array with a diameter of 350 nm is prepared by capillary force lithography. Then, by altering the EDOT monomer concentration, applied potential, or electrodeposition time, PEDOT nanorings with tunable wall thickness are grown inside the PS hole arrays. In addition, by utilizing the nanoholes inside the PEDOT nanorings as a template, Au nanodot arrays with controlled diameter (100~350 nm) can be subsequently fabricated by another electrodeposition process. The successful deposition of Au nanodot arrays is confirmed by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)."

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and photoluminescence properties of the phosphors were investigated in detail. Under UV radiation (322 nm) excitation, the neat samples show a broad blue emission band centered at 420 nm related to Ga-O group in the Y3 Ga5 O12 host. For the Dy 3+ doped Y3 Ga5 O12 phosphors, both the host emission band and characteristic emission of Dy3+ ions can be observed simultaneously. Furthermore, the CIE color coordinates are able to be adjusted around white light by changing the doping concentrations of Dy3+. Preliminary studies shows that the Dy3+ doped Y3 Ga5 O12 phosphors would be a potential candidate as a single component UVconvertible phosphor for white-light-emitting diodes (WLED)."

In order to investigate the influence of oblique incidence on the applications of conventional transmission grating spectrometer in the soft X-ray area, the Kirchhoff diffraction theory with the Fraunhofer approximation is applied and detailed asymmetrical diffraction characteristics are demonstrated. The formation of the asymmetrical diffraction patterns is analyzed with the Fourier optics theory. Various grating structures are performed to explore the optimal structures to minimize the oblique incident influence and this can be a convenient means to control the oblique incident influence in future grating designs."
1104,SiO Nanowire Assemblies Grown by Floating Catalyst Method,2012-06-01,"Silicon oxide (SiO x  nanowire assemblies have been synthesized using anhydrous ferric chloride (FeCl3 as a catalyst precursor and silicon wafers as both the silicon source and substrate by means of float- ing catalyst chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in order to produce different morphologies. It is found that the growth and morphology of SiO x  is strongly temperature-dependent, as tested within the temperature range 1000–1200 C. The sublimation of FeCl3 and its subsequent reduction in the gas phase to produce Fe nanoparticles with high catalytic activity allows for the efficient growth of SiO x  nanowires via vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) mechanism. The prepared amorphous SiO x  nanowires show photoluminescence and emit blue light. This floating catalyst method offers a simple and comprehensive approach for the large-scale production of SiO x  nanostructures with tunable assemblies."

1108,Analytical Investigation of Protein Mediation Between Biomaterials and Cells,2012-03-01,"When biomaterials are implanted into a body, proteins in the body fluid are adsorbed and the body cells adhere on the surfaces. Cells respond differently with different biomaterials. Hence, proper understanding of cellular response to biomaterial surfaces is crucial for successful tissue regeneration and integration. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) is one of the most advanced in situ analyzing techniques to detect interfacial interactions of the protein adlayers between biomaterial surfaces and cells. This review article precisely describes how to analyze interfacial phenomena of the protein adsorption and subsequent cell adhesion using the QCM-D technique. In particular, we focus on understanding the biocompatibility of interfaces by explaining the role of biomaterial surfaces in protein-mediation. The viscoelastic properties of the interfaces are estimated by Voigt-based viscoelastic model obtained from the frequency shift (Δf) and dissipation shift (ΔD) curves. Different protein adsorption and cell adhesion processes have been analyzed to different biomaterial surfaces. This approach clarifies several ambiguities of the interfacial phenomena between biomaterials and cells, and helps to design new biomaterials to be implanted in human body."
1109,Origin of High Power Performance of Mesoporous Carbon–TiO(B) Nanocomposite Electrodes: An  Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction Study of TiO(B) Electrode upon Lithium Insertion,2012-03-01,"Mesoporous carbon–titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanocomposites (MCTs), which have two types of TiO2 phases (anatase and TiO2(B)), were synthesized by sol–gel method. Structural characterization of the MCT samples was performed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations, N2 adsorption– desorption isotherm measurements at 77 K, and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Lithium storage properties of the MCT samples were evaluated by galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements. The obtained electrochemical data indicated that TiO2(B) nanocrystals in MCTs play a crucial role in exhibiting their superior electrode properties. In order to discuss the detailed lithium storage mechanism of the TiO2(B) phase in MCT electrodes, in situ synchrotron XRD investigation during a galvanostatic charge–discharge test was performed using a single-phase TiO2(B) electrode. It was shown by this experiment that a unique lithium storage behavior enabled stable and high rate of lithium storage."
1110, Compatibilization of Linear Low-Density Polyethylene and Polydimethyl Siloxane Rubber Through Reactive Blending,2012-03-01,"Linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) was reactive blended with polydimethyl siloxane rubber (PDMS) in presence of a compatibilizer at a composition of 50:50 and characterized. Ethylene-methylacrylate (EMA) reacts with PDMS rubber forming EMA-g-PDMS in-situ, during melt blending at 200 °C at rotor speed of 100 rpm in a Haake Rheomix. The compatibilizer level was optimized from evaluation of physico-mechanical, dynamic mechanical, electrical, rheological and morphological studies. Optimum proportion of the chemical compatibilizer was found to be 12 wt%. At this proportion, the tensile strength, impact strength, adhesion strength, melt viscosity and electrical properties of the compatibilized blend increased and the domain size of the dispersed PDMS rubber phase decreased."
1111,Revealing Antiphase Boundaries and Defects at Atomic Resolution in NaLaMgWO Double Perovskites,2012-03-01,"Structural investigations on double perovskites NaLaMgWO6 using combined X-ray powder diffraction and transmission electron microscopy techniques have verified the obtained structure with a space group of C2/m (No. 12), which is different from the original report of the monoclinic one. In addition, high-angle annular-dark-field electron micrographs of the NaLaMgWO6 double perovskite revealed the formation of antiphase boundaries, orientation domains and phase separation in Na0.7La1.1MgWO6 and NaLaMg1.3W0.9O6 by altering the compound chemistry. These results provide a direct structural insight to link the physical properties with their crystallographic defects for double perovskites on both scientific and engineering basis."
1112,Probing Spin–Spin and Spin-Lattice Relaxation Through Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Study of Nanoscale WOSystem,2012-03-01,"We show that nanoscale tungsten oxides, which are rich in oxygen deficiencies, could exhibit enhanced spin–spin relaxation over spin-lattice relaxation at low temperature. The morphological features were viewed through high resolution transmission electron microscopy. Whereas, participation of electron spin states originated from paramagnetic centers was revealed through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra at low (∼150 K) and high temperature (∼298 K). Compared to bigger sized WO3 particles (prepared at pH = 2), the smaller ones (prepared at pH = 5.5) were supposed to hold relatively large spin concentration owing to proportionately higher concentration of paramagnetic centers/ionized oxygen vacancies. For a given nanosystem, the dominance of spin–spin interaction over spin-lattice interaction was also ascertained at low temperature."
1113,"Structural, Morphological, Optical and Photoluminescence Properties of Ag-Doped Zinc Oxide Thin Films",2012-03-01,"Thin films of pure and Ag-doped ZnO are prepared by spray pyrolysis at optimized substrate temperature of 400 °C onto glass substrates. Influence of Ag-doping on structural, morphological, optical and photoluminescence properties of Ag-doped ZnO thin films is studied. Deposited films are polycrystalline with a hexagonal (wurtzite) crystal structure having (002) preferred orientation. SEM images show deposited thin films are smooth, compact and homogeneous having hydrophobic nature. All films exhibit a transmittance of about 85% in the visible region and a sharp absorption onset about 375 nm corresponding to the fundamental absorption edge 3.3 eV."
1114,Laser Fluence on Materials Obtained Under the Periodic Boundary Conditions,2012-03-01,"We present energy increase in condensed matters upon irradiation with short pulse laser shot determined by the first-principles simulation based on the time-dependent density functional theory. The laser-field is expressed by time-varying scalar potential with sawtooth type spatial variation within the periodic boundary conditions. With this scheme, the transferred energy by the laser-field (electric field) is defined as total-energy increase at the time when the laser-field vanishes. Then the amount of increase is found to be dependent not only on field intensity but also on vacuum thickness of the repeating slab model. The thickness dependence can be attributed with wider range of the scalar potential that expresses the laser-field with deeper vacuum thickness. The wider potential range increases amplitude of electroncloud oscillation induced by the pulse laser causing higher energy increase in materials. To obtain converged quantity in laser fluence, we conclude a large vacuum region is necessary."
1115,Soy Protein-Assisted Dispersion of Carbon Nanotubes in a Polymer Matrix,2012-03-01,"Facile methods for carbon nanotube (CNT) treatment are highly desired for improving dispersion of CNTs in polymer matrices, in particular, an environmentally benign treatment approach. In this study, soy protein isolate (SPI), an abundant renewable soy product, was used to treat CNTs. The significant improvement in dispersion of CNTs in poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) matrix was not only indicated by different types of microscopy, but also our newly developed quantitative evaluation approach provided agglomerate size distribution evidence showing the dramatically reduced agglomerates. Additionally, the different size of CNT agglomerates resulted in dramatic differences in conductivity and dielectric constants of the nanocomposites."
1116,Impact Factor: Should This Be a Criterion to Decide Which Journal to Publish in?,2012-03-01,No Abstract
1117,Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles with the Size Controlled by the Pores of Carbide-Derived Carbon,2011-12-01,"Gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) with a narrow size distribution and average sizes ranging from a few Ångströms to several nanometers were selectively adsorbed on porous carbide-derived carbons (CDCs). CDC powders were synthesized by chlorinating several carbide precursors (TiC, Mo2C, B4C, and SiC) at different temperatures (800 C for TiC-CDC, 1100 C for B4C-CDC, 600 and 1200 °C for Mo2C-CDC, and 1000 °C for SiC-CDC). The size and distribution of the Au-NPs largely reflects the pore size and pore size distribution of the CDC. Catalytic activity of carbon-supported gold was a size-dependent parameter and the highest CO oxidation was identified for the smallest particles. Since the pore size of CDC can be varied from about sub-nanometer to several nanometers with a narrow distribution and the surface chemistry of CDC can be easily modified, the proposed method can be used for selective trapping of a variety of metal and nonmetal nanoparticles for catalytic and other applications."
1118,Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Growth in High Vacuum Using Pt Catalyst in Alcohol Gas Source Method,2011-12-01,"Growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) was carried out on SiO2/Si substrates at 700 °C with Pt catalysts using an alcohol gas source method in a high vacuum. Scanning electron microscopy observations and Raman spectroscopy measurements showed the optimal ethanol pressure to be 1 × 10–4 Pa, which was much smaller than that used in the SWNT growth with a Co catalyst. Raman spectra measured with various excitation wavelengths showed that the G/Si ratios of the SWNTs grown with the Pt catalyst at 1 × 10–4 Pa was fairly larger than those grown with the Co catalyst at 1 × 10–1 Pa, indicating that the SWNT yield of the former was higher than that of the latter, in spite of the lower ethanol pressure. These results indicate that by using the Pt catalyst, the optimal ethanol pressure was considerably reduced, compared to the conventional Co catalyst. The usefulness of Pt catalyst for SWNT growth under low pressure was demonstrated for the first time."
1119,Enhanced X-Ray Shielding Effects of Carbon Nanotubes,2011-12-01,"We report an explicit phenomenon related to the X-ray attenuation inherent to carbon nanotubes (CNTs). We observed that the mass attenuation coefficient of CNTs was significantly higher than that observed for highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and fullerenes (C60) by 20–50%. The attenuation coefficient of CNTs increased by reducing the sample thickness. This attenuation phenomenon indicates the importance of the unique nanoscale morphology of CNTs, which cannot be interpreted by the already established X-ray absorption theory. In order to demonstrate the effect of CNTs, we coated a textile fabric with CNTs and found an enhanced X-ray attenuation of 70% (textile thickness of 25 mm). Therefore, CNT materials could now be used in the fabrication of light-weight and efficient X-ray safety equipment and devices."
1120,Direct Deposition of Aligned Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes by Fountain Pen Nanolithography,2011-12-01,"Fountain pen nanolithography was used to deposit controllably nanotube dispersions on a silicon substrate with high spatial precision. The deposited structures were analysed using atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and polarised Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectroscopy showed that the deposited nanotubes had a very high degree of alignment with around 90% of the nanotubes aligned at an angle less than 30 from the direction of writing."
1121,Air-Free Fabrication and Investigation of Effect of Air Exposure on Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors,2011-12-01,"An air-free system which enables experiments from carbon nanotube (CNT) growth to device characterization without an effect of ambient air was constructed. It was clarified by using the system that an origin of instability of n-type conduction of carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNTFETs) with Al contacts in air was not attributed to oxidation of the Al contacts, but attributed to adsorption of oxygen. The present system was shown to be useful for investigating the effect of air on intrinsic electrical properties of CNTFETs with Al contacts, investigating the effect of passivation, and fabricating CNT p–n junction with Au(p)/Al(n) asymmetric electrodes."
1122,Biocompatible Fluorescent Jelly Quantum Dots for Bioimaging,2011-12-01,"CdTe/CdSe quantum dots (QDs) embedded gelatin nanoparticles were synthesized via aqueous method. The morphology of the nanoparticles was characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and the average size of QD/gelatin nanoparticles was 50 nm in size. The luminescent properties of these nanoparticles were studied by using fluorescence spectrophotometry and fluorescence microscopy. The nanoparticles was used for imaging cell lines such as GI-1, MCF 7, HUVEC, L929 and biocompatibility of nanoparticles was studied and found that the gelatin coated QDs are highly compatible even at higher concentrations of nanoparticles. Our results identify that biopolymer coated nanoparticles are expected to be ideal candidates for in vivo biological imaging studies."
1123,The Influence of Epoxy Functionalized Silica Nanoparticles on Stress Dispersion and Crack Resistance in Epoxy–Based Hybrids,2011-12-01,"The article presents synthesis, characterization, mechanical properties and fracture behavior of the epoxy polymers reinforced with either pristine or epoxy functionalized silica nanoparticles. The nanoscale silica is prepared and functionalized in situ via acidic hydrolysis and pre-organization of different alkoxysilane precursors into the epoxy monomers. It is demonstrated that epoxide functionalization of silica nanoparticles not only improves their distribution in the epoxy polymer, but simultaneously enhances the strength [>60%], Young's modulus [>85%] and tensile toughness [> 56%] of the resulting hybrids, without adversely affecting their ductility [<7%], even at 15 phr silica loading. The atomic force micrographs of the 'stress fractured' hybrid surfaces reveal that stronger interfacial interactions lead to the effective dispersal of stress and offer efficient resistance to crack propagation. Furthermore, different types of fracture mechanisms are investigated and it is evidenced that crack deflection is the most likely mechanism contributing to the improved mechanical performance of these hybrid epoxy/silica polymers."
1124,Metal-Free Low-Cost Organic Dye-Sensitized ZnO-Nanorod Photoanode for Solid-State Solar Cell,2011-12-01,"The synthesis of ZnO nanorods (ZnONRs), by virtue of their anisotropic electronic properties, and their exploitation as photoanode material for low-cost metal-free organic dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) are reported. The ZnO nanostructures were prepared through sol–gel method and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV–vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. The photovoltaic performance of the eosin yellow (eosin-Y) sensitized solar cell employing TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) modified poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) based solid-state polymer electrolyte was evaluated under simulated standard global AM 1.5G sunlight (100 mW/cm2). The solar to electrical energy conversion efficiency (η) of the ZnONRs based DSSC was 0.89%, which is 2.5 times higher than that of the DSSC fabricated with ZnO nanoparticles (0.35%). This enhancement in the efficiency is attributed to an effective conduction of electrons through the 1D ZnO nanostructures."
1125,"Variation in Carbon Nanotube Polymer Composite Conductivity from the Effects of Processing, Dispersion, Aging and Sample Size",2011-12-01,"We investigated a number of parameters which can affect the apparent electrical conductivity of a polymer/carbon nanotube composite. Focusing on the stress input generated by a dispersion technique, the effect of shear-mixing and ultrasonication on the morphology of carbon nanotube is examined. Using these two processing techniques, we fabricated composite films of multi-wall carbon nanotubes isotropically dispersed in a crosslinked polydimethylsiloxane matrix. The resulting electrical properties were characterized by AC impedance and DC current–voltage characterization across the film thickness using a parallel-plate geometry, and by surface resistivity using a 4-probe technique, also including the aging effects. We observed a large variation in conductivity depending on the electrical probing distance or the sample size. The presence of localized, dense conductive networks with length scales comparable to the film thickness (or the sensing probe separation) is suggested to account for the observed variation."
1126,Enhancement in Thermal and Tensile Properties of ZrO/Poly(Vinyl Alcohol) Nanocomposite Film,2011-12-01,"We report the preparation of zirconium oxidepoly(vinyl alcohol) nanocomposite film by solvent casting method. Existence of ZrO2 nanoparticles in the film has been evidently proved by the results of XRD, FTIR and AFM studies. Mechanical tests show that, compared with pure PVA, the elongation at break (%), the tensile strength and Young's modulus of the nanocomposite film is greatly improved by about factors of 1.40, 1.79 and 1.69 respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis shows that the stability of the nanocomposite film is almost two fold increase than the pure PVA film. The enhancement in the thermal and mechanical properties of the nanocomposite film is mainly due to the homogeneous dispersion of ZrO2 in the polymer matrix and strong interfacial interactions between the both components."
1127,Fabrication and Characterization of Optic Fiber-Based Poly(3-hexylthiophene) Micro Concentrator Photovoltaic Cell,2011-12-01,"We studied the physical implications of an alternative architectural design for a photovoltaic cell and the optical parameters, which, when optimized, can maximize absorption in the organic semiconductor layer. By using an optical fiber to guide light into the semiconductor, we found two mechanisms for guiding the light into the active layer. The optical-fiber cell is designed in such a way that at specific optical input angles, the amount of resonant light absorbed into the organic semiconductor layer is maximized. We developed a mathematical model to determine the optimum incident angle, taking into account the incident plane, the meridional plane, the cross-sectional area of the fiber, and the optical path length."
1128,A Simulation of Possible Carbon Nanotubes Slitting in a CMOS Compatible Way,2011-12-01,"We report first-principles-based molecular dynamics simulations of the interaction between single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and water/SiO mixtures (""SiO steam"") and ""dry"" SiO gas at high temperatures. Our results show that bond-breaking of circumferential C–C bonds occurs due to the formation of –Si(C2)–O– chains on the outer surface of the SWCNT along the tube direction. This process may eventually ""unzip"" the SWCNT along its axis to form a bilayer stack of graphene nanoribbons (GNR). Since this process does not involve chemicals which have detrimental effects on Si based electronics, it offers a safe route towards incorporating GNR into traditional CMOS devices. As no new elements are introduced, existing CMOS production equipment can be adapted with reasonable effort to integrate our proposed process. The transformation of CNT into GNR can be performed after deposition of the SWCNT at the target location on the device, allowing better control and easier processing. We propose to use treatment of SWCNTs in SiO steam to unzip them into graphene nanoribbons for CMOS/GNR integrated electronic devices."
1129,"Stable Water Insoluble Radicals of 1,1'',1""'-tribenzyl[4,2'; 4',4'; 6',4''']quaterpyridinium Trichloride for Photochromic Films",2011-12-01,"The electron relay compound 1,1'',1""'-tribenzyl[4,2'; 4',4'; 6',4''']quaterpyridinium trichloride (R7B) can be chemically or electrochemically reduced to a blue species which is insoluble in water and stable against oxygen in contrast to that obtained by reduction of methyl viologen. The species has a radical electronic structure as confirmed by EPR. Electrochemical reduction of R7B on SnO2 coated glass leads to water insoluble films. The colour of these radicals is dependent on pH; they are colourless in acidic and blue in alkaline solutions, which is ascribed to the reversible formation of a protonated charge transfer radical complex. R7B shows strong fluorescence. Under UV illumination, the excited state of R7B is reductively quenched by electron donors leading to the blue radical. Immobilization of such a system on a solid substrate leads to remarkable persistence of the colour (keeping the photochemically reduced films of R7B in the dark gave no detectable changes after one year) which can be used for long time optical information storage."

1131,Application of Carbon Nanotubes for Removing Organic Contaminants from Water,2011-09-01,This review article focuses on the surface adsorptive properties of carbon nanotubes and their use in the removal of organic environmental contaminants from water. An introduction to the prevalent organic contaminants as well as some emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products in aquatic environment are briefly discussed. The growth and surface modification techniques of carbon nanotubes and their implication on the adsorption potential of CNTs are examined. Adsorption capacity and affinity of organic contaminants on carbon nanotubes and parameters affecting such adsorption process including the environmental chemistry such as competition from co-existing environmental contaminants are summarized. The recent use of molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the molecular mechanism and adsorption phenomenon near carbon nanotube surfaces are briefly reviewed. Some of our recent MD simulation investigations of adsorption mechanisms and interactions between organic contaminants and CNT surfaces are presented. New developments and potential directions on adsorption-based CNT applications in water purification are discussed.
1132,Stable Dispersions of Nitrogen Containing Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes,2011-09-01,"Stable dispersions of pure and nitrogen containing multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs and N-MWCNTs respectively) were prepared using a variety of solvents (such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), benzyl alcohol, acetophenone, N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), etc. with surface energies ranging between 45.8 mJ/m2 (diethyl ether) and 102.3 mJ/m2 (water). Sedimentation measurements were employed to confirm the stability of the dispersions over time. Amongst the solvents employed DMA proved to be particularly efficient, i.e., up to 82% of the nanotubes initially dispersed remained in solution. Moreover, we showed that the surface chemistry of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) governs their dispersibility. For instance, the higher the N content is within the N-MWCNTs, the lower the surface energy of the solvent must be to successfully disperse the nanotubes. These findings not only play an important role in overcoming current obstacles commonly encountered in existing CNT processing procedures but also provide a technique for processing CNTs efficiently without altering their properties. Ultimately, it may be possible to manipulate the surface chemistry of CNTs in-situ, e.g., by inserting heteroatoms, to such extend that they may disperse spontaneously in aqueous solutions, hence paving the way for biomedical applications etc."
1133,A Liquid-Precursor Synthesis of Single-Phase Magnetoelectric LaFeO Nanocrystallites,2011-09-01,"LaFeO3, a nontoxic and thermally stable compound, when prepared of small crystallites offers tailored magnetic and magnetoelectric properties at room temperature. In this article, we describe synthesis of a phase pure LaFeO3 of nanocrystallites with a bonded carbon surface layer from a liquid precursor at moderate temperature in air. The results demonstrate that, upon sonication and microwave heating, the metal ions La3+ and Fe3+ in an inorganic-organic precursor cluster and grow into LaFeO3 crystallites in a specific shape of nanoplates, typically 40–150 nm in width and 15–25 nm in thickness, at moderate temperature ∼700 °C in ambient air. The stable phase LaFeO3 stands in an orthorhombic crystal structure (Pnma space group), on sintering to obtain useful ferroelec- tric properties in a dense pellet. At room temperature, a sintered pellet (at 950 °C for 4 h) measures a wide ferroelectric hysteresis loop, showing a polarization of 2.05 μC/cm2, remnant polarization of 0.78 μC/cm2, and coercivity 7.65 kV/cm for an applied electric field up to 18 kV/cm (at 500 Hz). These values are compatible to those known in important granular multiferroics such as BiFeO3 and composites."

It involves the measurement of resistance of the sensor in a chamber containing the urine sample. The sensor is constructed with an active composite material made of 10 mg of multiwalled carbon nanotube mixed with 0.5% nafion solution in ethanol through a process of sonication and subsequent deposition between two gold electrodes. The resistance of the sensor increases in the presence of acetone that is linear in the concentration range of 5 micromolar to 25 millimolar concentration in two steps. For the practical diagnosis the sensor operates well in the concentration range of 30 mg/dL to 80 mg/dL that is specific to diabetes mellitus and ketosis. The presence of ethanol in urine will not interfere with the measurement. The response time of the sensor is about 200 seconds. The sensor can be reused after flushing with nitrogen gas. The mechanism of sensor operation has been examined by Fourier Infrared Spectroscopy which suggests that acetone adsorption and desorption is producing the sensor action.
1135,Computing C1 X-ray Absorption for Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes with Distinct Electronic Type,2011-09-01,"The experimental data recorded for the C1s edge in X-ray absorption spectroscopy for graphite, graphene and nanotubes, have consistently exhibited certain discrepancies when compared with theoretical calculations. A theoretical approach to estimate the energy scale normalization for the C1s shape in X-ray absorption is presented within the time dependent density functional theory and random phase approximation framework employing the loss function. The position of the σ* resonance is fairly localized whereas core hole effects must be envisaged in order to have an agreement with the delocalization of the π* resonance, which is displaced by ∼2 eV. Here we report a combined experimental and theoretical approach to identify the electronic conduction band of single walled carbon nanotubes using X-ray absorp- tion, taking into account their metallic character."
1136,Luminescence Properties and White Emission in Pr  Doped Hexagonal YAlO Nanophosphors,2011-09-01,"Pr3+ doped hexagonal YAlO3 nanophosphors were synthesized via a facile sol–gel combustion method. The phase, morphology and fluorescent spectra were recorded by XRD, TEM and PLE-PL measurements respectively. The relative position of the 1S0 state and the lowest 4f5d state of Pr3+ ions in hexagonal YAlO3 was proposed based on the fluorescent spectra, which account for the coexistence of the parity-allowed inter-configurational broadband 4f5d→4f2 (3F J , 3H J ) transitions and parity-forbidden intra-configurational narrowband 4f2→4f2 transitions: 3P0, 1→3F2, 3, 4, 3H4, 5, 6 and 1D2→3H4. It is noteworthy that the white light emission was obtained for Pr3+ doped hexagonal YAlO3nanophosphors. The white light consists of the blue 487 nm (3P0→3H4), green 565 nm (3P0→3H5) and red 610 nm (1D2→3H4) emissions. The calculated color coordinates indicate that white light output can be adjusted by the control of dopant concentration. The Pr3+ doped hexagonal YAlO3 can be of a candidate material for application in the field of white lighting, displays, tunable visible laser and etc."
1137,"Preparation and Characterization of Electrical, Optical and Magnetic Properties of Hydrogenated Multilayer ZnO/Co Thin Films",2011-09-01,"This paper reports preparation and characterization of hydrogenated ZnO/Co multilayer thin films. These multilayer thin films were deposited on glass substrates at room temperature using flash evaporation technique at a base pressure of 10–5 torr. These multilayer thin films were hydrogenated at different pressure (30, 45 and 60 psi) of hydrogen at 433 K for 30 minutes. The films were characterized to see the effect of hydrogen on structural, electrical, optical, magnetic and morphological properties. As a consequence of hydrogenation, an enhancement is observed in the electrical conductivity as well as the optical band gap of these films. Also, the surface roughness of the multilayer film is found to be increased after hydrogenation."
1138,Fabrication and Photocatalytic Effects of Tungsten Trioxide Nano-Pattern Arrays,2011-09-01,We first fabricated arrays of WO3 nanostructures by means of electrochemical deposition in predefined patterns generated by nanoimprint lithography. Dot and line patterns were tuned by controlling preparation conditions. Morphological and photocurrentvoltage characterization revealed strong correlations between pattern structures and photocatalytic effects. The technique for producing a nano-patterned photocatalyst described in this study may be applicable to self-cleaning window panes to maximize photocatalytic effects without significant transparency compensation.
1139,Graphene Patterning and Lithography Employing Laser/Electron-Beam Reduced Graphene Oxide and Hydrogenated Graphene,2011-09-01,"Having discovered that graphene oxide (GO) films get reduced to graphene when subjected to laser or electron beam irradiation, we have carried out graphene patterning and nanolithography starting with pure GO and GO mixture with gold and platinum salts. Patterning has also been carried out with hydrogenated graphene which upon laser irradiation reverts back to graphene giving out hydrogen."

1141,Progress in Superhydrophilic Surface Development,2011-06-01,"Superhydrophilic surfaces induce the complete spreading of a water droplet to near-zero contact angle. This extreme water-loving behavior makes such surfaces favorable for a broad range of research and commercial applications. Superhydrophilicity can be induced by surface structure, specifically by rough and porous microstructures. Surface reactions based on photo-induced mechanism enhance the superhydrophilic effect of surfaces with microstructures. In this review, the generation of porous and rough surfaces exhibiting superhydrophilicity using various techniques such as etching, layer-by-layer assembly, hydrothermal treatment, nanocomposite coatings and polymerization are summarized. Furthermore, techniques for creating superhydrophilic coatings comprising light-sensitive materials are described. We also discuss the fundamental challenges involved in generating robust superhydrophilic surfaces."
1142,Silicon Nanowire Growth and Properties: A Review,2011-06-01,"Over the last few years silicon nanowires have come under intensive research due to their promising physical properties and potential as active materials in future electronic and optoelectronic applications. This article reviews various bottom-up growth methods of silicon nanowires. Various catalysts, including gold and other metals, as well as non-catalyst initiated growth methods are discussed in detail by comparing recipes including important parameters such as growth temperature, catalyst deposition methods, silicon nanowires diameter obtained, surface quality etc. This is expected to allow for an easier selection of a suitable growth method for a desired application.

1143,"Doping (10, 0)-Semiconductor Nanotubes with Nitrogen and Vacancy Defects",2011-06-01,"The electronic properties of (10, 0)-semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) containing structural defects such as vacancies (single and di-vacancies), and pyridinic Nitrogen atoms, are investigated using first-principles density functional theory. The band structure, electronic band gap, formation energy, structural relaxation, and HOMOLUMO wave functions, were systematically calculated using various combinations of vacancies and nitrogen concentrations. It is found that depending on the concentration and location of Nitrogen atoms with respect to the vacancy-sites, semiconducting (10, 0)-SWCNTs could become metallic. After relaxation, di-vacancies, with pyridine-like Nitrogen atoms, undergo a reconstruction so as to form pentagonal and octagonal rings in which Nitrogen behaves as a substitutional atom (not pyridinic) within the graphitic lattice. Interestingly, some Nitrogen doped configurations exhibit a p-type doping characteristics. The possibility of having p–n junctions in SWCNTs by doping with just one element as dopant is also discussed."
1144,"Multifunctional Mesoporous Silica-Coated Hollow Manganese Oxide Nanoparticles for Targeted Optical Imaging,  Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Photodynamic Therapy",2011-06-01,"We report the development of multi-functional uniform nanoparticles comprising a hollow manganese oxide core and a functionalized mesoporous silica shell (H–[email protected]2 (Ir)@–FA, Ir: an emissive iridium complex, FA: folic acid) for use as theranostic nanocomposites that combine four-in-one functionality, i.e., dual imaging (both magnetic resonance and optical), specific targeting and therapy in a single unit. The H–[email protected]2 (Ir)–FA nanoparticles (NPs) demonstrate its versatility in various applications. (1) The magnetic core provides the capability for T 1magnetic resonance imaging. (2) Phosphorescent iridium complex serves as both photosensitizer and the luminescent chromophore. (3) The nano-channels in the mesoporous silica shell increase the free diffusion of oxygen and water permeability, enhancing photodynamic therapy (PDT) and T 1 signal, respectively. (4) Folic acid anchored on the outermost surface is able to target at specific cells for bimodal imaging and PDT.

1145,Competitive Bonding of Amino and Hydroxyl Groups in Ethanolamine on Si(100)2×1: Temperature-Dependent X-Ray Photoemission and Thermal Desorption Studies of Nanochemistry of a Double-Chelating Agent,2011-06-01,"Temperature-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS) have been used to study the room-temperature adsorption and thermal evolution of ethanolamine. Like allylamine, the presence of a broad N 1s feature at 399.1 eV commonly attributed to N–Si indicates N–H dissociative adsorption of ethanolamine, while the O 1s feature at 533.1 eV indicates the formation of Si–O bond and O–H dissociation as found in allyl alcohol. Furthermore, a broad C 1s envelope, corresponding to the C–N feature at 284.9 eV and C–O feature at 285.7 eV, is observed. These XPS data are consistent with the [N, O] bidentate staggered and eclipsed ethanolamine conformer adspecies resulting from N–H dissociation and O–H dissociation, as predicted by our Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The adspecies remains stable upon annealing to 595 K, above which C–N and C–O dissociation occurs, as reflected by the conversion of existing XPS features to a new N 1s feature at 397.7 eV corresponding to Si–N(H)–Si and a new O 1s feature at 532.0 eV corresponding to Si–O–Si, with no loss in the respective total intensities up to 1190 K and 1090 K, respectively. The spectral evolution of the N 1s and O 1s features is also consistent with the emergence of a new C 1s envelop near 285.3 eV, corresponding to the dissociated →C–C← (ethanyl) adspecies, at 595 K. The minor loss (30%) in the total C 1s intensity and the emergence of TDS features of m/z 26, 27, and 28 near 615 K further support that some of the ethanyl adspecies has desorbed as ethylene. The majority of the ethanyl adspecies is found to remain on the surface and is converted at 890 K to SiC, with representative C 1s feature at 283.2 eV. The observed thermal evolution suggests the possibility of thermally controlling the conversion of a double NH and O passivated Si(100) surface at 595 K to a N passivated Si(100) surface at 1190 K. Unlike the multidentate allyl alcohol and allylamine adspecies that are found to be not favoured kinetically, the formation of the present [N, O] bidentate ethanolamine adspecies appears to be kinetically favoured on Si(100)2×1."
1146,A Multifunctional Gold Nanoparticle/Polyelectrolyte Fibrous Nanocomposite Prepared from Electrospinning Process,2011-06-01,"Gold nanoparticles are introduced to a fibrous nanocomposite material prepared from electrospinning a polyelectrolyte solution of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH). The functional groups in the fiber allow convenient thermal crosslinking of the fibers and the binding of tetrachloroaurate ions. Gold nanoparticle-modified nanofibers can be further treated by silver enhancement that increased the electrical conductivity of the nanofibers to 10–2 S/cm. The FT-IR analysis of the nanocomposite fibers shows that the deposition of gold nanoparticles significantly enhances the IR absorption intensity of the polymer fibers, offering a potential sensing capability through enhanced FT-IR absorption of molecules. Upon laser irradiation, the photothemal effect generated by gold nanoparticles caused deformation, melting, or local decomposition of the nanofibers which allows the patterning of nanofibers. The multifunctional composite nanofibers may find many important potential applications in sensors, optical and electronic devices, tissue engineering and catalysis."
1147,Understanding the Role of Sulfur in Tuning the Diameter and Morphology in the Chemical Vapor Deposition Growth of Carbon Nanotubes,2011-06-01,"A floating catalyst thermal CVD process using ferrocene and sulfur delivered in varying weight ratios of iron to sulfur (3/1, 5/1 and 10/1) was used to prepare carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy indicated the segregation of sulfur to the surface of the iron nanoparticles and the formation of an iron/sulfur boundary, which promoted the nanotube growth. The average catalyst particle size was observed to decrease with decreasing sulfur content (10/1), which reflected in a reduction in the number of walls (from multiple to single) of the CNTs produced. The growth process described here represents a facile and scalable method to tune the diameter and wall-structure of CNTs by changing the concentration of sulfur with respect to iron."
1148,Synergetic Promotional Effects Between Cerium Oxides and Manganese Oxides for NH-Selective Catalyst Reduction Over Ce–Mn/TiO,2011-06-01,"Ce and Mn codoped Ce–Mn/TiO2 catalysts were synthesized by sol–gel method and were used as model catalysts to investigate the synergetic promotional effects between cerium oxides and manganese oxides for selective catalytic reduction of NO by NH3 . The catalysts were characterized by SEM, XRD, XPS, and temperature-programmed hydrogen reduction (H2-TPR) and ammonia desorption (NH3-TPD) techniques. The experimental results showed that cerium oxides and manganese oxides affected each other, and their catalystic activities improved both at low and high temperatures. The catalysts yielded more than 90% NO X  conversion in the temperature range 250–450 C and W/F of 0.00125 g min mL–1 (W/F represents the ratio of the catalyst weight to the gas flow rate). It was suggested that the mobility of oxygen species enhanced through the sandwiched structure []-Mn–O–Ce ([] represents the oxygen vacancy), leading to the enhancement of the NO X  conversion over Ce–Mn/TiO2 significantly. Moreover, the Ce and Mn codoping improved the acid concentration with both medium acid sites and strong acid sites. Ce doping inhibited the growth of crystal size of TiO2, while Mn doping had little influence on it."
1149,Evolutional Transformation of Copper Oxide Nanowires to Copper Nanowires by a Reduction Technique,2011-06-01,"We report here a simple method to produce copper nanowires on a substrate as an alternative to template approaches and chemical synthesis routes. First, copper oxide nanowires are grown from conventional bulk copper wires by thermal oxidation. The resulting nanowires, which are a mixture of CuO and Cu2O, are normal to the substrate. Next, these oxide nanowires are reduced to copper nanowires in the same furnace under a hydrogen flow at 400 °C. The evolution of oxide nanowires and their transformation to copper nanowires is studied as a function of time. Electrical characterization reveals a reduction of resistance by six orders of magnitude at the completion of the reduction process."

1152,Two-Dimensional Crystals: Beyond Graphene,2011-03-01,"Human progress and development has always been marked by breakthroughs in the control of materials. Since pre-historic times, through the stone, bronze, and iron ages, humans have exploited their environment for materials that can be either used directly or can be modified for their benefit, to make their life more comfortable, productive, or to give them military advantage. One age replaces another when the material that is the basis for its sustainability runs its course and is replaced by another material which presents more qualities. Multi-tasking, speed, versatility, and flexibility are at the heart of modern technology. In recent years a new class of materials that can fulfill these needs have emerged: two-dimensional (2D) crystals. Graphene is probably the most famous example, but there are numerous other examples with amazing electronic and structural properties. In this paper we look into the possible routes for exploration of this new field that presents new venues in basic science as well as in applications."
1153,"Polymer-Derived Non-Oxide Ceramic Fibers—Past, Present and Future",2011-03-01,"Polymer-derived ceramics (PDCs) are a class of multifunctional ceramics synthesized by the thermal decomposition of polymeric precursors. The direct polymer-to-ceramic processing route makes the materials very suitable for the fabrication of complex shaped components and devices through hybrid processing/shaping technologies. Such process has led to significant technology breakthrough in ceramics including the development of ceramic fibers, coatings and thermal stable ceramics. Non-oxide ceramic fibers have been widely used as the skeletal structures in ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) for high temperature applications where the metallic materials suffer serious corrosion and mechanical property deterioration. Fabricating non-oxide ceramic fibers from polymer precursors offers excellent control of the mechanical and chemical properties of the ceramic fibers by manipulating the composition and physical properties of the polymer precursors. A series of high performance ceramic fibers with diameter from nanometers to micrometers have been produced through such polymer-derived ceramic fiber process. Well-designed synthesis of the precursors, materials processing and characterization play the key role in producing ceramic fibers with desired properties. The incorporation of functional materials including carbon nanotubes and polymers into the preceramic polymers can introduce difference functionalities and generate interesting nanosize structures to the ceramic fibers, providing new applications such as catalyzing and energy storage devices. This review highlights the synthesis of polymer precursors and the development of non-oxide ceramic fibers from different polymer precursors through melt-spinning and electrospinning, presents recent progress in fabricating ceramic fibers with nanosize structures, and discusses the advantage, challenge and future direction of the research in this field."
1154,A Resonant Photoemission Insight to the Electronic Structure of Gd Nanowires Templated in the Hollow Core of SWCNTs,2011-03-01,"Single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are archetypical 1D systems with peculiar electronic properties which can be modified in a controlled manner by various methods. One of these is filling the hollow core with metallofullerenes. Additionally, subsequent modifications can be induced utilizing the nanotube hollow space as a nano-reactor. Here we show the electronic structure changes of [email protected]82 peapods upon transformation into Gd nanowires encapsulated in SWCNTs. This has been monitored by a combined high resolution photoemission and X-ray absorption study. From a detailed analysis of the Gd 3d, 4d, 4f and C1s responses, as well as the valence band resonant photoemission, we were able to elucidate the changes in the bonding environment and charge transfer in these 1D systems. We observe a clear modification of the low energy electronic properties of the SWCNT transformed partly into dou- ble walled tubular structures with encapsulated Gd nanowires."
1155,Fusing Treatment of Pentacenes: Toward Giant Graphene-Like Molecule,2011-03-01,"To synthesize large-size polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that will be treated as model graphene material, we tried to fuse pentacenes at high temperatures under vacuum. Using mass spectroscopy and elemental analysis, we found that the sample recovered from the fusing reaction included a considerable number of dimers of pentacenes, the main component of which was peripentacene. We investigated the dimer phase by spectroscopic measurements such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman scattering and infrared absorption (FT-IR). In addition, we compared the observed electronic spectroscopic data of the dimer phase and the partial electron density of states of peripentacene derived from the first principle calculations. The observed spectra were well reproduced by the calculations."
1156,Direct Imaging of Lithium Ions Using Aberration-Corrected Annular-Bright-Field Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy and Associated Contrast Mechanisms,2011-03-01,"The vast potential and fast development of implementing lithium-based batteries as an alternative power source to replace the existing low-efficiency and environmental-hazardous materials have urged an ever expediting pace for investigation of the corresponding characterization methods, in particular to observe lithium ions at atomic scale. Here we demonstrate a feasible annular-bright-field (ABF) imaging method based on aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy to observe lithium ions directly at atomic resolution using LiFePO4, a positive electrode material routinely used, for a case study. In addition, we performed extensive image simulations, including the influences from specimen thickness, high tension, illumination angle, collection angle, material vacancy and lattice distortion, to compare and interpret explicitly the displayed image contrast and the attainable optimum operation conditions."
1157,Physically and Chemically Confined Nano-Patterns of Proteins and Bacteriophages,2011-03-01,"In this study, we present a robust method of fabricating physically and chemically confined nanopatterns of proteins and bacteriophages through a strategic coupling of a top-down based polymeric nano-molding and a bottom-up based biochemical self-assembly. An amphiphilic comb polymer was physically nano-patterned by capillary force lithography using a nanostructured mold material, generating nanopatterns could act as non-biofouling physical barriers. Proteins were then chemically bound onto the patterned surface flanked by the barrier of nanopatterns over a large-scale area. The high fidelity of nanopatterns was confirmed by the exquisite molecular binding, in which pattern-matching assembly of filamentous M13 bacteriophages was cognitive of the patterned protein molecules. The bacteriophage-assembled nanopatterns revealed that highly anisotropic M13 bacteriophages were selectively captured only on one-dimensional line patterns of proteins where the morphological characteristics of the bacteriophage could be relevantly accommodated. However, no bacteriophage binding was observed on the dot patterned array due to a mismatch in shape dimension. Therefore, it is anticipated that the strategy and ability to regulate the biological recognition by varying the shape or size of nanopatterns can be utilized to develop a screening means for the specific biomolecules or drugs."
1158,Morphology-Controlled ZnO Nanomaterials for Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Performance,2011-03-01,"We report and compare the photoelectrochemical properties of ZnO nanowalls and nanowires electrochemically deposited on an indium-tin-oxide coated glass substrate in an aqueous zinc nitrate electrolyte at 70 °C with and without post-annealing at 400 °C. Post-annealing at 400 °C produced a drastic change in the morphology of ZnO nanowalls but not in that of ZnO nanowires. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies provide detailed characterization of the respective changes in crystallinity and composition profile of the as-deposited nanostructures before and after post-annealing. Furthermore, the optical band gap is found to be smaller for the post-annealed nanowalls and nanowires. The Mott-Schottky measurements show a negative shift in the flat-band potential for the post-annealed samples. Upon 100 mW/cm² (AM 1.5) light illumination, the photocurrent density for the as-deposited (post-annealed) nanowalls and nanowires were measured to be 0.54 mA/cm² (1.56 mA/cm²) and 0.12 mA/cm² (1.03 mA/cm²), respectively, at an applied potential of 0.5 V versus Ag/AgCl. The significant improvement in the photoelectrochemical properties from the post-annealed ZnO nanostructures is believed to be due to increases in crystallinity and oxygen vacancy defects, and to reduction in the band gap with the corresponding increase in light absorption at higher wavelength. This study suggests that further improvement lies in synthesizing mesoporous and/or hydrid ZnO nanostructures with semiconductor materials with a smaller band gap."
1159,Nanostair Formation and Field Emission Enhancement on High Dose N-Ion-Implanted Ultrananocrystalline Diamond Pyramid Tips,2011-03-01,"We herein report high dose nitrogen (N) ion implantation induced nanostructural modifications and enhanced electron field emission (EFE) properties of ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) pyramid tips. Transmission electron microscopy investigations indicate nanostair type surface formation on the pyramid tips. Evidence of complex nanostructural changes due to ion implantation are found, such as, graphitic or amorphous type transition, volume expansion (about 0.56 μm³), and nanostair type surface formation. The nanostructural modifications possibly enhanced the grain boundary incorporation of N and the electron transport through a transfer doping mechanism, which in turn improved the EFE properties of the ion-implanted pyramid tips. In particular upon N ion implantation the turn-on field is found to reduce from 3.6 V/μm (for unimplanted tips) to 2.8 V/μm and the current density is increased from 0.1 mA/cm² (unimplanted tips) to 5.4 mA/cm² at an applied field of 12.5 V/μm."
1160,Toxicity of Silver Nanoparticles as Assessed by Global Gene Expression Analysis,2011-03-01,"Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) showed a toxic effect on HeLa cells. For cells exposed to Ag-NPs at a concentration of 20μg/ml for 24 h and 48 h, the number of viable cells decreased by 45.4 ± 7.3% and 47.3 ± 8.8%, respectively. Cells exposed to Ag-NPs for 24 h up- and down-regulated 2065 and 1286 genes, respectively. In a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, the genes up-regulated by Ag-NPs were classified into functional categories that included various primary metabolic processes, cellular processes, and stress responses. Most of these functional changes, as represented by up-regulated gene expression, could be attributed to Ag ions released from Ag-NPs. In addition, functional categories identified by the categorization of up-regulated genes suggest that the reduction in the viable cell number after exposure to Ag-NPs could be attributed to apoptosis but not cell cycle arrest. Most genes down-regulated by Ag-NPs could also be attributed to exposure to released Ag ions, but most of the functional changes caused by genes down-regulated by Ag-NPs could be attributed to Ag-NPs themselves but not to released Ag ions. For cells exposed to Ag-NPs for 48 h, the number of genes with altered expression was significantly decreased relative to that of cells exposed for 24 h, suggesting that cells may be able to cope with the toxicity of Ag-NPs within 48 h."
1161,Fabrication of Aligned Carbon Nanotube Array Electrodes for Organic Electronic Devices,2011-03-01,"We report fabrication of aligned array carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes for organic electronic device applications. The ultra-high density aligned CNT array was assembled via dielectrophoresis (DEP) from a high quality surfactant free and stable aqueous CNT solution. The CNT source and drain electrodes were formed though oxidative cutting of aligned CNT array by electron beam lithography and precise oxygen plasma etching. As an example of usefulness of this electrode, organic field effect transistor was fabricated using a thin film of poly (3-hexylthiophene) and the electrical transport properties of the devices were studied. Compared to the control devices fabricated with gold electrode, devices based on CNT array electrode show better performance with higher mobility, higher current on/off ratio and higher reproducibility. This study demonstrates that aligned array CNT electrode will have potential applications in fabricating organic electronic devices."
