0,Room-temperature epitaxial welding of 3D and 2D perovskites,2022-07-25,"Formation of epitaxial heterostructures via post-growth self-assembly is important in the design and preparation of functional hybrid systems combining unique properties of the constituents. This is particularly attractive for the construction of metal halide perovskite heterostructures, since their conventional solution synthesis usually leads to non-uniformity in composition, crystal phase and dimensionality. Herein, we demonstrate that a series of two-dimensional and three-dimensional perovskites of different composition and crystal phase can form epitaxial heterostructures through a ligand-assisted welding process at room temperature. Using the CsPbBr3/PEA2PbBr4 heterostructure as a demonstration, in addition to the effective charge and energy transfer across the epitaxial interface, localized lattice strain was observed at the interface, which was extended to the top layer of the two-dimensional perovskite, leading to multiple new sub-bandgap emissions at low temperature. Given the versatility of our strategy, unlimited hybrid systems are anticipated, yielding composition-, interface- and/or orientation-dependent properties."
1,Conduction band structure of high-mobility organic semiconductors and partially dressed polaron formation,2022-07-18,"The energy band structure provides crucial information on charge transport behaviour in organic semiconductors, such as effective mass, transfer integrals and electron–phonon coupling. Despite the discovery of the valence (the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)) band structure in the 1990s, the conduction band (the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)) has not been experimentally observed. Here we employ angle-resolved low-energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy to reveal the LUMO band structure of pentacene, a prototypical high-mobility organic semiconductor. The derived transfer integrals and bandwidths from the LUMO are substantially smaller than those predicted by density functional theory calculations. To reproduce this bandwidth reduction, we propose an improved (partially dressed) polaron model that accounts for the electron–intramolecular vibrational interaction with frequency-dependent coupling constants based on Debye relaxation. This model quantitatively reproduces not only the transfer integrals, but also the temperature-dependent HOMO and LUMO bandwidths, and the hole and electron mobilities. The present results demonstrate that electron mobility in high-mobility organic semiconductors is indeed limited by polaron formation."
2,Room-temperature logic-in-memory operations in single-metallofullerene devices,2022-07-14,"In-memory computing provides an opportunity to meet the growing demands of large data-driven applications such as machine learning, by colocating logic operations and data storage. Despite being regarded as the ultimate solution for high-density integration and low-power manipulation, the use of spin or electric dipole at the single-molecule level to realize in-memory logic functions has yet to be realized at room temperature, due to their random orientation. Here, we demonstrate logic-in-memory operations, based on single electric dipole flipping in a two-terminal single-metallofullerene (Sc2C2@Cs(hept)-C88) device at room temperature. By applying a low voltage of ±0.8 V to the single-metallofullerene junction, we found that the digital information recorded among the different dipole states could be reversibly encoded in situ and stored. As a consequence, 14 types of Boolean logic operation were shown from a single-metallofullerene device. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the non-volatile memory behaviour comes from dipole reorientation of the [Sc2C2] group in the fullerene cage. This proof-of-concept represents a major step towards room-temperature electrically manipulated, low-power, two-terminal in-memory logic devices and a direction for in-memory computing using nanoelectronic devices."
3,Tuning colour centres at a twisted hexagonal boron nitride interface,2022-07-14,"The colour centre platform holds promise for quantum technologies, and hexagonal boron nitride has attracted attention due to the high brightness and stability, optically addressable spin states and wide wavelength coverage discovered in its emitters. However, its application is hindered by the typically random defect distribution and complex mesoscopic environment. Here, employing cathodoluminescence, we demonstrate on-demand activation and control of colour centre emission at the twisted interface of two hexagonal boron nitride flakes. Further, we show that colour centre emission brightness can be enhanced by two orders of magnitude by tuning the twist angle. Additionally, by applying an external voltage, nearly 100% brightness modulation is achieved. Our ab initio GW and GW plus Bethe–Salpeter equation calculations suggest that the emission is correlated to nitrogen vacancies and that a twist-induced moiré potential facilitates electron–hole recombination. This mechanism is further exploited to draw nanoscale colour centre patterns using electron beams."
4,Mechanical checkpoint regulates monocyte differentiation in fibrotic niches,2022-07-11,"Myelofibrosis is a progressive bone marrow malignancy associated with monocytosis, and is believed to promote the pathological remodelling of the extracellular matrix. Here we show that the mechanical properties of myelofibrosis, namely the liquid-to-solid properties (viscoelasticity) of the bone marrow, contribute to aberrant differentiation of monocytes. Human monocytes cultured in stiff, elastic hydrogels show proinflammatory polarization and differentiation towards dendritic cells, as opposed to those cultured in a viscoelastic matrix. This mechanically induced cell differentiation is blocked by inhibiting a myeloid-specific isoform of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, PI3K-γ. We further show that murine bone marrow with myelofibrosis has a significantly increased stiffness and unveil a positive correlation between myelofibrosis grading and viscoelasticity. Treatment with a PI3K-γ inhibitor in vivo reduced frequencies of monocyte and dendritic cell populations in murine bone marrow with myelofibrosis. Moreover, transcriptional changes driven by viscoelasticity are consistent with transcriptional profiles of myeloid cells in other human fibrotic diseases. These results demonstrate that a fibrotic bone marrow niche can physically promote a proinflammatory microenvironment."
5,Directed cell migration towards softer environments,2022-07-11,"How cells sense tissue stiffness to guide cell migration is a fundamental question in development, fibrosis and cancer. Although durotaxis—cell migration towards increasing substrate stiffness—is well established, it remains unknown whether individual cells can migrate towards softer environments. Here, using microfabricated stiffness gradients, we describe the directed migration of U-251MG glioma cells towards less stiff regions. This ‘negative durotaxis’ does not coincide with changes in canonical mechanosensitive signalling or actomyosin contractility. Instead, as predicted by the motor–clutch-based model, migration occurs towards areas of ‘optimal stiffness’, where cells can generate maximal traction. In agreement with this model, negative durotaxis is selectively disrupted and even reversed by the partial inhibition of actomyosin contractility. Conversely, positive durotaxis can be switched to negative by lowering the optimal stiffness by the downregulation of talin—a key clutch component. Our results identify the molecular mechanism driving context-dependent positive or negative durotaxis, determined by a cell’s contractile and adhesive machinery."
6,Graphene oxide bulk material reinforced by heterophase platelets with multiscale interface crosslinking,2022-07-07,"Graphene oxide (GO) and reduced GO possess robust mechanical, electrical and chemical properties. Their nanocomposites have been extensively explored for applications in diverse fields. However, due to the high flexibility and weak interlayer interactions of GO nanosheets, the flexural mechanical properties of GO-based composites, especially in bulk materials, are largely constrained, which hinders their performance in practical applications. Here, inspired by the amorphous/crystalline feature of the heterophase within nacreous platelets, we present a centimetre-sized, GO-based bulk material consisting of building blocks of GO and amorphous/crystalline leaf-like MnO2 hexagon nanosheets adhered together with polymer-based crosslinkers. These building blocks are stacked and hot-pressed with further crosslinking between the layers to form a GO/MnO2-based layered (GML) bulk material. The resultant GML bulk material exhibits a flexural strength of 231.2 MPa. Moreover, the material exhibits sufficient fracture toughness and strong impact resistance while being light in weight. Experimental and numerical analyses indicate that the ordered heterophase structure and synergetic crosslinking interactions across multiscale interfaces lead to the superior mechanical properties of the material. These results are expected to provide insights into the design of structural materials and potential applications of high-performance GO-based bulk materials in aerospace, biomedicine and electronics."
7,Emergence of correlations in alternating twist quadrilayer graphene,2022-07-07,"Alternating twist multilayer graphene (ATMG) has recently emerged as a family of moiré systems that share several fundamental properties with twisted bilayer graphene, and are expected to host similarly strong electron–electron interactions near the magic angle. Here, we study alternating twist quadrilayer graphene (ATQG) samples with twist angles of 1.96° and 1.52°, which are slightly removed from the magic angle of 1.68°. At the larger angle, we find signatures of correlated insulators only when the ATQG is hole doped, and no signatures of superconductivity, and for the smaller angle we find evidence of superconductivity, while signs of the correlated insulators weaken. Our results provide insight into the twist angle dependence of correlated phases in ATMG and shed light on the nature of correlations in the intermediate coupling regime at the edge of the magic angle range where dispersion and interaction are of the same order."
8,Robust superconductivity in magic-angle multilayer graphene family,2022-07-07,"The discovery of correlated states and superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) established a new platform to explore interaction-driven and topological phenomena. However, despite multitudes of correlated phases observed in moiré systems, robust superconductivity appears the least common, found only in MATBG and more recently in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene. Here we report the experimental realization of superconducting magic-angle twisted four-layer and five-layer graphene, hence establishing alternating twist magic-angle multilayer graphene as a robust family of moiré superconductors. This finding suggests that the flat bands shared by the members play a central role in the superconductivity. Our measurements in parallel magnetic fields, in particular the investigation of Pauli limit violation and spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking, reveal a clear distinction between the N = 2 and N > 2-layer structures, consistent with the difference between their orbital responses to magnetic fields. Our results expand the emergent family of moiré superconductors, providing new insight with potential implications for design of new superconducting materials platforms."
9,Ultra-stable all-solid-state sodium metal batteries enabled by perfluoropolyether-based electrolytes,2022-07-04,"Rechargeable batteries paired with sodium metal anodes are considered to be one of the most promising high-energy and low-cost energy-storage systems. However, the use of highly reactive sodium metal and the formation of sodium dendrites during battery operation have caused safety concerns, especially when highly flammable liquid electrolytes are used. Here we design and develop solvent-free solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) based on a perfluoropolyether-terminated polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based block copolymer for safe and stable all-solid-state sodium metal batteries. Compared with traditional PEO SPEs, our results suggest that block copolymer design allows for the formation of self-assembled nanostructures leading to high storage modulus at elevated temperatures with the PEO domains providing transport channels even at high salt concentration (ethylene oxide/sodium = 8/2). Moreover, it is demonstrated that the incorporation of perfluoropolyether segments enhances the Na+ transference number of the electrolyte to 0.46 at 80 °C and enables a stable solid electrolyte interface. The new SPE exhibits highly stable symmetric cell-cycling performance at high current density (0.5 mA cm−2 and 1.0 mAh cm−2, up to 1,000 h). Finally, the assembled all-solid-state sodium metal batteries demonstrate outstanding capacity retention, long-term charge/discharge stability (Coulombic efficiency, 99.91%; >900 cycles with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode) and good capability with high loading NaFePO4 cathode (>1 mAh cm−2)."
10,Direct photo-oxidation of methane to methanol over a mono-iron hydroxyl site,2022-06-30,"Natural gas, consisting mainly of methane (CH4), has a relatively low energy density at ambient conditions (~36 kJ l−1). Partial oxidation of CH4 to methanol (CH3OH) lifts the energy density to ~17 MJ l−1 and drives the production of numerous chemicals. In nature, this is achieved by methane monooxygenase with di-iron sites, which is extremely challenging to mimic in artificial systems due to the high dissociation energy of the C–H bond in CH4 (439 kJ mol−1) and facile over-oxidation of CH3OH to CO and CO2. Here we report the direct photo-oxidation of CH4 over mono-iron hydroxyl sites immobilized within a metal–organic framework, PMOF-RuFe(OH). Under ambient and flow conditions in the presence of H2O and O2, CH4 is converted to CH3OH with 100% selectivity and a time yield of 8.81 ± 0.34 mmol gcat−1 h−1 (versus 5.05 mmol gcat−1 h−1 for methane monooxygenase). By using operando spectroscopic and modelling techniques, we find that confined mono-iron hydroxyl sites bind CH4 by forming an [Fe–OH···CH4] intermediate, thus lowering the barrier for C–H bond activation. The confinement of mono-iron hydroxyl sites in a porous matrix demonstrates a strategy for C–H bond activation in CH4 to drive the direct photosynthesis of CH3OH."
11,Subsecond multichannel magnetic control of select neural circuits in freely moving flies,2022-06-27,"Precisely timed activation of genetically targeted cells is a powerful tool for the study of neural circuits and control of cell-based therapies. Magnetic control of cell activity, or ‘magnetogenetics’, using magnetic nanoparticle heating of temperature-sensitive ion channels enables remote, non-invasive activation of neurons for deep-tissue applications and freely behaving animal studies. However, the in vivo response time of thermal magnetogenetics is currently tens of seconds, which prevents precise temporal modulation of neural activity. Moreover, magnetogenetics has yet to achieve in vivo multiplexed stimulation of different groups of neurons. Here we produce subsecond behavioural responses in Drosophila melanogaster by combining magnetic nanoparticles with a rate-sensitive thermoreceptor (TRPA1-A). Furthermore, by tuning magnetic nanoparticles to respond to different magnetic field strengths and frequencies, we achieve subsecond, multichannel stimulation. These results bring magnetogenetics closer to the temporal resolution and multiplexed stimulation possible with optogenetics while maintaining the minimal invasiveness and deep-tissue stimulation possible only by magnetic control."
12,Intrinsic ferroelectricity in Y-doped HfO,2022-06-27,"Ferroelectric HfO2-based materials hold great potential for the widespread integration of ferroelectricity into modern electronics due to their compatibility with existing Si technology. Earlier work indicated that a nanometre grain size was crucial for the stabilization of the ferroelectric phase. This constraint, associated with a high density of structural defects, obscures an insight into the intrinsic ferroelectricity of HfO2-based materials. Here we demonstrate that stable and enhanced polarization can be achieved in epitaxial HfO2 films with a high degree of structural order (crystallinity). An out-of-plane polarization value of 50 μC cm–2 has been observed at room temperature in Y-doped HfO2(111) epitaxial thin films, with an estimated full value of intrinsic polarization of 64 μC cm–2, which is in close agreement with density functional theory calculations. The crystal structure of films reveals the Pca21 orthorhombic phase with small rhombohedral distortion, underlining the role of the structural constraint in stabilizing the ferroelectric phase. Our results suggest that it could be possible to exploit the intrinsic ferroelectricity of HfO2-based materials, optimizing their performance in device applications."
13,Composition and phase engineering of metal chalcogenides and phosphorous chalcogenides,2022-06-23,"Two-dimensional (2D) materials with multiphase, multielement crystals such as transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) (based on V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cd, Pt and Pd) and transition metal phosphorous chalcogenides (TMPCs) offer a unique platform to explore novel physical phenomena. However, the synthesis of a single-phase/single-composition crystal of these 2D materials via chemical vapour deposition is still challenging. Here we unravel a competitive-chemical-reaction-based growth mechanism to manipulate the nucleation and growth rate. Based on the growth mechanism, 67 types of TMCs and TMPCs with a defined phase, controllable structure and tunable component can be realized. The ferromagnetism and superconductivity in FeXy can be tuned by the y value, such as superconductivity observed in FeX and ferromagnetism in FeS2 monolayers, demonstrating the high quality of as-grown 2D materials. This work paves the way for the multidisciplinary exploration of 2D TMPCs and TMCs with unique properties."
14,Capturing dynamic ligand-to-metal charge transfer with a long-lived cationic intermediate for anionic redox,2022-06-20,"Reversible anionic redox reactions represent a transformational change for creating advanced high-energy-density positive-electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries. The activation mechanism of these reactions is frequently linked to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) processes, which have not been fully validated experimentally due to the lack of suitable model materials. Here we show that the activation of anionic redox in cation-disordered rock-salt Li1.17Ti0.58Ni0.25O2 involves a long-lived intermediate Ni3+/4+ species, which can fully evolve to Ni2+ during relaxation. Combining electrochemical analysis and spectroscopic techniques, we quantitatively identified that the reduction of this Ni3+/4+ species goes through a dynamic LMCT process (Ni3+/4+–O2− → Ni2+–On−). Our findings provide experimental validation of previous theoretical hypotheses and help to rationalize several peculiarities associated with anionic redox, such as cationic–anionic redox inversion and voltage hysteresis. This work also provides additional guidance for designing high-capacity electrodes by screening appropriate cationic species for mediating LMCT."
15,Imaging gate-tunable Tomonaga–Luttinger liquids in 1H-MoSe,2022-06-16,"One-dimensional electron systems exhibit fundamentally different properties than higher-dimensional systems. For example, electron–electron interactions in one-dimensional electron systems have been predicted to induce Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid behaviour. Naturally occurring grain boundaries in single-layer transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit one-dimensional conducting channels that have been proposed to host Tomonaga–Luttinger liquids, but charge density wave physics has also been suggested to explain their behaviour. Clear identification of the electronic ground state of this system has been hampered by an inability to electrostatically gate such boundaries and tune their charge carrier concentration. Here we present a scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy study of gate-tunable mirror twin boundaries in single-layer 1H-MoSe2 devices. Gating enables scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy for different mirror twin boundary electron densities, thus allowing precise characterization of electron–electron interaction effects. Visualization of the resulting mirror twin boundary electronic structure allows unambiguous identification of collective density wave excitations having two velocities, in quantitative agreement with the spin–charge separation predicted by finite-length Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid theory."
16,Deterministic switching of a perpendicularly polarized magnet using unconventional spin–orbit torques in WTe,2022-06-16,"Spin–orbit torque (SOT)-driven deterministic control of the magnetic state of a ferromagnet with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is key to next-generation spintronic applications including non-volatile, ultrafast and energy-efficient data-storage devices. However, field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization remains a challenge because it requires an out-of-plane antidamping torque, which is not allowed in conventional spin-source materials such as heavy metals and topological insulators due to the system’s symmetry. The exploitation of low-crystal symmetries in emergent quantum materials offers a unique approach to achieve SOTs with unconventional forms. Here we report an experimental realization of field-free deterministic magnetic switching of a perpendicularly polarized van der Waals magnet employing an out-of-plane antidamping SOT generated in layered WTe2, a quantum material with a low-symmetry crystal structure. Our numerical simulations suggest that the out-of-plane antidamping torque in WTe2 is essential to explain the observed magnetization switching."
17,Unconventional excitonic states with phonon sidebands in layered silicon diphosphide,2022-06-16,"Complex correlated states emerging from many-body interactions between quasiparticles (electrons, excitons and phonons) are at the core of condensed matter physics and material science. In low-dimensional materials, quantum confinement affects the electronic, and subsequently, optical properties for these correlated states. Here, by combining photoluminescence, optical reflection measurements and ab initio theoretical calculations, we demonstrate an unconventional excitonic state and its bound phonon sideband in layered silicon diphosphide (SiP2), where the bound electron–hole pair is composed of electrons confined within one-dimensional phosphorus–phosphorus chains and holes extended in two-dimensional SiP2 layers. The excitonic state and emergent phonon sideband show linear dichroism and large energy redshifts with increasing temperature. Our ab initio many-body calculations confirm that the observed phonon sideband results from the correlated interaction between excitons and optical phonons. With these results, we propose layered SiP2 as a platform for the study of excitonic physics and many-particle effects."
18,Programmable gear-based mechanical metamaterials,2022-06-09,"Elastic properties of classical bulk materials can hardly be changed or adjusted in operando, while such tunable elasticity is highly desired for robots and smart machinery. Although possible in reconfigurable metamaterials, continuous tunability in existing designs is plagued by issues such as structural instability, weak robustness, plastic failure and slow response. Here we report a metamaterial design paradigm using gears with encoded stiffness gradients as the constituent elements and organizing gear clusters for versatile functionalities. The design enables continuously tunable elastic properties while preserving stability and robust manoeuvrability, even under a heavy load. Such gear-based metamaterials enable excellent properties such as continuous modulation of Young’s modulus by two orders of magnitude, shape morphing between ultrasoft and solid states, and fast response. This allows for metamaterial customization and brings fully programmable materials and adaptive robots within reach."
19,Halide perovskites enable polaritonic ,2022-06-09,"Exciton polaritons, the part-light and part-matter quasiparticles in semiconductor optical cavities, are promising for exploring Bose–Einstein condensation, non-equilibrium many-body physics and analogue simulation at elevated temperatures. However, a room-temperature polaritonic platform on par with the GaAs quantum wells grown by molecular beam epitaxy at low temperatures remains elusive. The operation of such a platform calls for long-lifetime, strongly interacting excitons in a stringent material system with large yet nanoscale-thin geometry and homogeneous properties. Here, we address this challenge by adopting a method based on the solution synthesis of excitonic halide perovskites grown under nanoconfinement. Such nanoconfinement growth facilitates the synthesis of smooth and homogeneous single-crystalline large crystals enabling the demonstration of XY Hamiltonian lattices with sizes up to 10 × 10. With this demonstration, we further establish perovskites as a promising platform for room temperature polaritonic physics and pave the way for the realization of robust mode-disorder-free polaritonic devices at room temperature."
20,High-entropy enhanced capacitive energy storage,2022-06-06,"Electrostatic dielectric capacitors are essential components in advanced electronic and electrical power systems due to their ultrafast charging/discharging speed and high power density. A major challenge, however, is how to improve their energy densities to effectuate the next-generation applications that demand miniaturization and integration. Here, we report a high-entropy stabilized Bi2Ti2O7-based dielectric film that exhibits an energy density as high as 182 J cm−3 with an efficiency of 78% at an electric field of 6.35 MV cm−1. Our results reveal that regulating the atomic configurational entropy introduces favourable and stable microstructural features, including lattice distorted nano-crystalline grains and a disordered amorphous-like phase, which enhances the breakdown strength and reduces the polarization switching hysteresis, thus synergistically contributing to the energy storage performance. This high-entropy approach is expected to be widely applicable for the development of high-performance dielectrics."
21,Tapered fibertrodes for optoelectrical neural interfacing in small brain volumes with reduced artefacts,2022-06-06,"Deciphering the neural patterns underlying brain functions is essential to understanding how neurons are organized into networks. This deciphering has been greatly facilitated by optogenetics and its combination with optoelectronic devices to control neural activity with millisecond temporal resolution and cell type specificity. However, targeting small brain volumes causes photoelectric artefacts, in particular when light emission and recording sites are close to each other. We take advantage of the photonic properties of tapered fibres to develop integrated ‘fibertrodes’ able to optically activate small brain volumes with abated photoelectric noise. Electrodes are positioned very close to light emitting points by non-planar microfabrication, with angled light emission allowing the simultaneous optogenetic manipulation and electrical read-out of one to three neurons, with no photoelectric artefacts, in vivo. The unconventional implementation of two-photon polymerization on the curved taper edge enables the fabrication of recoding sites all around the implant, making fibertrodes a promising complement to planar microimplants."
22,Direct correlation between void formation and lithium dendrite growth in solid-state electrolytes with interlayers,2022-06-02,"Solid-state Li-ion batteries with lithium anodes offer higher energy densities and are safer than conventional liquid electrolyte-based Li-ion batteries. However, the growth of lithium dendrites across the solid-state electrolyte layer leads to the premature shorting of cells and limits their practical viability. Here, using solid-state Li half-cells with metallic interlayers between a garnet-based lithium-ion conductor and lithium, we show that interfacial void growth precedes dendrite nucleation and growth. Specifically, void growth was observed at a current density of around two-thirds of the critical current density for dendrite growth. Computational calculations reveal that interlayer materials with higher critical current densities for dendrite growth also have the largest thermodynamic and kinetic barriers for lithium vacancy accumulation at their interfaces with lithium. Our results suggest that interfacial modification with suitable metallic interlayers decreases the tendency for void growth and improves dendrite growth tolerance in solid-state electrolytes, even in the absence of high stack pressures."
23,Superior radiation tolerance via reversible disordering–ordering transition of coherent superlattices,2022-05-30,"Materials capable of sustaining high radiation doses at a high temperature are required for next-generation fission and future fusion energy. To date, however, even the most promising structural materials cannot withstand the demanded radiation environment due to irreversible radiation-driven microstructure degradation. Here we report a counterintuitive strategy to achieve exceptionally high radiation tolerance at high temperatures by enabling reversible local disordering–ordering transition of the introduced superlattice nanoprecipitates in metallic materials. As particularly demonstrated in martensitic steel containing a high density of B2-ordered superlattices, no void swelling was detected even after ultrahigh-dose radiation damage at 400–600 °C. The reordering process of the low-misfit superlattices in highly supersaturated matrices occurs through the short-range reshuffling of radiation-induced point defects and excess solutes right after rapid, ballistic disordering. This dynamic process stabilizes the microstructure, continuously promotes in situ defect recombination and efficiently prevents the capillary-driven long-range diffusion process. The strategy can be readily applied into other materials and pave the pathway for developing materials with high radiation tolerance."
24,Spontaneous formation of metastable orientation with well-organized permanent dipole moment in organic glassy films,2022-05-30,"The performance of organic optoelectronic and energy-harvesting devices is largely determined by the molecular orientation and resultant permanent dipole moment, yet this property is difficult to control during film preparation. Here, we demonstrate the active control of dipole direction—that is, vector direction and magnitude—in organic glassy films by physical vapour deposition. An organic glassy film with metastable permanent dipole moment orientation can be obtained by utilizing the small surface free energy of a trifluoromethyl unit and intramolecular permanent dipole moment induced by functional groups. The proposed molecular design rule could pave a way toward the formation of spontaneously polarized organic glassy films, leading to improvement in the performance of organic molecular devices."
25,Self-generated gradients steer collective migration on viscoelastic collagen networks,2022-05-30,"Growing evidence suggests that the physical properties of the cellular microenvironment influence cell migration. However, it is not currently understood how active physical remodelling by cells affects migration dynamics. Here we report that cell clusters seeded on deformable collagen-I networks display persistent collective migration despite not showing any apparent intrinsic polarity. Clusters generate transient gradients in collagen density and alignment due to viscoelastic relaxation of the collagen networks. Combining theory and experiments, we show that crosslinking collagen networks or reducing cell cluster size results in reduced network deformation, shorter viscoelastic relaxation time and smaller gradients, leading to lower migration persistence. Traction force and Brillouin microscopy reveal asymmetries in force distributions and collagen stiffness during migration, providing evidence of mechanical cross-talk between cells and their substrate during migration. This physical model provides a mechanism for self-generated directional migration on viscoelastic substrates in the absence of internal biochemical polarity cues."
26,3D printed protein-based robotic structures actuated by molecular motor assemblies,2022-05-26,"Upscaling motor protein activity to perform work in man-made devices has long been an ambitious goal in bionanotechnology. The use of hierarchical motor assemblies, as realized in sarcomeres, has so far been complicated by the challenges of arranging sufficiently high numbers of motor proteins with nanoscopic precision. Here, we describe an alternative approach based on actomyosin cortex-like force production, allowing low complexity motor arrangements in a contractile meshwork that can be coated onto soft objects and locally activated by ATP. The design is reminiscent of a motorized exoskeleton actuating protein-based robotic structures from the outside. It readily supports the connection and assembly of micro-three-dimensional printed modules into larger structures, thereby scaling up mechanical work. We provide an analytical model of force production in these systems and demonstrate the design flexibility by three-dimensional printed units performing complex mechanical tasks, such as microhands and microarms that can grasp and wave following light activation."
27,Porosity-based heterojunctions enable leadless optoelectronic modulation of tissues,2022-05-26,"Homo- and heterojunctions play essential roles in semiconductor-based devices such as field-effect transistors, solar cells, photodetectors and light-emitting diodes. Semiconductor junctions have been recently used to optically trigger biological modulation via photovoltaic or photoelectrochemical mechanisms. The creation of heterojunctions typically involves materials with different doping or composition, which leads to high cost, complex fabrications and potential side effects at biointerfaces. Here we show that a porosity-based heterojunction, a largely overlooked system in materials science, can yield an efficient photoelectrochemical response from the semiconductor surface. Using self-limiting stain etching, we create a nanoporous/non-porous, soft–hard heterojunction in p-type silicon within seconds under ambient conditions. Upon surface oxidation, the heterojunction yields a strong photoelectrochemical response in saline. Without any interconnects or metal modifications, the heterojunction enables efficient non-genetic optoelectronic stimulation of isolated rat hearts ex vivo and sciatic nerves in vivo with optical power comparable to optogenetics, and with near-infrared capabilities."
28,Enabling ultra-low-voltage switching in BaTiO,2022-05-26,"Single crystals of BaTiO3 exhibit small switching fields and energies, but thin-film performance is considerably worse, thus precluding their use in next-generation devices. Here, we demonstrate high-quality BaTiO3 thin films with nearly bulk-like properties. Thickness scaling provides access to the coercive voltages (<100 mV) and fields (<10 kV cm−1) required for future applications and results in a switching energy of <2 J cm−3 (corresponding to <2 aJ per bit in a 10 × 10 × 10 nm3 device). While reduction in film thickness reduces coercive voltage, it does so at the expense of remanent polarization. Depolarization fields impact polar state stability in thicker films but fortunately suppress the coercive field, thus driving a deviation from Janovec–Kay–Dunn scaling and enabling a constant coercive field for films <150 nm in thickness. Switching studies reveal fast speeds (switching times of ~2 ns for 25-nm-thick films with 5-µm-diameter capacitors) and a pathway to subnanosecond switching. Finally, integration of BaTiO3 thin films onto silicon substrates is shown. We also discuss what remains to be demonstrated to enable the use of these materials for next-generation devices."
29,A single-atom library for guided monometallic and concentration-complex multimetallic designs,2022-05-23,"Atomically dispersed single-atom catalysts have the potential to bridge heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. Dozens of single-atom catalysts have been developed, and they exhibit notable catalytic activity and selectivity that are not achievable on metal surfaces. Although promising, there is limited knowledge about the boundaries for the monometallic single-atom phase space, not to mention multimetallic phase spaces. Here, single-atom catalysts based on 37 monometallic elements are synthesized using a dissolution-and-carbonization method, characterized and analysed to build the largest reported library of single-atom catalysts. In conjunction with in situ studies, we uncover unified principles on the oxidation state, coordination number, bond length, coordination element and metal loading of single atoms to guide the design of single-atom catalysts with atomically dispersed atoms anchored on N-doped carbon. We utilize the library to open up complex multimetallic phase spaces for single-atom catalysts and demonstrate that there is no fundamental limit on using single-atom anchor sites as structural units to assemble concentration-complex single-atom catalyst materials with up to 12 different elements. Our work offers a single-atom library spanning from monometallic to concentration-complex multimetallic materials for the rational design of single-atom catalysts."
30,STING agonist delivery by tumour-penetrating PEG-lipid nanodiscs primes robust anticancer immunity,2022-05-23,"Activation of the innate immune STimulator of INterferon Genes (STING) pathway potentiates antitumour immunity, but systemic delivery of STING agonists to tumours is challenging. We conjugated STING-activating cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) to PEGylated lipids (CDN-PEG-lipids; PEG, polyethylene glycol) via a cleavable linker and incorporated them into lipid nanodiscs (LNDs), which are discoid nanoparticles formed by self-assembly. Compared to state-of-the-art liposomes, intravenously administered LNDs carrying CDN-PEG-lipid (LND-CDNs) exhibited more efficient penetration of tumours, exposing the majority of tumour cells to STING agonist. A single dose of LND-CDNs induced rejection of established tumours, coincident with immune memory against tumour rechallenge. Although CDNs were not directly tumoricidal, LND-CDN uptake by cancer cells correlated with robust T-cell activation by promoting CDN and tumour antigen co-localization in dendritic cells. LNDs thus appear promising as a vehicle for robust delivery of compounds throughout solid tumours, which can be exploited for enhanced immunotherapy."
31,Nanotwinning-assisted dynamic recrystallization at high strains and strain rates,2022-05-19,"Grain refinement is a widely sought-after feature of many metal production processes and frequently involves a process of recrystallization. Some processing methods use very high strain rates and high strains to refine the grain structure into the nanocrystalline regime. However, grain refinement processes are not clear in these extreme conditions, which are hard to study systematically. Here, we access those extreme conditions of strain and strain rate using single copper microparticle impact events with a laser-induced particle impact tester. Using a combined dictionary-indexing electron backscatter diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy approach for postmortem characterization of impact sites, we systematically explore increasing strain levels and observe a recrystallization process that is facilitated by nanotwinning, which we term nanotwinning-assisted dynamic recrystallization. It achieves much finer grain sizes than established modes of recrystallization and therefore provides a pathway to the finest nanocrystalline grain sizes through extreme straining processes."
32,The visual appearances of disordered optical metasurfaces,2022-05-19,"Nanostructured materials have recently emerged as a promising approach for material appearance design. Research has mainly focused on creating structural colours by wave interference, leaving aside other important aspects that constitute the visual appearance of an object, such as the respective weight of specular and diffuse reflectances, object macroscopic shape, illumination and viewing conditions. Here we report the potential of disordered optical metasurfaces to harness visual appearance. We develop a multiscale modelling platform for the predictive rendering of macroscopic objects covered by metasurfaces in realistic settings, and show how nanoscale resonances and mesoscale interferences can be used to spectrally and angularly shape reflected light and thus create unusual visual effects at the macroscale. We validate this property with realistic synthetic images of macroscopic objects and centimetre-scale samples observable with the naked eye. This framework opens new perspectives in many branches of fine and applied visual arts."
33,Asynchronous current-induced switching of rare-earth and transition-metal sublattices in ferrimagnetic alloys,2022-05-12,"Ferrimagnetic alloys are model systems for understanding the ultrafast magnetization switching in materials with antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices. Here we investigate the dynamics of the rare-earth and transition-metal sublattices in ferrimagnetic GdFeCo and TbCo dots excited by spin–orbit torques with combined temporal, spatial and elemental resolution. We observe distinct switching regimes in which the magnetizations of the two sublattices either remain synchronized throughout the reversal process or switch following different trajectories in time and space. In the latter case, we observe a transient ferromagnetic state that lasts up to 2 ns. The asynchronous switching of the two magnetizations is ascribed to the master–agent dynamics induced by the spin–orbit torques on the transition-metal and rare-earth sublattices and their weak antiferromagnetic coupling, which depends sensitively on the alloy microstructure. Larger antiferromagnetic exchange leads to faster switching and shorter recovery of the magnetization after a current pulse. Our findings provide insight into the dynamics of ferrimagnets and the design of spintronic devices with fast and uniform switching."
34,Coupling between magnetic order and charge transport in a two-dimensional magnetic semiconductor,2022-05-05,"Semiconductors, featuring tunable electrical transport, and magnets, featuring tunable spin configurations, form the basis of many information technologies. A long-standing challenge has been to realize materials that integrate and connect these two distinct properties. Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer a platform to realize this concept, but known 2D magnetic semiconductors are electrically insulating in their magnetic phase. Here we demonstrate tunable electron transport within the magnetic phase of the 2D semiconductor CrSBr and reveal strong coupling between its magnetic order and charge transport. This provides an opportunity to characterize the layer-dependent magnetic order of CrSBr down to the monolayer via magnetotransport. Exploiting the sensitivity of magnetoresistance to magnetic order, we uncover a second regime characterized by coupling between charge carriers and magnetic defects. The magnetoresistance within this regime can be dynamically and reversibly tuned by varying the carrier concentration using an electrostatic gate, providing a mechanism for controlling charge transport in 2D magnets."
35,Single-junction organic solar cells with over 19% efficiency enabled by a refined double-fibril network morphology,2022-05-05,"In organic photovoltaics, morphological control of donor and acceptor domains on the nanoscale is the key for enabling efficient exciton diffusion and dissociation, carrier transport and suppression of recombination losses. To realize this, here, we demonstrated a double-fibril network based on a ternary donor–acceptor morphology with multi-length scales constructed by combining ancillary conjugated polymer crystallizers and a non-fullerene acceptor filament assembly. Using this approach, we achieved an average power conversion efficiency of 19.3% (certified 19.2%). The success lies in the good match between the photoelectric parameters and the morphological characteristic lengths, which utilizes the excitons and free charges efficiently. This strategy leads to an enhanced exciton diffusion length and a reduced recombination rate, hence minimizing photon-to-electron losses in the ternary devices as compared to their binary counterparts. The double-fibril network morphology strategy minimizes losses and maximizes the power output, offering the possibility of 20% power conversion efficiencies in single-junction organic photovoltaics."
36,Highly stretchable organic electrochemical transistors with strain-resistant performance,2022-05-02,"Realizing fully stretchable electronic materials is central to advancing new types of mechanically agile and skin-integrable optoelectronic device technologies. Here we demonstrate a materials design concept combining an organic semiconductor film with a honeycomb porous structure with biaxially prestretched platform that enables high-performance organic electrochemical transistors with a charge transport stability over 30–140% tensional strain, limited only by metal contact fatigue. The prestretched honeycomb semiconductor channel of donor–acceptor polymer poly(2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-diketo-pyrrolopyrrole-alt-2,5-bis(3-triethyleneglycoloxy-thiophen-2-yl) exhibits high ion uptake and completely stable electrochemical and mechanical properties over 1,500 redox cycles with 104 stretching cycles under 30% strain. Invariant electrocardiogram recording cycles and synapse responses under varying strains, along with mechanical finite element analysis, underscore that the present stretchable organic electrochemical transistor design strategy is suitable for diverse applications requiring stable signal output under deformation with low power dissipation and mechanical robustness."
37,Electrochemically induced amorphous-to-rock-salt phase transformation in niobium oxide electrode for Li-ion batteries,2022-05-02,"Intercalation-type metal oxides are promising negative electrode materials for safe rechargeable lithium-ion batteries due to the reduced risk of Li plating at low voltages. Nevertheless, their lower energy and power density along with cycling instability remain bottlenecks for their implementation, especially for fast-charging applications. Here, we report a nanostructured rock-salt Nb2O5 electrode formed through an amorphous-to-crystalline transformation during repeated electrochemical cycling with Li+. This electrode can reversibly cycle three lithiums per Nb2O5, corresponding to a capacity of 269 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1, and retains a capacity of 191 mAh g−1 at a high rate of 1 A g−1. It exhibits superb cycling stability with a capacity of 225 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1 for 400 cycles, and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.93%. We attribute the enhanced performance to the cubic rock-salt framework, which promotes low-energy migration paths. Our work suggests that inducing crystallization of amorphous nanomaterials through electrochemical cycling is a promising avenue for creating unconventional high-performance metal oxide electrode materials."
38,Trace removal of benzene vapour using double-walled metal–dipyrazolate frameworks,2022-04-28,"In principle, porous physisorbents are attractive candidates for the removal of volatile organic compounds such as benzene by virtue of their low energy for the capture and release of this pollutant. Unfortunately, many physisorbents exhibit weak sorbate–sorbent interactions, resulting in poor selectivity and low uptake when volatile organic compounds are present at trace concentrations. Herein, we report that a family of double-walled metal–dipyrazolate frameworks, BUT-53 to BUT-58, exhibit benzene uptakes at 298 K of 2.47–3.28 mmol g−1 at <10 Pa. Breakthrough experiments revealed that BUT-55, a supramolecular isomer of the metal–organic framework Co(BDP) (H2BDP = 1,4-di(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)benzene), captures trace levels of benzene, producing an air stream with benzene content below acceptable limits. Furthermore, BUT-55 can be regenerated with mild heating. Insight into the performance of BUT-55 comes from the crystal structure of the benzene-loaded phase (C6H6@BUT-55) and density functional theory calculations, which reveal that C–H···X interactions drive the tight binding of benzene. Our results demonstrate that BUT-55 is a recyclable physisorbent that exhibits high affinity and adsorption capacity towards benzene, making it a candidate for environmental remediation of benzene-contaminated gas mixtures."
39,Bimorphic Floquet topological insulators,2022-04-28,"Topological theories have established a unique set of rules that govern the transport properties in a wide variety of wave-mechanical settings. In a marked departure from the established approaches that induce Floquet topological phases by specifically tailored discrete coupling protocols or helical lattice motions, we introduce a class of bimorphic Floquet topological insulators that leverage connective chains with periodically modulated on-site potentials to reveal rich topological features in the system. In exploring a ‘chain-driven’ generalization of the archetypical Floquet honeycomb lattice, we identify a rich phase structure that can host multiple non-trivial topological phases associated simultaneously with both Chern-type and anomalous chiral states. Experiments carried out in photonic waveguide lattices reveal a strongly confined helical edge state that, owing to its origin in bulk flat bands, can be set into motion in a topologically protected fashion, or halted at will, without compromising its adherence to individual lattice sites."
40,Anomalous optical excitations from arrays of whirlpooled lattice distortions in moiré superlattices,2022-04-28,"Moiré superlattices formed by stacking two-dimensional crystals have reinvigorated the pursuit for emergent functionalities of engineered superlattices. Unique optical characteristics can be realized from the interplay between the electronic excitations and the atomic rearrangements owing to their intrinsic softness. Although large-scale reconstructions have been identified at small twist angles, they have been treated as being rigid at large twist angles. Here, we report that moiré superlattices made from single layers of MoS2 and WSe2 exhibit a pair of torsional strains with opposite chirality irrespective of the twist angle. The whirlpool-shaped periodic lattice distortions introduce fuzziness in the Raman spectra and universal redshifts to the intralayer excitons for all twist angles. We show that both of these modulations become weaker as the twist angle increases but do not disappear, whereas they are turned off when the constituent layers are not tightly coupled, thus establishing an essential structure–property relationship for moiré superlattices."
41,Renal clearable polyfluorophore nanosensors for early diagnosis of cancer and allograft rejection,2022-04-14,"Optical nanoparticles are promising diagnostic tools; however, their shallow optical imaging depth and slow clearance from the body have impeded their use for in vivo disease detection. To address these limitations, we develop activatable polyfluorophore nanosensors with biomarker-triggered nanoparticle-to-molecule pharmacokinetic conversion and near-infrared fluorogenic turn-on response. Activatable polyfluorophore nanosensors can accumulate at the disease site and react with disease-associated proteases to undergo in situ enzyme-catalysed depolymerization. This disease-specific interaction liberates renal-clearable fluorogenic fragments from activatable polyfluorophore nanosensors for non-invasive longitudinal urinalysis and outperforms the gold standard blood and urine assays, providing a level of sensitivity and specificity comparable to those of invasive biopsy and flow cytometry analysis. In rodent models, activatable polyfluorophore nanosensors enable ultrasensitive detection of tumours (1.6 mm diameter) and early diagnosis of acute liver allograft rejection. We anticipate that our modular nanosensor platform may be applied for early diagnosis of a range of diseases via a simple urine test."
42,Enhanced nanofluidic transport in activated carbon nanoconduits,2022-04-14,"Carbon has emerged as a unique material in nanofluidics, with reports of fast water transport, molecular ion separation and efficient osmotic energy conversion. Many of these phenomena still await proper rationalization due to the lack of fundamental understanding of nanoscale ionic transport, which can only be achieved in controlled environments. Here we develop the fabrication of ‘activated’ two-dimensional carbon nanochannels. Compared with nanoconduits with ‘pristine’ graphite walls, this enables the investigation of nanoscale ionic transport in great detail. We show that activated carbon nanochannels outperform pristine channels by orders of magnitude in terms of surface electrification, ionic conductance, streaming current and (epi-)osmotic currents. A detailed theoretical framework enables us to attribute the enhanced ionic transport across activated carbon nanochannels to an optimal combination of high surface charge and low friction. Furthermore, this demonstrates the unique potential of activated carbon for energy harvesting from salinity gradients with single-pore power density across activated carbon nanochannels, reaching hundreds of kilowatts per square metre, surpassing alternative nanomaterials."
43,Multiscale hierarchical structures from a nanocluster mesophase,2022-04-14,"Spontaneous hierarchical self-organization of nanometre-scale subunits into higher-level complex structures is ubiquitous in nature. The creation of synthetic nanomaterials that mimic the self-organization of complex superstructures commonly seen in biomolecules has proved challenging due to the lack of biomolecule-like building blocks that feature versatile, programmable interactions to render structural complexity. In this study, highly aligned structures are obtained from an organic–inorganic mesophase composed of monodisperse Cd37S18 magic-size cluster building blocks. Impressively, structural alignment spans over six orders of magnitude in length scale: nanoscale magic-size clusters arrange into a hexagonal geometry organized inside micrometre-sized filaments; self-assembly of these filaments leads to fibres that then organize into uniform arrays of centimetre-scale bands with well-defined surface periodicity. Enhanced patterning can be achieved by controlling processing conditions, resulting in bullseye and ‘zigzag’ stacking patterns with periodicity in two directions. Overall, we demonstrate that colloidal nanomaterials can exhibit a high level of self-organization behaviour at macroscopic-length scales."
44,Rydberg exciton–polaritons in a Cu,2022-04-14,"Giant Rydberg excitons with principal quantum numbers as high as n = 25 have been observed in cuprous oxide (Cu2O), a semiconductor in which the exciton diameter can become as large as ∼1 μm. The giant dimension of these excitons results in excitonic interaction enhancements of orders of magnitude. Rydberg exciton–polaritons, formed by the strong coupling of Rydberg excitons to cavity photons, are a promising route to exploit these interactions and achieve a scalable, strongly correlated solid-state platform. However, the strong coupling of these excitons to cavity photons has remained elusive. Here, by embedding a thin Cu2O crystal into a Fabry–Pérot microcavity, we achieve strong coupling of light to Cu2O Rydberg excitons up to n = 6 and demonstrate the formation of Cu2O Rydberg exciton–polaritons. These results pave the way towards realizing strongly interacting exciton–polaritons and exploring strongly correlated phases of matter using light on a chip."
45,An efficient nickel hydrogen oxidation catalyst for hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cells,2022-04-04,"The hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) is a promising energy conversion technology but is limited by the need for platinum group metal (PGM) electrocatalysts, especially for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). Here we report a Ni-based HOR catalyst that exhibits an electrochemical surface area-normalized exchange current density of 70 μA cm–2, the highest among PGM-free catalysts. The catalyst comprises Ni nanoparticles embedded in a nitrogen-doped carbon support. According to X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy as well as H2 chemisorption data, the electronic interaction between the Ni nanoparticles and the support leads to balanced hydrogen and hydroxide binding energies, which are the likely origin of the catalyst’s high activity. PGM-free HEMFCs employing this Ni-based HOR catalyst give a peak power density of 488 mW cm–2, up to 6.4 times higher than previous best-performing analogous HEMFCs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of efficient PGM-free HEMFCs."
46,Lithium superionic conductors with corner-sharing frameworks,2022-03-31,"Superionic lithium conductivity has only been discovered in a few classes of materials, mostly found in thiophosphates and rarely in oxides. Herein, we reveal that corner-sharing connectivity of the oxide crystal structure framework promotes superionic conductivity, which we rationalize from the distorted lithium environment and reduced interaction between lithium and non-lithium cations. By performing a high-throughput search for materials with this feature, we discover ten new oxide frameworks predicted to exhibit superionic conductivity—from which we experimentally demonstrate LiGa(SeO3)2 with a bulk ionic conductivity of 0.11 mS cm−1 and an activation energy of 0.17 eV. Our findings provide insight into the factors that govern fast lithium mobility in oxide materials and will accelerate the development of new oxide electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries."
47,Harmonic acoustics for dynamic and selective particle manipulation,2022-03-24,"Precise and selective manipulation of colloids and biological cells has long been motivated by applications in materials science, physics and the life sciences. Here we introduce our harmonic acoustics for a non-contact, dynamic, selective (HANDS) particle manipulation platform, which enables the reversible assembly of colloidal crystals or cells via the modulation of acoustic trapping positions with subwavelength resolution. We compose Fourier-synthesized harmonic waves to create soft acoustic lattices and colloidal crystals without using surface treatment or modifying their material properties. We have achieved active control of the lattice constant to dynamically modulate the interparticle distance in a high-throughput (>100 pairs), precise, selective and reversible manner. Furthermore, we apply this HANDS platform to quantify the intercellular adhesion forces among various cancer cell lines. Our biocompatible HANDS platform provides a highly versatile particle manipulation method that can handle soft matter and measure the interaction forces between living cells with high sensitivity."
48,Topological Wannier cycles induced by sub-unit-cell artificial gauge flux in a sonic crystal,2022-03-21,"Gauge fields play a major role in understanding quantum effects. For example, gauge flux insertion into single unit cells is crucial towards detecting quantum phases and controlling quantum dynamics and classical waves. However, the potential of gauge fields in topological materials studies has not been fully exploited. Here, we experimentally demonstrate artificial gauge flux insertion into a single plaquette of a sonic crystal with a gauge phase ranging from 0 to 2π. We insert the gauge flux through a three-step process of dimensional extension, engineering a screw dislocation and dimensional reduction. Additionally, the single-plaquette gauge flux leads to cyclic spectral flows across multiple bandgaps that manifest as topological boundary states on the plaquette and emerge only when the flux-carrying plaquette encloses the Wannier centres. We termed this phenomenon as the topological Wannier cycle. This work paves the way towards sub-unit-cell gauge flux, enabling future studies on synthetic gauge fields and topological materials."
49,"Disentangling water, ion and polymer dynamics in an anion exchange membrane",2022-03-17,"Semipermeable polymeric anion exchange membranes are essential for separation, filtration and energy conversion technologies including reverse electrodialysis systems that produce energy from salinity gradients, fuel cells to generate electrical power from the electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, and water electrolyser systems that provide H2 fuel. Anion exchange membrane fuel cells and anion exchange membrane water electrolysers rely on the membrane to transport OH− ions between the cathode and anode in a process that involves cooperative interactions with H2O molecules and polymer dynamics. Understanding and controlling the interactions between the relaxation and diffusional processes pose a main scientific and critical membrane design challenge. Here quasi-elastic neutron scattering is applied over a wide range of timescales (100–103 ps) to disentangle the water, polymer relaxation and OH− diffusional dynamics in commercially available anion exchange membranes (Fumatech FAD-55) designed for selective anion transport across different technology platforms, using the concept of serial decoupling of relaxation and diffusional processes to analyse the data. Preliminary data are also reported for a laboratory-prepared anion exchange membrane especially designed for fuel cell applications."
50,Coupling structural evolution and oxygen-redox electrochemistry in layered transition metal oxides,2022-03-17,"Lattice oxygen redox offers an unexplored way to access superior electrochemical properties of transition metal oxides (TMOs) for rechargeable batteries. However, the reaction is often accompanied by unfavourable structural transformations and persistent electrochemical degradation, thereby precluding the practical application of this strategy. Here we explore the close interplay between the local structural change and oxygen electrochemistry during short- and long-term battery operation for layered TMOs. The substantially distinct evolution of the oxygen-redox activity and reversibility are demonstrated to stem from the different cation-migration mechanisms during the dynamic de/intercalation process. We show that the π stabilization on the oxygen oxidation initially aids in the reversibility of the oxygen redox and is predominant in the absence of cation migrations; however, the π-interacting oxygen is gradually replaced by σ-interacting oxygen that triggers the formation of O–O dimers and structural destabilization as cycling progresses. More importantly, it is revealed that the distinct cation-migration paths available in the layered TMOs govern the conversion kinetics from π to σ interactions. These findings constitute a step forward in unravelling the correlation between the local structural evolution and the reversibility of oxygen electrochemistry and provide guidance for further development of oxygen-redox layered electrode materials."
51,3D-printed hierarchical pillar array electrodes for high-performance semi-artificial photosynthesis,2022-03-07,"The rewiring of photosynthetic biomachineries to electrodes is a forward-looking semi-artificial route for sustainable bio-electricity and fuel generation. Currently, it is unclear how the electrode and biomaterial interface can be designed to meet the complex requirements for high biophotoelectrochemical performance. Here we developed an aerosol jet printing method for generating hierarchical electrode structures using indium tin oxide nanoparticles. We printed libraries of micropillar array electrodes varying in height and submicrometre surface features, and studied the energy/electron transfer processes across the bio-electrode interfaces. When wired to the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, micropillar array electrodes with microbranches exhibited favourable biocatalyst loading, light utilization and electron flux output, ultimately almost doubling the photocurrent of state-of-the-art porous structures of the same height. When the micropillars’ heights were increased to 600 µm, milestone mediated photocurrent densities of 245 µA cm–2 (the closest thus far to theoretical predictions) and external quantum efficiencies of up to 29% could be reached. This study demonstrates how bio-energy from photosynthesis could be more efficiently harnessed in the future and provide new tools for three-dimensional electrode design."
52,Ultrafast exciton transport at early times in quantum dot solids,2022-03-07,"Quantum dot (QD) solids are an emerging platform for developing a range of optoelectronic devices. Thus, understanding exciton dynamics is essential towards developing and optimizing QD devices. Here, using transient absorption microscopy, we reveal the initial exciton dynamics in QDs with femtosecond timescales. We observe high exciton diffusivity (~102 cm2 s–1) in lead chalcogenide QDs within the first few hundred femtoseconds after photoexcitation followed by a transition to a slower regime (~10–1–1 cm2 s–1). QD solids with larger interdot distances exhibit higher initial diffusivity and a delayed transition to the slower regime, while higher QD packing density and heterogeneity accelerate this transition. The fast transport regime occurs only in materials with exciton Bohr radii much larger than the QD sizes, suggesting the transport of delocalized excitons in this regime and a transition to slower transport governed by exciton localization. These findings suggest routes to control the optoelectronic properties of QD solids."
53,Gate-tuneable and chirality-dependent charge-to-spin conversion in tellurium nanowires,2022-03-07,"Chiral materials are an ideal playground for exploring the relation between symmetry, relativistic effects and electronic transport. For instance, chiral organic molecules have been intensively studied to electrically generate spin-polarized currents in the last decade, but their poor electronic conductivity limits their potential for applications. Conversely, chiral inorganic materials such as tellurium have excellent electrical conductivity, but their potential for enabling the electrical control of spin polarization in devices remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate the all-electrical generation, manipulation and detection of spin polarization in chiral single-crystalline tellurium nanowires. By recording a large (up to 7%) and chirality-dependent unidirectional magnetoresistance, we show that the orientation of the electrically generated spin polarization is determined by the nanowire handedness and uniquely follows the current direction, while its magnitude can be manipulated by an electrostatic gate. Our results pave the way for the development of magnet-free chirality-based spintronic devices."
54,Tomographic measurement of dielectric tensors at optical frequency,2022-03-03,"The dielectric tensor is a physical descriptor of fundamental light–matter interactions, characterizing anisotropic materials with principal refractive indices and optic axes. Despite its importance in scientific and industrial applications ranging from material science to soft matter physics, the direct measurement of the three-dimensional dielectric tensor has been limited by the vectorial and inhomogeneous nature of light scattering from anisotropic materials. Here, we present a dielectric tensor tomographic approach to directly measure dielectric tensors of anisotropic structures including the spatial variations of principal refractive indices and directors. The anisotropic structure is illuminated with a polarized plane wave with various angles and polarization states. Then, the scattered fields are holographically measured and converted into vectorial diffracted field components. Finally, by inversely solving a vectorial wave equation, the three-dimensional dielectric tensor is reconstructed. Using this approach, we demonstrate quantitative tomographic measurements of various nematic liquid-crystal structures and their fast three-dimensional non-equilibrium dynamics."
55,"Superconductivity in (Ba,K)SbO",2022-02-28,"(Ba,K)BiO3 constitute an interesting class of superconductors, where the remarkably high superconducting transition temperature Tc of 30 K arises in proximity to charge density wave order. However, the precise mechanism behind these phases remains unclear. Here, enabled by high-pressure synthesis, we report superconductivity in (Ba,K)SbO3 with a positive oxygen–metal charge transfer energy in contrast to (Ba,K)BiO3. The parent compound BaSbO3−δ shows a larger charge density wave gap compared to BaBiO3. As the charge density wave order is suppressed via potassium substitution up to 65%, superconductivity emerges, rising up to Tc = 15 K. This value is lower than the maximum Tc of (Ba,K)BiO3, but higher by more than a factor of two at comparable potassium concentrations. The discovery of an enhanced charge density wave gap and superconductivity in (Ba,K)SbO3 indicates that strong oxygen–metal covalency may be more essential than the sign of the charge transfer energy in the main-group perovskite superconductors."
56,Tunable metal hydroxide–organic frameworks for catalysing oxygen evolution,2022-02-24,"The oxygen evolution reaction is central to making chemicals and energy carriers using electrons. Combining the great tunability of enzymatic systems with known oxide-based catalysts can create breakthrough opportunities to achieve both high activity and stability. Here we report a series of metal hydroxide–organic frameworks (MHOFs) synthesized by transforming layered hydroxides into two-dimensional sheets crosslinked using aromatic carboxylate linkers. MHOFs act as a tunable catalytic platform for the oxygen evolution reaction, where the π–π interactions between adjacent stacked linkers dictate stability, while the nature of transition metals in the hydroxides modulates catalytic activity. Substituting Ni-based MHOFs with acidic cations or electron-withdrawing linkers enhances oxygen evolution reaction activity by over three orders of magnitude per metal site, with Fe substitution achieving a mass activity of 80 A \({\rm{g}}_{\rm{catalyst}}^{-1}\) at 0.3 V overpotential for 20 h. Density functional theory calculations correlate the enhanced oxygen evolution reaction activity with the MHOF-based modulation of Ni redox and the optimized binding of oxygenated intermediates."
57,Multiple mobile excitons manifested as sidebands in quasi-one-dimensional metallic TaSe,2022-02-21,"Charge neutrality and their expected itinerant nature makes excitons potential transmitters of information. However, exciton mobility remains inaccessible to traditional optical experiments that only create and detect excitons with negligible momentum. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we detect dispersing excitons in the quasi-one-dimensional metallic trichalcogenide, TaSe3. The low density of conduction electrons and the low dimensionality in TaSe3 combined with a polaronic renormalization of the conduction band and the poorly screened interaction between these polarons and photo-induced valence holes leads to various excitonic bound states that we interpret as intrachain and interchain excitons, and possibly trions. The thresholds for the formation of a photo-hole together with an exciton appear as side valence bands with dispersions nearly parallel to the main valence band, but shifted to lower excitation energies. The energy separation between side and main valence bands can be controlled by surface doping, enabling the tuning of certain exciton properties."
58,Tough and stretchable ionogels by in situ phase separation,2022-02-21,"Ionogels are compelling materials for technological devices due to their excellent ionic conductivity, thermal and electrochemical stability, and non-volatility. However, most existing ionogels suffer from low strength and toughness. Here, we report a simple one-step method to achieve ultra-tough and stretchable ionogels by randomly copolymerizing two common monomers with distinct solubility of the corresponding polymers in an ionic liquid. Copolymerization of acrylamide and acrylic acid in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate results in a macroscopically homogeneous covalent network with in situ phase separation: a polymer-rich phase with hydrogen bonds that dissipate energy and toughen the ionogel; and an elastic solvent-rich phase that enables for large strain. These ionogels have high fracture strength (12.6 MPa), fracture energy (~24 kJ m−2) and Young’s modulus (46.5 MPa), while being highly stretchable (~600% strain) and having self-healing and shape-memory properties. This concept can be applied to other monomers and ionic liquids, offering a promising way to tune ionogel microstructure and properties in situ during one-step polymerization."
59,Correlative image learning of chemo-mechanics in phase-transforming solids,2022-02-17,"Constitutive laws underlie most physical processes in nature. However, learning such equations in heterogeneous solids (for example, due to phase separation) is challenging. One such relationship is between composition and eigenstrain, which governs the chemo-mechanical expansion in solids. Here we developed a generalizable, physically constrained image-learning framework to algorithmically learn the chemo-mechanical constitutive law at the nanoscale from correlative four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray spectro-ptychography images. We demonstrated this approach on LiXFePO4, a technologically relevant battery positive electrode material. We uncovered the functional form of the composition–eigenstrain relation in this two-phase binary solid across the entire composition range (0 ≤ X ≤ 1), including inside the thermodynamically unstable miscibility gap. The learned relation directly validates Vegard’s law of linear response at the nanoscale. Our physics-constrained data-driven approach directly visualizes the residual strain field (by removing the compositional and coherency strain), which is otherwise impossible to quantify. Heterogeneities in the residual strain arise from misfit dislocations and were independently verified by X-ray diffraction line profile analysis. Our work provides the means to simultaneously quantify chemical expansion, coherency strain and dislocations in battery electrodes, which has implications on rate capabilities and lifetime. Broadly, this work also highlights the potential of integrating correlative microscopy and image learning for extracting material properties and physics."
60,Stable non-corrosive sulfonimide salt for 4-V-class lithium metal batteries,2022-02-14,"Rechargeable lithium metal (Li0) batteries (RLMBs) are considered attractive for improving Li-ion batteries. Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) has been extensively used as a conducting salt for RLMBs due to its advantageous stability and innocuity. However, LiTFSI-based electrolytes are corrosive towards aluminium (Al0) current collectors at low potentials (>3.8 V versus Li/Li+), thereby excluding their application in 4-V-class RLMBs. Herein, we report on a non-corrosive sulfonimide salt, lithium (difluoromethanesulfonyl)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiDFTFSI), that remarkably suppresses the anodic dissolution of the Al0 current collector at high potentials (>4.2 V versus Li/Li+) and significantly improves the cycling performance of Li(Ni1/3Mn1/3Co1/3)O2 (NMC111) cells. In addition, this sulfonimide salt results in the growth of an advantageous solid electrolyte interphase on the Li0 electrode. The replacement of either LiTFSI or LiPF6 with LiDFTFSI endows a Li0||NMC111 cell with superior cycling stability and capacity retention (87% at cycle 200), demonstrating the decisive role of the salt anion in dictating the electrochemical performance of RLMBs."
61,Multipole polaron in the devil’s staircase of CeSb,2022-02-10,"Rare-earth intermetallic compounds exhibit rich phenomena induced by the interplay between localized f orbitals and conduction electrons. However, since the energy scale of the crystal-electric-field splitting is only a few millielectronvolts, the nature of the mobile electrons accompanied by collective crystal-electric-field excitations has not been unveiled. Here, we examine the low-energy electronic structures of CeSb through the anomalous magnetostructural transitions below the Néel temperature, ~17 K, termed the ‘devil’s staircase’, using laser angle-resolved photoemission, Raman and neutron scattering spectroscopies. We report another type of electron–boson coupling between mobile electrons and quadrupole crystal-electric-field excitations of the 4f orbitals, which renormalizes the Sb 5p band prominently, yielding a kink at a very low energy (~7 meV). This coupling strength is strong and exhibits anomalous step-like enhancement during the devil’s staircase transition, unveiling a new type of quasiparticle, named the ‘multipole polaron’, comprising a mobile electron dressed with a cloud of the quadrupole crystal-electric-field polarization."
62,Integer topological defects organize stresses driving tissue morphogenesis,2022-02-10,"Tissues acquire function and shape via differentiation and morphogenesis. Both processes are driven by coordinating cellular forces and shapes at the tissue scale, but general principles governing this interplay remain to be discovered. Here we report that self-organization of myoblasts around integer topological defects, namely spirals and asters, suffices to establish complex multicellular architectures. In particular, these arrangements can trigger localized cell differentiation or, alternatively, when differentiation is inhibited, they can drive the growth of swirling protrusions. Both localized differentiation and growth of cellular vortices require specific stress patterns. By analysing the experimental velocity and orientational fields through active gel theory, we show that integer topological defects can generate force gradients that concentrate compressive stresses. We reveal these gradients by assessing spatial changes in nuclear volume and deformations of elastic pillars. We propose integer topological defects as mechanical organizing centres controlling differentiation and morphogenesis."
63,The toughness of mechanical metamaterials,2022-02-07,"Rapid progress in additive manufacturing methods has created a new class of ultralight mechanical metamaterials with extreme functional properties. Their application is ultimately limited by their tolerance to damage and defects, but an understanding of this sensitivity has remained elusive. Using metamaterial specimens consisting of millions of unit cells, we show that not only is the stress intensity factor, as used in conventional elastic fracture mechanics, insufficient to characterize fracture, but also that conventional fracture testing protocols are inadequate. Via a combination of numerical and asymptotic analysis, we extend the ideas of elastic fracture mechanics to truss-based metamaterials and develop a general test and design protocol. This framework can form the basis for fracture characterization in other discrete elastic-brittle solids where the notion of fracture toughness is known to break down."
64,Universal scaling law of glass rheology,2022-01-31,"The similarity in atomic/molecular structure between liquids and glasses has stimulated a long-standing hypothesis that the nature of glasses may be more fluid-like, rather than the apparent solid. In principle, the nature of glasses can be characterized by the dynamic response of their rheology in a wide rate range, but this has not been realized experimentally, to the best of our knowledge. Here we report the dynamic response of shear stress to the shear strain rate of metallic glasses over a timescale of nine orders of magnitude, equivalent to hundreds of years, by broadband stress relaxation experiments. The dynamic response of the metallic glasses, together with other ‘glasses’, follows a universal scaling law within the framework of fluid dynamics. The universal scaling law provides comprehensive validation of the conjecture on the jamming (dynamic) phase diagram by which the dynamic behaviours of a wide variety of ‘glasses’ can be unified under one rubric parameterized by the thermodynamic variables of temperature, volume and stress in the trajectory space."
65,Geometrically stabilized skyrmionic vortex in FeGe tetrahedral nanoparticles,2022-01-27,"The concept of topology has dramatically expanded the research landscape of magnetism, leading to the discovery of numerous magnetic textures with intriguing topological properties. A magnetic skyrmion is an emergent topological magnetic texture with a string-like structure in three dimensions and a disk-like structure in one and two dimensions. Skyrmions in zero dimensions have remained elusive due to challenges from many competing orders. Here, by combining electron holography and micromagnetic simulations, we uncover the real-space magnetic configurations of a skyrmionic vortex structure confined in a B20-type FeGe tetrahedral nanoparticle. An isolated skyrmionic vortex forms at the ground state and this texture shows excellent robustness against temperature without applying a magnetic field. Our findings shed light on zero-dimensional geometrical confinement as a route to engineer and manipulate individual skyrmionic metastructures."
66,Tandem catalysis with double-shelled hollow spheres,2022-01-27,"Metal–zeolite composites with metal (oxide) and acid sites are promising catalysts for integrating multiple reactions in tandem to produce a wide variety of wanted products without separating or purifying the intermediates. However, the conventional design of such materials often leads to uncontrolled and non-ideal spatial distributions of the metal inside/on the zeolites, limiting their catalytic performance. Here we demonstrate a simple strategy for synthesizing double-shelled, contiguous metal oxide@zeolite hollow spheres (denoted as MO@ZEO DSHSs) with controllable structural parameters and chemical compositions. This involves the self-assembly of zeolite nanocrystals onto the surface of metal ion-containing carbon spheres followed by calcination and zeolite growth steps. The step-by-step formation mechanism of the material is revealed using mainly in situ Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction and ex situ electron microscopy. We demonstrate that it is due to this structure that an Fe2O3@H-ZSM-5 DSHSs-showcase catalyst exhibits superior performance compared with various conventionally structured Fe2O3-H-ZSM-5 catalysts in gasoline production by the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. This work is expected to advance the rational synthesis and research of hierarchically hollow, core–shell, multifunctional catalyst materials."
67,Wafer-scale single-crystal monolayer graphene grown on sapphire substrate,2022-01-20,"The growth of inch-scale high-quality graphene on insulating substrates is desirable for electronic and optoelectronic applications, but remains challenging due to the lack of metal catalysis. Here we demonstrate the wafer-scale synthesis of adlayer-free ultra-flat single-crystal monolayer graphene on sapphire substrates. We converted polycrystalline Cu foil placed on Al2O3(0001) into single-crystal Cu(111) film via annealing, and then achieved epitaxial growth of graphene at the interface between Cu(111) and Al2O3(0001) by multi-cycle plasma etching-assisted–chemical vapour deposition. Immersion in liquid nitrogen followed by rapid heating causes the Cu(111) film to bulge and peel off easily, while the graphene film remains on the sapphire substrate without degradation. Field-effect transistors fabricated on as-grown graphene exhibited good electronic transport properties with high carrier mobilities. This work breaks a bottleneck of synthesizing wafer-scale single-crystal monolayer graphene on insulating substrates and could contribute to next-generation graphene-based nanodevices."
68,Suspension electrolyte with modified Li,2022-01-17,"Designing a stable solid–electrolyte interphase on a Li anode is imperative to developing reliable Li metal batteries. Herein, we report a suspension electrolyte design that modifies the Li+ solvation environment in liquid electrolytes and creates inorganic-rich solid–electrolyte interphases on Li. Li2O nanoparticles suspended in liquid electrolytes were investigated as a proof of concept. Through theoretical and empirical analyses of Li2O suspension electrolytes, the roles played by Li2O in the liquid electrolyte and solid–electrolyte interphases of the Li anode are elucidated. Also, the suspension electrolyte design is applied in conventional and state-of-the-art high-performance electrolytes to demonstrate its applicability. Based on electrochemical analyses, improved Coulombic efficiency (up to ~99.7%), reduced Li nucleation overpotential, stabilized Li interphases and prolonged cycle life of anode-free cells (~70 cycles at 80% of initial capacity) were achieved with the suspension electrolytes. We expect this design principle and our findings to be expanded into developing electrolytes and solid–electrolyte interphases for Li metal batteries."
69,Hydride-ion-conducting K,2022-01-13,"Hydrogen transport in solids, applied in electrochemical devices such as fuel cells and electrolysis cells, is key to sustainable energy societies. Although using proton (H+) conductors is an attractive choice, practical conductivity at intermediate temperatures (200–400 °C), which would be ideal for most energy and chemical conversion applications, remains a challenge. Alternatively, hydride ions (H–), that is, monovalent anions with high polarizability, can be considered a promising charge carrier that facilitates fast ionic conduction in solids. Here, we report a K2NiF4-type Ba–Li oxyhydride with an appreciable amount of hydrogen vacancies that presents long-range order at room temperature. Increasing the temperature results in the disappearance of the vacancy ordering, triggering a high and essentially temperature-independent H– conductivity of more than 0.01 S cm–1 above 315 °C. Such a remarkable H– conducting nature at intermediate temperatures is anticipated to be important for energy and chemical conversion devices."
70,Photo-enhanced ionic conductivity across grain boundaries in polycrystalline ceramics,2022-01-13,"Grain boundary conductivity limitations are ubiquitous in material science. We show that illumination with above-bandgap light can decrease the grain boundary resistance in solid ionic conductors. Specifically, we demonstrate the increase of the grain boundary conductance of a 3 mol% Gd-doped ceria thin film by a factor of approximately 3.5 at 250 °C and the reduction of its activation energy from 1.12 to 0.68 eV under illumination, while light-induced heating and electronic conductivity could be excluded as potential sources for the observed opto-ionic effect. The presented model predicts that photo-generated electrons decrease the potential barrier heights associated with space charge zones depleted in charge carriers between adjacent grains. The discovered opto-ionic effect could pave the way for the development of new electrochemical storage and conversion technologies operating at lower temperatures and/or higher efficiencies and could be further used for fast and contactless control or diagnosis of ionic conduction in polycrystalline solids."
71,The emergence of valency in colloidal crystals through electron equivalents,2022-01-13,"Colloidal crystal engineering of complex, low-symmetry architectures is challenging when isotropic building blocks are assembled. Here we describe an approach to generating such structures based upon programmable atom equivalents (nanoparticles functionalized with many DNA strands) and mobile electron equivalents (small particles functionalized with a low number of DNA strands complementary to the programmable atom equivalents). Under appropriate conditions, the spatial distribution of the electron equivalents breaks the symmetry of isotropic programmable atom equivalents, akin to the anisotropic distribution of valence electrons or coordination sites around a metal atom, leading to a set of well-defined coordination geometries and access to three new low-symmetry crystalline phases. All three phases represent the first examples of colloidal crystals, with two of them having elemental analogues (body-centred tetragonal and high-pressure gallium), while the third (triple double-gyroid structure) has no known natural equivalent. This approach enables the creation of complex, low-symmetry colloidal crystals that might find use in various technologies."
72,A smart and responsive crystalline porous organic cage membrane with switchable pore apertures for graded molecular sieving,2022-01-10,"Membranes with high selectivity offer an attractive route to molecular separations, where technologies such as distillation and chromatography are energy intensive. However, it remains challenging to fine tune the structure and porosity in membranes, particularly to separate molecules of similar size. Here, we report a process for producing composite membranes that comprise crystalline porous organic cage films fabricated by interfacial synthesis on a polyacrylonitrile support. These membranes exhibit ultrafast solvent permeance and high rejection of organic dyes with molecular weights over 600 g mol−1. The crystalline cage film is dynamic, and its pore aperture can be switched in methanol to generate larger pores that provide increased methanol permeance and higher molecular weight cut-offs (1,400 g mol−1). By varying the water/methanol ratio, the film can be switched between two phases that have different selectivities, such that a single, ‘smart’ crystalline membrane can perform graded molecular sieving. We exemplify this by separating three organic dyes in a single-stage, single-membrane process."
73,The Ising triangular-lattice antiferromagnet neodymium heptatantalate as a quantum spin liquid candidate,2021-12-30,"Disordered magnetic states known as spin liquids are of paramount importance in both fundamental and applied science. A classical state of this kind was predicted for the Ising antiferromagnetic triangular model, while additional non-commuting exchange terms were proposed to induce its quantum version—a quantum spin liquid. However, these predictions have not yet been confirmed experimentally. Here, we report evidence for such a state in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet NdTa7O19. We determine its magnetic ground state, which is characterized by effective spin-1/2 degrees of freedom with Ising-like nearest-neighbour correlations and gives rise to spin excitations persisting down to the lowest accessible temperature of 40 mK. Our study demonstrates the key role of strong spin–orbit coupling in stabilizing spin liquids that result from magnetic anisotropy and highlights the large family of rare-earth (RE) heptatantalates RETa7O19 as a framework for realization of these states, which represent a promising platform for quantum applications."
74,Inter-facet junction effects on particulate photoelectrodes,2021-12-24,"Particulate semiconductor photocatalysts are paramount for many solar energy conversion technologies. In anisotropically shaped photocatalyst particles, the different constituent facets may form inter-facet junctions at their adjoining edges, analogous to lateral two-dimensional (2D) heterojunctions or pseudo-2D junctions made of few-layer 2D materials. Using subfacet-level multimodal functional imaging, we uncover inter-facet junction effects on anisotropically shaped bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) particles and identify the characteristics of near-edge transition zones on the particle surface, which underpin the whole-particle photoelectrochemistry. We further show that chemical doping modulates the widths of such near-edge surface transition zones, consequently altering particles’ performance. Decoupled facet-size scaling laws further translate inter-facet junction effects into quantitative particle-size engineering principles, revealing surprising multiphasic size dependences of whole-particle photoelectrode performance. The imaging tools, the analytical framework and the inter-facet junction concept pave new avenues towards understanding, predicting and engineering (opto)electronic and photoelectrochemical properties of faceted semiconducting materials, with broad implications in energy science and semiconductor technology."
75,Competing correlated states around the zero-field Wigner crystallization transition of electrons in two dimensions,2021-12-23,"The competition between kinetic energy and Coulomb interactions in electronic systems leads to complex many-body ground states with competing orders. Here we present zinc oxide-based two-dimensional electron systems as a high-mobility system to study the low-temperature phases of strongly interacting electrons. An analysis of the electronic transport provides evidence for competing correlated metallic and insulating states with varying degrees of spin polarization. Some features bear quantitative resemblance to quantum Monte Carlo simulation results, including the transition point from the paramagnetic Fermi liquid to Wigner crystal and the absence of a Stoner transition. At very low temperatures, we resolve a non-monotonic spin polarizability of electrons across the phase transition, pointing towards a low spin phase of electrons, and a two-order-of-magnitude positive magnetoresistance that is challenging to understand within traditional metallic transport paradigms. This work establishes zinc oxide as a platform for studying strongly correlated electrons in two dimensions."
76,"Extremely long-range, high-temperature Josephson coupling across a half-metallic ferromagnet",2021-12-02,"The Josephson effect results from the coupling of two superconductors across a spacer such as an insulator, a normal metal or a ferromagnet to yield a phase coherent quantum state. However, in junctions with ferromagnetic spacers, very long-range Josephson effects have remained elusive. Here we demonstrate extremely long-range (micrometric) high-temperature (tens of kelvins) Josephson coupling across the half-metallic manganite La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 combined with the superconducting cuprate YBa2Cu3O7. These planar junctions, in addition to large critical currents, display the hallmarks of Josephson physics, such as critical current oscillations driven by magnetic flux quantization and quantum phase locking effects under microwave excitation (Shapiro steps). The latter display an anomalous doubling of the Josephson frequency predicted by several theories. In addition to its fundamental interest, the marriage between high-temperature, dissipationless quantum coherent transport and full spin polarization brings opportunities for the practical realization of superconducting spintronics, and opens new perspectives for quantum computing."
77,Engineering living and regenerative fungal–bacterial biocomposite structures,2021-12-02,"Engineered living materials could have the capacity to self-repair and self-replicate, sense local and distant disturbances in their environment, and respond with functionalities for reporting, actuation or remediation. However, few engineered living materials are capable of both responsivity and use in macroscopic structures. Here we describe the development, characterization and engineering of a fungal–bacterial biocomposite grown on lignocellulosic feedstocks that can form mouldable, foldable and regenerative living structures. We have developed strategies to make human-scale biocomposite structures using mould-based and origami-inspired growth and assembly paradigms. Microbiome profiling of the biocomposite over multiple generations enabled the identification of a dominant bacterial component, Pantoea agglomerans, which was further isolated and developed into a new chassis. We introduced engineered P. agglomerans into native feedstocks to yield living blocks with new biosynthetic and sensing–reporting capabilities. Bioprospecting the native microbiota to develop engineerable chassis constitutes an important strategy to facilitate the development of living biomaterials with new properties and functionalities."
78,Organic long-persistent luminescence stimulated by visible light in p-type systems based on organic photoredox catalyst dopants,2021-11-29,"Organic long-persistent-luminescent (OLPL) materials demonstrating hour-long photoluminescence have practical advantages in applications owing to their flexible design and easy processability. However, the energy absorbed in these materials is typically stored in an intermediate charge-separated state that is unstable when exposed to oxygen, thus preventing persistent luminescence in air unless oxygen penetration is suppressed through crystallization. Moreover, OLPL materials usually require ultraviolet excitation. Here we overcome such limitations and demonstrate amorphous OLPL systems that can be excited by radiation up to 600 nm and exhibit persistent luminescence in air. By adding cationic photoredox catalysts as electron-accepting dopants in a neutral electron-donor host, stable charge-separated states are generated by hole diffusion in these blends. Furthermore, the addition of hole-trapping molecules extends the photoluminescence lifetime. By using a p-type host less reactive to oxygen and tuning the donor–acceptor energy gap, our amorphous blends exhibit persistent luminescence stimulated by visible light even in air, expanding the applicability of OLPL materials."
79,Memristive control of mutual spin Hall nano-oscillator synchronization for neuromorphic computing,2021-11-29,"Synchronization of large spin Hall nano-oscillator (SHNO) arrays is an appealing approach toward ultrafast non-conventional computing. However, interfacing to the array, tuning its individual oscillators and providing built-in memory units remain substantial challenges. Here, we address these challenges using memristive gating of W/CoFeB/MgO/AlOx-based SHNOs. In its high resistance state, the memristor modulates the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy at the CoFeB/MgO interface by the applied electric field. In its low resistance state the memristor adds or subtracts current to the SHNO drive. Both electric field and current control affect the SHNO auto-oscillation mode and frequency, allowing us to reversibly turn on/off mutual synchronization in chains of four SHNOs. We also demonstrate that two individually controlled memristors can be used to tune a four-SHNO chain into differently synchronized states. Memristor gating is therefore an efficient approach to input, tune and store the state of SHNO arrays for non-conventional computing models."
80,In situ imaging of amorphous intermediates during brucite carbonation in supercritical CO,2021-11-29,"Progress in understanding crystallization pathways depends on the ability to unravel relationships between intermediates and final crystalline products at the nanoscale, which is a particular challenge at elevated pressure and temperature. Here we exploit a high-pressure atomic force microscope to directly visualize brucite carbonation in water-bearing supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) at 90 bar and 50 °C. On introduction of water-saturated scCO2, in situ visualization revealed initial dissolution followed by nanoparticle nucleation consistent with amorphous magnesium carbonate (AMC) on the surface. This is followed by growth of nesquehonite (MgCO3·3H2O) crystallites. In situ imaging provided direct evidence that the AMC intermediate acts as a seed for crystallization of nesquehonite. In situ infrared and thermogravimetric–mass spectrometry indicate that the stoichiometry of AMC is MgCO3·xH2O (x = 0.5–1.0), while its structure is indicated to be hydromagnesite-like according to density functional theory and X-ray pair distribution function analysis. Our findings thus provide insight for understanding the stability, lifetime and role of amorphous intermediates in natural and synthetic systems."
81,Atomic-scale observation of non-classical nucleation-mediated phase transformation in a titanium alloy,2021-11-25,"Two-phase titanium-based alloys are widely used in aerospace and biomedical applications, and they are obtained through phase transformations between a low-temperature hexagonal closed-packed α-phase and a high-temperature body-centred cubic β-phase. Understanding how a new phase evolves from its parent phase is critical to controlling the transforming microstructures and thus material properties. Here, we report time-resolved experimental evidence, at sub-ångström resolution, of a non-classically nucleated metastable phase that bridges the α-phase and the β-phase, in a technologically important titanium–molybdenum alloy. We observed a nanosized and chemically ordered superstructure in the α-phase matrix; its composition, chemical order and crystal structure are all found to be different from both the parent and the product phases, but instigating a vanishingly low energy barrier for the transformation into the β-phase. This latter phase transition can proceed instantly via vibrational switching when the molybdenum concentration in the superstructure exceeds a critical value. We expect that such a non-classical phase evolution mechanism is much more common than previously believed for solid-state transformations."
82,Effect of crystallite geometries on electrochemical performance of porous intercalation electrodes by multiscale operando investigation,2021-11-25,"Lithium-ion batteries are yet to realize their full promise because of challenges in the design and construction of electrode architectures that allow for their entire interior volumes to be reversibly accessible for ion storage. Electrodes constructed from the same material and with the same specifications, which differ only in terms of dimensions and geometries of the constituent particles, can show surprising differences in polarization, stress accumulation and capacity fade. Here, using operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDXRD), we probe the mechanistic origins of the remarkable particle geometry-dependent modification of lithiation-induced phase transformations in V2O5 as a model phase-transforming cathode. A pronounced modulation of phase coexistence regimes is observed as a function of particle geometry. Specifically, a metastable phase is stabilized for nanometre-sized spherical V2O5 particles, to circumvent the formation of large misfit strains. Spatially resolved EDXRD measurements demonstrate that particle geometries strongly modify the tortuosity of the porous cathode architecture. Greater ion-transport limitations in electrode architectures comprising micrometre-sized platelets result in considerable lithiation heterogeneities across the thickness of the electrode. These insights establish particle geometry-dependent modification of metastable phase regimes and electrode tortuosity as key design principles for realizing the promise of intercalation cathodes."
83,Highly compressible glass-like supramolecular polymer networks,2021-11-25,"Supramolecular polymer networks are non-covalently crosslinked soft materials that exhibit unique mechanical features such as self-healing, high toughness and stretchability. Previous studies have focused on optimizing such properties using fast-dissociative crosslinks (that is, for an aqueous system, dissociation rate constant kd > 10 s−1). Herein, we describe non-covalent crosslinkers with slow, tuneable dissociation kinetics (kd < 1 s−1) that enable high compressibility to supramolecular polymer networks. The resultant glass-like supramolecular networks have compressive strengths up to 100 MPa with no fracture, even when compressed at 93% strain over 12 cycles of compression and relaxation. Notably, these networks show a fast, room-temperature self-recovery (< 120 s), which may be useful for the design of high-performance soft materials. Retarding the dissociation kinetics of non-covalent crosslinks through structural control enables access of such glass-like supramolecular materials, holding substantial promise in applications including soft robotics, tissue engineering and wearable bioelectronics."
84,Giant anomalous Nernst signal in the antiferromagnet YbMnBi,2021-11-22,"A large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) is crucial for thermoelectric energy conversion applications because the associated unique transverse geometry facilitates module fabrication. Topological ferromagnets with large Berry curvatures show large ANEs; however, they face drawbacks such as strong magnetic disturbances and low mobility due to high magnetization. Herein, we demonstrate that YbMnBi2, a canted antiferromagnet, has a large ANE conductivity of ~10 A m−1 K−1 that surpasses large values observed in other ferromagnets (3–5 A m−1 K−1). The canted spin structure of Mn guarantees a non-zero Berry curvature, but generates only a weak magnetization three orders of magnitude lower than that of general ferromagnets. The heavy Bi with a large spin–orbit coupling enables a large ANE and low thermal conductivity, whereas its highly dispersive px/y orbitals ensure low resistivity. The high anomalous transverse thermoelectric performance and extremely small magnetization make YbMnBi2 an excellent candidate for transverse thermoelectrics."
85,Fabrication and nanophotonic waveguide integration of silicon carbide colour centres with preserved spin-optical coherence,2021-11-18,"Optically addressable spin defects in silicon carbide (SiC) are an emerging platform for quantum information processing compatible with nanofabrication processes and device control used by the semiconductor industry. System scalability towards large-scale quantum networks demands integration into nanophotonic structures with efficient spin–photon interfaces. However, degradation of the spin-optical coherence after integration in nanophotonic structures has hindered the potential of most colour centre platforms. Here, we demonstrate the implantation of silicon vacancy centres (VSi) in SiC without deterioration of their intrinsic spin-optical properties. In particular, we show nearly lifetime-limited photon emission and high spin-coherence times for single defects implanted in bulk as well as in nanophotonic waveguides created by reactive ion etching. Furthermore, we take advantage of the high spin-optical coherences of VSi centres in waveguides to demonstrate controlled operations on nearby nuclear spin qubits, which is a crucial step towards fault-tolerant quantum information distribution based on cavity quantum electrodynamics."
86,Zwitterionic materials with disorder and plasticity and their application as non-volatile solid or liquid electrolytes,2021-11-18,"Zwitterionic materials can exhibit unique characteristics and are highly tunable by variation to the covalently bound cationic and anionic moieties. Despite the breadth of properties and potential uses reported to date, for electrolyte applications they have thus far primarily been used as additives or for making polymer gels. However, zwitterions offer intriguing promise as electrolyte matrix materials that are non-volatile and charged but non-migrating. Here we report a family of zwitterions that exhibit molecular disorder and plasticity, which allows their use as a solid-state conductive matrix. We have characterized the thermal, morphological and structural properties of these materials using techniques including differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, solid-state NMR and X-ray crystallography. We report the physical and transport properties of zwitterions combined with lithium salts and a lithium-functionalized polymer to form solid or high-salt-content liquid electrolytes. We demonstrate that the zwitterion-based electrolytes can allow high target ion transport and support stable lithium metal cell cycling. The ability to use disordered zwitterionic materials as electrolyte matrices for high target ion conduction, coupled with an extensive scope for varying the chemical and physical properties, has important implications for the future design of non-volatile materials that bridge the choice between traditional molecular and ionic solvent systems."
87,Interface polarization in heterovalent core–shell nanocrystals,2021-11-18,"The potential profile and the energy level offset of core–shell heterostructured nanocrystals (h-NCs) determine the photophysical properties and the charge transport characteristics of h-NC solids. However, limited material choices for heavy metal-free III-V–II-VI h-NCs pose challenges in comprehensive control of the potential profile. Herein, we present an approach to such a control by steering dipole densities at the interface of III-V–II-VI h-NCs. The controllable heterovalency at the interface is responsible for interfacial dipole densities that result in the vacuum-level shift, providing an additional knob for the control of optical and electrical characteristics of h-NCs. The synthesis of h-NCs with atomic precision allows us to correlate interfacial dipole moments with the NCs’ photochemical stability and optoelectronic performance."
88,Synthetic dynamic hydrogels promote degradation-independent in vitro organogenesis,2021-11-15,"Epithelial organoids are most efficiently grown from mouse-tumour-derived, reconstituted extracellular matrix hydrogels, whose poorly defined composition, batch-to-batch variability and immunogenicity limit clinical applications. Efforts to replace such ill-defined matrices for organoid culture have largely focused on non-adaptable hydrogels composed of covalently crosslinked hydrophilic macromolecules. However, the excessive forces caused by tissue expansion in such elastic gels severely restrict organoid growth and morphogenesis. Chemical or enzymatic degradation schemes can partially alleviate this problem, but due to their irreversibility, long-term applicability is limited. Here we report a family of synthetic hydrogels that promote extensive organoid morphogenesis through dynamic rearrangements mediated by reversible hydrogen bonding. These tunable matrices are stress relaxing and thus promote efficient crypt budding in intestinal stem-cell epithelia through increased symmetry breaking and Paneth cell formation dependent on yes-associated protein 1. As such, these well-defined gels provide promising versatile matrices for fostering elaborate in vitro morphogenesis."
89,Direct visualization of the three-dimensional shape of skyrmion strings in a noncentrosymmetric magnet,2021-11-11,"Magnetic skyrmions are topologically stable swirling spin textures that appear as particle-like objects in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Here, utilizing scalar magnetic X-ray tomography under applied magnetic fields, we report the direct visualization of the three-dimensional (3D) shape of individual skyrmion strings in the room-temperature skyrmion-hosting non-centrosymmetric compound Mn1.4Pt0.9Pd0.1Sn. Through the tomographic reconstruction of the 3D distribution of the [001] magnetization component on the basis of transmission images taken at various angles, we identify a skyrmion string running through the entire thickness of the sample, as well as various defect structures, such as the interrupted and Y-shaped strings. The observed point defect may represent the Bloch point serving as an emergent magnetic monopole, as proposed theoretically. Our tomographic approach with a tunable magnetic field paves the way for direct visualization of the structural dynamics of individual skyrmion strings in 3D space, which will contribute to a better understanding of the creation, annihilation and transfer of these topological objects."
90,Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) organic molecules for efficient X-ray scintillation and imaging,2021-11-11,"X-ray detection, which plays an important role in medical and industrial fields, usually relies on inorganic scintillators to convert X-rays to visible photons; although several high-quantum-yield fluorescent molecules have been tested as scintillators, they are generally less efficient. High-energy radiation can ionize molecules and create secondary electrons and ions. As a result, a high fraction of triplet states is generated, which act as scintillation loss channels. Here we found that X-ray-induced triplet excitons can be exploited for emission through very rapid, thermally activated up-conversion. We report scintillators based on three thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules with different emission bands, which showed significantly higher efficiency than conventional anthracene-based scintillators. X-ray imaging with 16.6 line pairs mm−1 resolution was also demonstrated. These results highlight the importance of efficient and prompt harvesting of triplet excitons for efficient X-ray scintillation and radiation detection."
91,Electronic screening using a virtual Thomas–Fermi fluid for predicting wetting and phase transitions of ionic liquids at metal surfaces,2021-11-11,"Of relevance to energy storage, electrochemistry and catalysis, ionic and dipolar liquids display unexpected behaviours—especially in confinement. Beyond adsorption, over-screening and crowding effects, experiments have highlighted novel phenomena, such as unconventional screening and the impact of the electronic nature—metallic versus insulating—of the confining surface. Such behaviours, which challenge existing frameworks, highlight the need for tools to fully embrace the properties of confined liquids. Here we introduce a novel approach that involves electronic screening while capturing molecular aspects of interfacial fluids. Although available strategies consider perfect metal or insulator surfaces, we build on the Thomas–Fermi formalism to develop an effective approach that deals with any imperfect metal between these asymptotes. Our approach describes electrostatic interactions within the metal through a ‘virtual’ Thomas–Fermi fluid of charged particles, whose Debye length sets the screening length λ. We show that this method captures the electrostatic interaction decay and electrochemical behaviour on varying λ. By applying this strategy to an ionic liquid, we unveil a wetting transition on switching from insulating to metallic conditions."
92,Large-scale fabrication of structurally coloured cellulose nanocrystal films and effect pigments,2021-11-11,"Cellulose nanocrystals are renewable plant-based colloidal particles capable of forming photonic films by solvent-evaporation-driven self-assembly. So far, the cellulose nanocrystal self-assembly process has been studied only at a small scale, neglecting the limitations and challenges posed by the continuous deposition processes that are required to exploit this sustainable material in an industrial context. Here, we addressed these limitations by using roll-to-roll deposition to produce large-area photonic films, which required optimization of the formulation of the cellulose nanocrystal suspension and the deposition and drying conditions. Furthermore, we showed how metre-long structurally coloured films can be processed into effect pigments and glitters that are dispersible, even in water-based formulations. These promising effect pigments are an industrially relevant cellulose-based alternative to current products that are either micro-polluting (for example, non-biodegradable microplastic glitters) or based on carcinogenic, unsustainable or unethically sourced compounds (for example, titania or mica)."
93,Photocurrent-driven transient symmetry breaking in the Weyl semimetal TaAs,2021-11-08,"Symmetry plays a central role in conventional and topological phases of matter, making the ability to optically drive symmetry changes a critical step in developing future technologies that rely on such control. Topological materials, like topological semimetals, are particularly sensitive to a breaking or restoring of time-reversal and crystalline symmetries, which affect both bulk and surface electronic states. While previous studies have focused on controlling symmetry via coupling to the crystal lattice, we demonstrate here an all-electronic mechanism based on photocurrent generation. Using second harmonic generation spectroscopy as a sensitive probe of symmetry changes, we observe an ultrafast breaking of time-reversal and spatial symmetries following femtosecond optical excitation in the prototypical type-I Weyl semimetal TaAs. Our results show that optically driven photocurrents can be tailored to explicitly break electronic symmetry in a generic fashion, opening up the possibility of driving phase transitions between symmetry-protected states on ultrafast timescales."
94,Data-driven discovery of a universal indicator for metallic glass forming ability,2021-11-04,"Despite the importance of glass forming ability as a major alloy characteristic, it is poorly understood and its quantification has been experimentally laborious and computationally challenging. Here, we uncover that the glass forming ability of an alloy is represented in its amorphous structure far away from equilibrium, which can be exposed by conventional X-ray diffraction. Specifically, we fabricated roughly 5,700 alloys from 12 alloy systems and characterized the full-width at half-maximum, Δq, of the first diffraction peak in the X-ray diffraction pattern. A strong correlation between high glass forming ability and a large Δq was found. This correlation indicates that a large dispersion of structural units comprising the amorphous structure is the universal indicator for high metallic glass formation. When paired with combinatorial synthesis, the correlation enhances throughput by up to 100 times compared to today’s state-of-the-art combinatorial methods and will facilitate the discovery of bulk metallic glasses."
95,Free energy difference to create the M-OH,2021-11-01,"Theoretical descriptors differentiate the catalytic activity of materials for the oxygen evolution reaction by the strength of oxygen binding in the reactive intermediate created upon electron transfer. Recently, time-resolved spectroscopy of a photo-electrochemically driven oxygen evolution reaction followed the vibrational and optical spectra of this intermediate, denoted M-OH*. However, these inherently kinetic experiments have not been connected to the relevant thermodynamic quantities. Here we discover that picosecond optical spectra of the Ti-OH* population on lightly doped SrTiO3 are ordered by the surface hydroxylation. A Langmuir isotherm as a function of pH extracts an effective equilibrium constant relatable to the free energy difference of the first oxygen evolution reaction step. Thus, time-resolved spectroscopy of the catalytic surface reveals both kinetic and energetic information of elementary reaction steps, which provides a critical new connection between theory and experiment by which to tailor the pathway of water oxidation and other surface reactions."
96,Ultra-low-density digitally architected carbon with a strutted tube-in-tube structure,2021-10-25,"Porous materials with engineered stretching-dominated lattice designs, which offer attractive mechanical properties with ultra-light weight and large surface area for wide-ranging applications, have recently achieved near-ideal linear scaling between stiffness and density. Here, rather than optimizing the microlattice topology, we explore a different approach to strengthen low-density structural materials by designing tube-in-tube beam structures. We develop a process to transform fully dense, three-dimensional printed polymeric beams into graphitic carbon hollow tube-in-tube sandwich morphologies, where, similar to grass stems, the inner and outer tubes are connected through a network of struts. Compression tests and computational modelling show that this change in beam morphology dramatically slows down the decrease in stiffness with decreasing density. In situ pillar compression experiments further demonstrate large deformation recovery after 30–50% compression and high specific damping merit index. Our strutted tube-in-tube design opens up the space and realizes highly desirable high modulus–low density and high modulus–high damping material structures."
97,Deterministic inverse design of Tamm plasmon thermal emitters with multi-resonant control,2021-10-21,"Wavelength-selective thermal emitters (WS-EMs) are of interest due to the lack of cost-effective, narrow-band sources in the mid- to long-wave infrared. WS-EMs can be realized via Tamm plasmon polaritons (TPPs) supported by distributed Bragg reflectors on metals. However, the design of multiple resonances is challenging as numerous structural parameters must be optimized simultaneously. Here we use stochastic gradient descent to optimize TPP emitters (TPP-EMs) composed of an aperiodic distributed Bragg reflector deposited on doped cadmium oxide (CdO) film, where layer thicknesses and carrier density are inversely designed. The combination of the aperiodic distributed Bragg reflector with the designable plasma frequency of CdO enables multiple TPP-EM modes to be simultaneously designed with arbitrary spectral control not accessible with metal-based TPPs. Using this approach, we experimentally demonstrated and numerically proposed TPP-EMs exhibiting single or multiple emission bands with designable frequencies, line-widths and amplitudes. This thereby enables lithography-free, wafer-scale WS-EMs that are complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor compatible for applications such as free-space communications and gas sensing."
98,Microtubules tune mechanosensitive cell responses,2021-10-18,"Mechanotransduction is a process by which cells sense the mechanical properties of their surrounding environment and adapt accordingly to perform cellular functions such as adhesion, migration and differentiation. Integrin-mediated focal adhesions are major sites of mechanotransduction and their connection with the actomyosin network is crucial for mechanosensing as well as for the generation and transmission of forces onto the substrate. Despite having emerged as major regulators of cell adhesion and migration, the contribution of microtubules to mechanotransduction still remains elusive. Here, we show that talin- and actomyosin-dependent mechanosensing of substrate rigidity controls microtubule acetylation (a tubulin post-translational modification) by promoting the recruitment of α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (αTAT1) to focal adhesions. Microtubule acetylation tunes the mechanosensitivity of focal adhesions and Yes-associated protein (YAP) translocation. Microtubule acetylation, in turn, promotes the release of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1 from microtubules to activate RhoA, actomyosin contractility and traction forces. Our results reveal a fundamental crosstalk between microtubules and actin in mechanotransduction that contributes to mechanosensitive cell adhesion and migration."
99,Three-dimensional atomic packing in amorphous solids with liquid-like structure,2021-10-18,"Liquids and solids are two fundamental states of matter. However, our understanding of their three-dimensional atomic structure is mostly based on physical models. Here we use atomic electron tomography to experimentally determine the three-dimensional atomic positions of monatomic amorphous solids, namely a Ta thin film and two Pd nanoparticles. We observe that pentagonal bipyramids are the most abundant atomic motifs in these amorphous materials. Instead of forming icosahedra, the majority of pentagonal bipyramids arrange into pentagonal bipyramid networks with medium-range order. Molecular dynamics simulations further reveal that pentagonal bipyramid networks are prevalent in monatomic metallic liquids, which rapidly grow in size and form more icosahedra during the quench from the liquid to the glass state. These results expand our understanding of the atomic structures of amorphous solids and will encourage future studies on amorphous–crystalline phase and glass transitions in non-crystalline materials with three-dimensional atomic resolution."
100,Solvent-free autocatalytic supramolecular polymerization,2021-10-14,"Solvent-free chemical manufacturing is one of the awaited technologies for addressing an emergent issue of environmental pollution. Here, we report solvent-free autocatalytic supramolecular polymerization (SF-ASP), which provides an inhibition-free template-assisted catalytic organic transformation that takes great advantage of the fact that the product (template) undergoes a termination-free nucleation–elongation assembly (living supramolecular polymerization) under solvent-free conditions. SF-ASP allows for reductive cyclotetramerization of hydrogen-bonding phthalonitriles into the corresponding phthalocyanines in exceptionally high yields (>80%). SF-ASP requires the growing polymer to form hexagonally packed crystalline fibres, which possibly preorganize the phthalonitriles at their cross-sectional edges for their efficient transformation. With metal oleates, SF-ASP produces single-crystalline fibres of metallophthalocyanines again in exceptionally high yields, which grow in both directions without terminal coupling until the phthalonitrile precursors are completely consumed. By taking advantage of this living nature of polymerization, multistep SF-ASP without/with metal oleates allows for the precision synthesis of multi-block supramolecular copolymers."
101,3D-printed silica with nanoscale resolution,2021-10-14,"Fabricating inorganic materials with designed three-dimensional nanostructures is an exciting yet challenging area of research and industrial application. Here, we develop an approach to 3D print high-quality nanostructures of silica with sub-200 nm resolution and with the flexible capability of rare-earth element doping. The printed SiO2 can be either amorphous glass or polycrystalline cristobalite controlled by the sintering process. The 3D-printed nanostructures demonstrate attractive optical properties. For instance, the fabricated micro-toroid optical resonators can reach quality factors (Q) of over 104. Moreover, and importantly for optical applications, doping and codoping of rare-earth salts such as Er3+, Tm3+, Yb3+, Eu3+ and Nd3+ can be directly implemented in the printed SiO2 structures, showing strong photoluminescence at the desired wavelengths. This technique shows the potential for building integrated microphotonics with silica via 3D printing."
102,Atomistic observation on diffusion-mediated friction between single-asperity contacts,2021-10-07,"The field of nanotribology has long suffered from the inability to directly observe what takes place at a sliding interface. Although techniques based on atomic force microscopy have identified many friction phenomena at the nanoscale, many interpretative pitfalls still result from the indirect or ex situ characterization of contacting surfaces. Here we combined in situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements to provide direct real-time observations of atomic-scale interfacial structure during frictional processes and discovered the formation of a loosely packed interfacial layer between two metallic asperities that enabled a low friction under tensile stress. This finding is corroborated by molecular dynamic simulations. The loosely packed interfacial layer became an ordered layer at equilibrium distances under compressive stress, which led to a transition from a low-friction to a dissipative high-friction motion. This work directly unveils a unique role of atomic diffusion in the friction of metallic contacts."
103,Sign-tunable anomalous Hall effect induced by two-dimensional symmetry-protected nodal structures in ferromagnetic perovskite thin films,2021-10-04,"Magnetism and spin–orbit coupling are two quintessential ingredients underlying topological transport phenomena in itinerant ferromagnets. When spin-polarized bands support nodal points/lines with band degeneracy that can be lifted by spin–orbit coupling, the nodal structures become a source of Berry curvature, leading to a large anomalous Hall effect. However, two-dimensional systems can possess stable nodal structures only when proper crystalline symmetry exists. Here we show that two-dimensional spin-polarized band structures of perovskite oxides generally support symmetry-protected nodal lines and points that govern both the sign and the magnitude of the anomalous Hall effect. To demonstrate this, we performed angle-resolved photoemission studies of ultrathin films of SrRuO3, a representative metallic ferromagnet with spin–orbit coupling. We show that the sign-changing anomalous Hall effect upon variation in the film thickness, magnetization and chemical potential can be well explained by theoretical models. Our work may facilitate new switchable devices based on ferromagnetic ultrathin films."
104, reservoir computing with a fully memristive architecture based on self-organizing nanowire networks,2021-10-04,"Neuromorphic computing aims at the realization of intelligent systems able to process information similarly to our brain. Brain-inspired computing paradigms have been implemented in crossbar arrays of memristive devices; however, this approach does not emulate the topology and the emergent behaviour of biological neuronal circuits, where the principle of self-organization regulates both structure and function. Here, we report on in materia reservoir computing in a fully memristive architecture based on self-organized nanowire networks. Thanks to the functional synaptic connectivity with nonlinear dynamics and fading memory properties, the designless nanowire complex network acts as a network-wide physical reservoir able to map spatio-temporal inputs into a feature space that can be analysed by a memristive resistive switching memory read-out layer. Computing capabilities, including recognition of spatio-temporal patterns and time-series prediction, show that the emergent memristive behaviour of nanowire networks allows in materia implementation of brain-inspired computing paradigms characterized by a reduced training cost."
105,Enhanced superconductivity and ferroelectric quantum criticality in plastically deformed strontium titanate,2021-10-04,"The properties of quantum materials are commonly tuned using experimental variables such as pressure, magnetic field and doping. Here we explore a different approach using irreversible, plastic deformation of single crystals. We show that compressive plastic deformation induces low-dimensional superconductivity well above the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of undeformed SrTiO3, with evidence of possible superconducting correlations at temperatures two orders of magnitude above the bulk Tc. The enhanced superconductivity is correlated with the appearance of self-organized dislocation structures, as revealed by diffuse neutron and X-ray scattering. We also observe deformation-induced signatures of quantum-critical ferroelectric fluctuations and inhomogeneous ferroelectric order using Raman scattering. Our results suggest that strain surrounding the self-organized dislocation structures induces local ferroelectricity and quantum-critical dynamics that strongly influence Tc, consistent with a theory of superconductivity enhanced by soft polar fluctuations. Our results demonstrate the potential of plastic deformation and dislocation engineering for the manipulation of electronic properties of quantum materials."
106,Giant magnetoelastic effect in soft systems for bioelectronics,2021-09-30,"The magnetoelastic effect—the variation of the magnetic properties of a material under mechanical stress—is usually observed in rigid alloys, whose mechanical modulus is significantly different from that of human tissues, thus limiting their use in bioelectronics applications. Here, we observed a giant magnetoelastic effect in a soft system based on micromagnets dispersed in a silicone matrix, reaching a magnetomechanical coupling factor indicating up to four times more enhancement than in rigid counterparts. The results are interpreted using a wavy chain model, showing how mechanical stress changes the micromagnets’ spacing and dipole alignment, thus altering the magnetic field generated by the composite. Combined with liquid-metal coils patterned on polydimethylsiloxane working as a magnetic induction layer, the soft magnetoelastic composite is used for stretchable and water-resistant magnetoelastic generators adhering conformably to human skin. Such devices can be used as wearable or implantable power generators and biomedical sensors, opening alternative avenues for human-body-centred applications."
107,Electrorefining for direct decarburization of molten iron,2021-09-27,"Recycling iron and steel is critical for environmental sustainability and essential to close material loops in circular economics. A major challenge is to produce high-value products and to control impurities like carbon in the face of stringent consumer requirements and volatile markets. Here, we develop an electrorefining process that directly decarburizes molten iron by imposing an electromotive force between it and a slag electrolyte. Upon anodic polarization, oxide anions from the slag discharge directly on carbon dissolved in molten iron, evolving gaseous carbon monoxide. In a striking departure from conventional practice that highly relies on reaction with solubilized oxygen, here electrorefining achieves decarburization by direct interfacial reaction. We demonstrate that this technique produces ultra-low-carbon steels and recovers silicon as a by-product at the cathode, requiring a low energy input and no reagents. We expect this process to be scalable and integrable with secondary steel mills."
108,Anisotropic epitaxial stabilization of a low-symmetry ferroelectric with enhanced electromechanical response,2021-09-23,"Piezoelectrics interconvert mechanical energy and electric charge and are widely used in actuators and sensors. The best performing materials are ferroelectrics at a morphotropic phase boundary, where several phases coexist. Switching between these phases by electric field produces a large electromechanical response. In ferroelectric BiFeO3, strain can create a morphotropic-phase-boundary-like phase mixture and thus generate large electric-field-dependent strains. However, this enhanced response occurs at localized, randomly positioned regions of the film. Here, we use epitaxial strain and orientation engineering in tandem—anisotropic epitaxy—to craft a low-symmetry phase of BiFeO3 that acts as a structural bridge between the rhombohedral-like and tetragonal-like polymorphs. Interferometric displacement sensor measurements reveal that this phase has an enhanced piezoelectric coefficient of ×2.4 compared with typical rhombohedral-like BiFeO3. Band-excitation frequency response measurements and first-principles calculations provide evidence that this phase undergoes a transition to the tetragonal-like polymorph under electric field, generating an enhanced piezoelectric response throughout the film and associated field-induced reversible strains. These results offer a route to engineer thin-film piezoelectrics with improved functionalities, with broader perspectives for other functional oxides."
109,Correlative cryo-ET identifies actin/tropomyosin filaments that mediate cell–substrate adhesion in cancer cells and mechanosensitivity of cell proliferation,2021-09-13,"The actin cytoskeleton is the primary driver of cellular adhesion and mechanosensing due to its ability to generate force and sense the stiffness of the environment. At the cell’s leading edge, severing of the protruding Arp2/3 actin network generates a specific actin/tropomyosin (Tpm) filament population that controls lamellipodial persistence. The interaction between these filaments and adhesion to the environment is unknown. Using cellular cryo-electron tomography we resolve the ultrastructure of the Tpm/actin copolymers and show that they specifically anchor to nascent adhesions and are essential for focal adhesion assembly. Re-expression of Tpm1.8/1.9 in transformed and cancer cells is sufficient to restore cell–substrate adhesions. We demonstrate that knock-out of Tpm1.8/1.9 disrupts the formation of dorsal actin bundles, hindering the recruitment of α-actinin and non-muscle myosin IIa, critical mechanosensors. This loss causes a force-generation and proliferation defect that is notably reversed when cells are grown on soft surfaces. We conclude that Tpm1.8/1.9 suppress the metastatic phenotype, which may explain why transformed cells naturally downregulate this Tpm subset during malignant transformation."
110,A microenvironment-inspired synthetic three-dimensional model for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma organoids,2021-09-13,"Experimental in vitro models that capture pathophysiological characteristics of human tumours are essential for basic and translational cancer biology. Here, we describe a fully synthetic hydrogel extracellular matrix designed to elicit key phenotypic traits of the pancreatic environment in culture. To enable the growth of normal and cancerous pancreatic organoids from genetically engineered murine models and human patients, essential adhesive cues were empirically defined and replicated in the hydrogel scaffold, revealing a functional role of laminin–integrin α3/α6 signalling in establishment and survival of pancreatic organoids. Altered tissue stiffness—a hallmark of pancreatic cancer—was recapitulated in culture by adjusting the hydrogel properties to engage mechano-sensing pathways and alter organoid growth. Pancreatic stromal cells were readily incorporated into the hydrogels and replicated phenotypic traits characteristic of the tumour environment in vivo. This model therefore recapitulates a pathologically remodelled tumour microenvironment for studies of normal and pancreatic cancer cells in vitro."
111,Two-dimensional hole gas in organic semiconductors,2021-09-06,"A highly conductive metallic gas that is quantum mechanically confined at a solid-state interface is an ideal platform to explore non-trivial electronic states that are otherwise inaccessible in bulk materials. Although two-dimensional electron gases have been realized in conventional semiconductor interfaces, examples of two-dimensional hole gases, the counterpart to the two-dimensional electron gas, are still limited. Here we report the observation of a two-dimensional hole gas in solution-processed organic semiconductors in conjunction with an electric double layer using ionic liquids. A molecularly flat single crystal of high-mobility organic semiconductors serves as a defect-free interface that facilitates two-dimensional confinement of high-density holes. A remarkably low sheet resistance of 6 kΩ and high hole-gas density of 1014 cm−2 result in a metal–insulator transition at ambient pressure. The measured degenerate holes in the organic semiconductors provide an opportunity to tailor low-dimensional electronic states using molecularly engineered heterointerfaces."
112,Site-specific chemical doping reveals electron atmospheres at the surfaces of organic semiconductor crystals,2021-08-30,"Chemical doping controls the electronic properties of organic semiconductors, but so far, doping protocols and mechanisms are less developed than in conventional semiconductors. Here we describe a unique, site-specific, n-type surface doping mechanism for single crystals of two benchmark organic semiconductors that produces dramatic improvement in electron transport and provides unprecedented evidence for doping-induced space charge. The surface doping chemistry specifically targets crystallographic step edges, which are known electron traps, simultaneously passivating the traps and releasing itinerant electrons. The effect on electron transport is profound: field-effect electron mobility increases by as much as a factor of ten, and its temperature-dependent behaviour switches from thermally activated to band-like. Our findings suggest new site-specific strategies to dope organic semiconductors that differ from the conventional redox chemistry of randomly distributed substitutional impurities. Critically, they also verify the presence of doping-induced electron atmospheres, confirming long-standing expectations for organic systems from conventional solid-state theory."
113,The transport–structural correspondence across the nematic phase transition probed by elasto X-ray diffraction,2021-08-26,"Electronic nematicity in iron pnictide materials is coupled to both the lattice and the conducting electrons, which allows both structural and transport observables to probe nematic fluctuations and the order parameter. Here we combine simultaneous transport and X-ray diffraction measurements with in-situ tunable strain (elasto X-ray diffraction) to measure the temperature dependence of the shear modulus and elastoresistivity above the nematic transition and the spontaneous orthorhombicity and resistivity anisotropy below the nematic transition, all within a single sample of Ba(Fe0.96Co0.04)2As2. The ratio of transport to structural quantities is nearly temperature independent over a 74 K range and agrees between the ordered and disordered phases. These results show that elasto X-ray diffraction is a powerful technique to probe the nemato-elastic and nemato-transport couplings, which have important implications to the nearby superconductivity. It also enables the measurement in the large strain limit, where the breakdown of the mean-field description reveals the intertwined nature of nematicity."
114,Ion exchange in atomically thin clays and micas,2021-08-26,"The physical properties of clays and micas can be controlled by exchanging ions in the crystal lattice. Atomically thin materials can have superior properties in a range of membrane applications, yet the ion-exchange process itself remains largely unexplored in few-layer crystals. Here we use atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy to study the dynamics of ion exchange and reveal individual ion binding sites in atomically thin and artificially restacked clays and micas. We find that the ion diffusion coefficient for the interlayer space of atomically thin samples is up to 104 times larger than in bulk crystals and approaches its value in free water. Samples where no bulk exchange is expected display fast exchange at restacked interfaces, where the exchanged ions arrange in islands with dimensions controlled by the moiré superlattice dimensions. We attribute the fast ion diffusion to enhanced interlayer expandability resulting from weaker interlayer binding forces in both atomically thin and restacked materials. This work provides atomic scale insights into ion diffusion in highly confined spaces and suggests strategies to design exfoliated clay membranes with enhanced performance."
115,Confining isolated chromophores for highly efficient blue phosphorescence,2021-08-23,"High-efficiency blue phosphorescence emission is essential for organic optoelectronic applications. However, synthesizing heavy-atom-free organic systems having high triplet energy levels and suppressed non-radiative transitions—key requirements for efficient blue phosphorescence—has proved difficult. Here we demonstrate a simple chemical strategy for achieving high-performance blue phosphors, based on confining isolated chromophores in ionic crystals. Formation of high-density ionic bonds between the cations of ionic crystals and the carboxylic acid groups of the chromophores leads to a segregated molecular arrangement with negligible inter-chromophore interactions. We show that tunable phosphorescence from blue to deep blue with a maximum phosphorescence efficiency of 96.5% can be achieved by varying the charged chromophores and their counterions. Moreover, these phosphorescent materials enable rapid, high-throughput data encryption, fingerprint identification and afterglow display. This work will facilitate the design of high-efficiency blue organic phosphors and extend the domain of organic phosphorescence to new applications."
116,Weyl-mediated helical magnetism in NdAlSi,2021-08-19,"Emergent relativistic quasiparticles in Weyl semimetals are the source of exotic electronic properties such as surface Fermi arcs, the anomalous Hall effect and negative magnetoresistance, all observed in real materials. Whereas these phenomena highlight the effect of Weyl fermions on the electronic transport properties, less is known about what collective phenomena they may support. Here, we report a Weyl semimetal, NdAlSi, that offers an example. Using neutron diffraction, we found a long-wavelength helical magnetic order in NdAlSi, the periodicity of which is linked to the nesting vector between two topologically non-trivial Fermi pockets, which we characterize using density functional theory and quantum oscillation measurements. We further show the chiral transverse component of the spin structure is promoted by bond-oriented Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interactions associated with Weyl exchange processes. Our work provides a rare example of Weyl fermions driving collective magnetism."
117,UItra-low friction and edge-pinning effect in large-lattice-mismatch van der Waals heterostructures,2021-08-05,"Two-dimensional heterostructures are excellent platforms to realize twist-angle-independent ultra-low friction due to their weak interlayer van der Waals interactions and natural lattice mismatch. However, for finite-size interfaces, the effect of domain edges on the friction process remains unclear. Here we report the superlubricity phenomenon and the edge-pinning effect at MoS2/graphite and MoS2/hexagonal boron nitride van der Waals heterostructure interfaces. We found that the friction coefficients of these heterostructures are below 10−6. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate the experiments, which highlights the contribution of edges and interface steps to friction forces. Our experiments and simulations provide more information on the sliding mechanism of finite low-dimensional structures, which is vital to understand the friction process of laminar solid lubricants."
118,Effects of interlayer confinement and hydration on capacitive charge storage in birnessite,2021-08-02,"Nanostructured birnessite exhibits high specific capacitance and nearly ideal capacitive behaviour in aqueous electrolytes, rendering it an important electrode material for low-cost, high-power energy storage devices. The mechanism of electrochemical capacitance in birnessite has been described as both Faradaic (involving redox) and non-Faradaic (involving only electrostatic interactions). To clarify the capacitive mechanism, we characterized birnessite’s response to applied potential using ex situ X-ray diffraction, electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance, in situ Raman spectroscopy and operando atomic force microscope dilatometry to provide a holistic understanding of its structural, gravimetric and mechanical responses. These observations are supported by atomic-scale simulations using density functional theory for the cation-intercalated structure of birnessite, ReaxFF reactive force field-based molecular dynamics and ReaxFF-based grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations on the dynamics at the birnessite–water–electrolyte interface. We show that capacitive charge storage in birnessite is governed by interlayer cation intercalation. We conclude that the intercalation appears capacitive due to the presence of nanoconfined interlayer structural water, which mediates the interaction between the intercalated cation and the birnessite host and leads to minimal structural changes."
119,Polycrystalline SnSe with a thermoelectric figure of merit greater than the single crystal,2021-08-02,"Thermoelectric materials generate electric energy from waste heat, with conversion efficiency governed by the dimensionless figure of merit, ZT. Single-crystal tin selenide (SnSe) was discovered to exhibit a high ZT of roughly 2.2–2.6 at 913 K, but more practical and deployable polycrystal versions of the same compound suffer from much poorer overall ZT, thereby thwarting prospects for cost-effective lead-free thermoelectrics. The poor polycrystal bulk performance is attributed to traces of tin oxides covering the surface of SnSe powders, which increases thermal conductivity, reduces electrical conductivity and thereby reduces ZT. Here, we report that hole-doped SnSe polycrystalline samples with reagents carefully purified and tin oxides removed exhibit an ZT of roughly 3.1 at 783 K. Its lattice thermal conductivity is ultralow at roughly 0.07 W m–1 K–1 at 783 K, lower than the single crystals. The path to ultrahigh thermoelectric performance in polycrystalline samples is the proper removal of the deleterious thermally conductive oxides from the surface of SnSe grains. These results could open an era of high-performance practical thermoelectrics from this high-performance material."
120,Photocurable bioresorbable adhesives as functional interfaces between flexible bioelectronic devices and soft biological tissues,2021-07-29,"Flexible electronic/optoelectronic systems that can intimately integrate onto the surfaces of vital organ systems have the potential to offer revolutionary diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities relevant to a wide spectrum of diseases and disorders. The critical interfaces between such technologies and living tissues must provide soft mechanical coupling and efficient optical/electrical/chemical exchange. Here, we introduce a functional adhesive bioelectronic–tissue interface material, in the forms of mechanically compliant, electrically conductive, and optically transparent encapsulating coatings, interfacial layers or supporting matrices. These materials strongly bond both to the surfaces of the devices and to those of different internal organs, with stable adhesion for several days to months, in chemistries that can be tailored to bioresorb at controlled rates. Experimental demonstrations in live animal models include device applications that range from battery-free optoelectronic systems for deep-brain optogenetics and subdermal phototherapy to wireless millimetre-scale pacemakers and flexible multielectrode epicardial arrays. These advances have immediate applicability across nearly all types of bioelectronic/optoelectronic system currently used in animal model studies, and they also have the potential for future treatment of life-threatening diseases and disorders in humans."
121,A hybrid erbium(III)–bacteriochlorin near-infrared probe for multiplexed biomedical imaging,2021-07-29,"Spectrally distinct fluorophores are desired for multiplexed bioimaging. In particular, monitoring biological processes in living mammals needs fluorophores that operate in the ‘tissue-transparent’ near-infrared (NIR) window, that is, between 700 and 1,700 nm. Here we report a fluorophore system based on molecular erbium(III)–bacteriochlorin complexes with large Stokes shift (>750 nm) and narrowband NIR-to-NIR downconversion spectra (full-width at half-maximum ≤ 32 nm). We have found that the fast (2 × 109 s–¹) and near-unity energy transfer from bacteriochlorin triplets to the erbium(III) 4I13/2 level overcomes the notorious vibrational overtones quenching, resulting in bright and long-lived (1.73 μs) 1,530 nm luminescence in water. We demonstrate the excitation/emission-multiplexed capability of the complexes in the visualization of dynamic circulatory and metabolic processes in living mice, and through skull tracking of cancer cell metastases in mouse brain. This hybrid probe system facilitates robust multiplexed NIR imaging with high contrast and spatial resolution for applications ranging from fluorescence-guided surgery, diagnostics and intravital microscopy."
122,Extending insertion electrochemistry to soluble layered halides with superconcentrated electrolytes,2021-07-29,"Insertion compounds provide the fundamental basis of today’s commercialized Li-ion batteries. Throughout history, intense research has focused on the design of stellar electrodes mainly relying on layered oxides or sulfides, and leaving aside the corresponding halides because of solubility issues. This is no longer true. In this work, we show the feasibility of reversibly intercalating Li+ electrochemically into VX3 compounds (X = Cl, Br, I) via the use of superconcentrated electrolytes (5 M LiFSI in dimethyl carbonate), hence opening access to a family of LixVX3 phases. Moreover, through an electrolyte engineering approach, we unambiguously prove that the positive attribute of superconcentrated electrolytes against the solubility of inorganic compounds is rooted in a thermodynamic rather than a kinetic effect. The mechanism and corresponding impact of our findings enrich the fundamental understanding of superconcentrated electrolytes and constitute a crucial step in the design of novel insertion compounds with tunable properties for a wide range of applications including Li-ion batteries and beyond."
123,Interlayer electronic coupling on demand in a 2D magnetic semiconductor,2021-07-26,"When monolayers of two-dimensional (2D) materials are stacked into van der Waals structures, interlayer electronic coupling can introduce entirely new properties, as exemplified by recent discoveries of moiré bands that host highly correlated electronic states and quantum dot-like interlayer exciton lattices. Here we show the magnetic control of interlayer electronic coupling, as manifested in tunable excitonic transitions, in an A-type antiferromagnetic 2D semiconductor CrSBr. Excitonic transitions in bilayers and above can be drastically changed when the magnetic order is switched from the layered antiferromagnetic ground state to a field-induced ferromagnetic state, an effect attributed to the spin-allowed interlayer hybridization of electron and hole orbitals in the latter, as revealed by Green’s function–Bethe–Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) calculations. Our work uncovers a magnetic approach to engineer electronic and excitonic effects in layered magnetic semiconductors."
124,Hydrophilicity gradient in covalent organic frameworks for membrane distillation,2021-07-22,"Desalination can help to alleviate the fresh-water crisis facing the world. Thermally driven membrane distillation is a promising way to purify water from a variety of saline and polluted sources by utilizing low-grade heat. However, membrane distillation membranes suffer from limited permeance and wetting owing to the lack of precise structural control. Here, we report a strategy to fabricate membrane distillation membranes composed of vertically aligned channels with a hydrophilicity gradient by engineering defects in covalent organic framework films by the removal of imine bonds. Such functional variation in individual channels enables a selective water transport pathway and a precise liquid–vapour phase change interface. In addition to having anti-fouling and anti-wetting capability, the covalent organic framework membrane on a supporting layer shows a flux of 600 l m–2 h–1 with 85 °C feed at 16 kPa absolute pressure, which is nearly triple that of the state-of-the-art membrane distillation membrane for desalination. Our results may promote the development of gradient membranes for molecular sieving."
125,A two-dimensional type I superionic conductor,2021-07-22,"Superionic conductors possess liquid-like ionic diffusivity in the solid state, finding wide applicability from electrolytes in energy storage to materials for thermoelectric energy conversion. Type I superionic conductors (for example, AgI, Ag2Se and so on) are defined by a first-order transition to the superionic state and have so far been found exclusively in three-dimensional crystal structures. Here, we reveal a two-dimensional type I superionic conductor, α-KAg3Se2, by scattering techniques and complementary simulations. Quasi-elastic neutron scattering and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the superionic Ag+ ions are confined to subnanometre sheets, with the simulated local structure validated by experimental X-ray powder pair-distribution-function analysis. Finally, we demonstrate that the phase transition temperature can be controlled by chemical substitution of the alkali metal ions that compose the immobile charge-balancing layers. Our work thus extends the known classes of superionic conductors and will facilitate the design of new materials with tailored ionic conductivities and phase transitions."
126,Microenvironment-triggered multimodal precision diagnostics,2021-07-15,"Therapeutic outcomes in oncology may be aided by precision diagnostics that offer early detection, localization and the opportunity to monitor response to therapy. Here, we report a multimodal nanosensor engineered to target tumours through acidosis, respond to proteases in the microenvironment to release urinary reporters and (optionally) carry positron emission tomography probes to enable localization of primary and metastatic cancers in mouse models of colorectal cancer. We present a paradigm wherein this multimodal sensor can be employed longitudinally to assess burden of disease non-invasively, including tumour progression and response to chemotherapy. Specifically, we showed that acidosis-mediated tumour insertion enhanced on-target release of matrix metalloproteinase-responsive reporters in urine. Subsequent on-demand loading of the radiotracer 64Cu allowed pH-dependent tumour visualization, enabling enriched microenvironmental characterization when compared with the conventional metabolic tracer 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. Through tailored target specificities, this modular platform has the capacity to be engineered as a pan-cancer test that may guide treatment decisions for numerous tumour types."
127,Chemical heterogeneity enhances hydrogen resistance in high-strength steels,2021-07-08,"The antagonism between strength and resistance to hydrogen embrittlement in metallic materials is an intrinsic obstacle to the design of lightweight yet reliable structural components operated in hydrogen-containing environments. Economical and scalable microstructural solutions to this challenge must be found. Here, we introduce a counterintuitive strategy to exploit the typically undesired chemical heterogeneity within the material’s microstructure that enables local enhancement of crack resistance and local hydrogen trapping. We use this approach in a manganese-containing high-strength steel and produce a high dispersion of manganese-rich zones within the microstructure. These solute-rich buffer regions allow for local micro-tuning of the phase stability, arresting hydrogen-induced microcracks and thus interrupting the percolation of hydrogen-assisted damage. This results in a superior hydrogen embrittlement resistance (better by a factor of two) without sacrificing the material’s strength and ductility. The strategy of exploiting chemical heterogeneities, rather than avoiding them, broadens the horizon for microstructure engineering via advanced thermomechanical processing."
128,Achieving adjustable elasticity with non-affine to affine transition,2021-07-01,"For various engineering and industrial applications it is desirable to realize mechanical systems with broadly adjustable elasticity to respond flexibly to the external environment. Here we discover a topology-correlated transition between affine and non-affine regimes in elasticity in both two- and three-dimensional packing-derived networks. Based on this transition, we numerically design and experimentally realize multifunctional systems with adjustable elasticity. Within one system, we achieve solid-like affine response, liquid-like non-affine response and a continuous tunability in between. Moreover, the system also exhibits a broadly tunable Poisson’s ratio from positive to negative values, which is of practical interest for energy absorption and for fracture-resistant materials. Our study reveals a fundamental connection between elasticity and network topology, and demonstrates its practical potential for designing mechanical systems and metamaterials."
129,Computational prediction of the molecular configuration of three-dimensional network polymers,2021-06-28,"The three-dimensional arrangement of natural and synthetic network materials determines their application range. Control over the real-time incorporation of each building block and functional group is desired to regulate the macroscopic properties of the material from the molecular level onwards. Here we report an approach combining kinetic Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations that chemically and physically predicts the interactions between building blocks in time and in space for the entire formation process of three-dimensional networks. This framework takes into account variations in inter- and intramolecular chemical reactivity, diffusivity, segmental compositions, branch/network point locations and defects. From the kinetic and three-dimensional structural information gathered, we construct structure–property relationships based on molecular descriptors such as pore size or dangling chain distribution and differentiate ideal from non-ideal structural elements. We validate such relationships by synthesizing organosilica, epoxy–amine and Diels–Alder networks with tailored properties and functions, further demonstrating the broad applicability of the platform."
130,Supersonic impact resilience of nanoarchitected carbon,2021-06-24,"Architected materials with nanoscale features have enabled extreme combinations of properties by exploiting the ultralightweight structural design space together with size-induced mechanical enhancement at small scales. Apart from linear waves in metamaterials, this principle has been restricted to quasi-static properties or to low-speed phenomena, leaving nanoarchitected materials under extreme dynamic conditions largely unexplored. Here, using supersonic microparticle impact experiments, we demonstrate extreme impact energy dissipation in three-dimensional nanoarchitected carbon materials that exhibit mass-normalized energy dissipation superior to that of traditional impact-resistant materials such as steel, aluminium, polymethyl methacrylate and Kevlar. In-situ ultrahigh-speed imaging and post-mortem confocal microscopy reveal consistent mechanisms such as compaction cratering and microparticle capture that enable this superior response. By analogy to planetary impact, we introduce predictive tools for crater formation in these materials using dimensional analysis. These results substantially uncover the dynamic regime over which nanoarchitecture enables the design of ultralightweight, impact-resistant materials that could open the way to design principles for lightweight armour, protective coatings and blast-resistant shields for sensitive electronics."
131,Centimetre-scale crack-free self-assembly for ultra-high tensile strength metallic nanolattices,2021-06-17,"Nanolattices exhibit attractive mechanical, energy conversion and optical properties, but it is challenging to fabricate large nanolattices while maintaining the dense regular nanometre features that enable their properties. Here we report a crack-free self-assembly approach for fabricating centimetre-scale nickel nanolattices with much larger crack-free areas than prior self-assembled nanolattices and many more unit cells than three-dimensionally printed nanolattices. These nickel nanolattices have a feature size of 100 nm, a grain size of 30 nm and a tensile strength of 260 MPa, which approaches the theoretical strength limit for porous nickel. The self-assembly method and porous metal mechanics reported in this work may advance the fabrication and applications of high-strength multifunctional porous materials."
132,Programmable icosahedral shell system for virus trapping,2021-06-14,"Broad-spectrum antiviral platforms that can decrease or inhibit viral infection would alleviate many threats to global public health. Nonetheless, effective technologies of this kind are still not available. Here, we describe a programmable icosahedral canvas for the self-assembly of icosahedral shells that have viral trapping and antiviral properties. Programmable triangular building blocks constructed from DNA assemble with high yield into various shell objects with user-defined geometries and apertures. We have created shells with molecular masses ranging from 43 to 925 MDa (8 to 180 subunits) and with internal cavity diameters of up to 280 nm. The shell interior can be functionalized with virus-specific moieties in a modular fashion. We demonstrate this virus-trapping concept by engulfing hepatitis B virus core particles and adeno-associated viruses. We demonstrate the inhibition of hepatitis B virus core interactions with surfaces in vitro and the neutralization of infectious adeno-associated viruses exposed to human cells."
133,Chemical vapour deposition of Fe–N–C oxygen reduction catalysts with full utilization of dense Fe–N,2021-06-10,"Replacing scarce and expensive platinum (Pt) with metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–N–C) catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction in proton exchange membrane fuel cells has largely been impeded by the low oxygen reduction reaction activity of M–N–C due to low active site density and site utilization. Herein, we overcome these limits by implementing chemical vapour deposition to synthesize Fe–N–C by flowing iron chloride vapour over a Zn–N–C substrate at 750 °C, leading to high-temperature trans-metalation of Zn–N4 sites into Fe–N4 sites. Characterization by multiple techniques shows that all Fe–N4 sites formed via this approach are gas-phase and electrochemically accessible. As a result, the Fe–N–C catalyst has an active site density of 1.92 × 1020 sites per gram with 100% site utilization. This catalyst delivers an unprecedented oxygen reduction reaction activity of 33 mA cm−2 at 0.90 V (iR-corrected; i, current; R, resistance) in a H2–O2 proton exchange membrane fuel cell at 1.0 bar and 80 °C."
134,Random access DNA memory using Boolean search in an archival file storage system,2021-06-10,"DNA is an ultrahigh-density storage medium that could meet exponentially growing worldwide demand for archival data storage if DNA synthesis costs declined sufficiently and if random access of files within exabyte-to-yottabyte-scale DNA data pools were feasible. Here, we demonstrate a path to overcome the second barrier by encapsulating data-encoding DNA file sequences within impervious silica capsules that are surface labelled with single-stranded DNA barcodes. Barcodes are chosen to represent file metadata, enabling selection of sets of files with Boolean logic directly, without use of amplification. We demonstrate random access of image files from a prototypical 2-kilobyte image database using fluorescence sorting with selection sensitivity of one in 106 files, which thereby enables one in 106N selection capability using N optical channels. Our strategy thereby offers a scalable concept for random access of archival files in large-scale molecular datasets."
135,Band gap engineering in blended organic semiconductor films based on dielectric interactions,2021-06-10,"Blending organic molecules to tune their energy levels is currently being investigated as an approach to engineer the bulk and interfacial optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors. It has been proven that the ionization energy and electron affinity can be equally shifted in the same direction by electrostatic effects controlled by blending similar halogenated derivatives with different energetics. Here we show that the energy gap of organic semiconductors can also be tuned by blending. We use oligothiophenes with different numbers of thiophene rings as an example and investigate their structure and electronic properties. Photoelectron spectroscopy and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy show tunability of the single-particle gap, with the optical gaps showing similar, but smaller, effects. Theoretical analysis shows that this tuning is mainly caused by a change in the dielectric constant with blend ratio. Further studies will explore the practical impact of this energy-level engineering strategy for optoelectronic devices."
136,Thermal chiral anomaly in the magnetic-field-induced ideal Weyl phase of Bi,2021-06-07,"The chiral anomaly is the predicted breakdown of chiral symmetry in a Weyl semimetal with monopoles of opposite chirality when an electric field is applied parallel to a magnetic field. It occurs because of charge pumping between monopoles of opposite chirality. Experimental observation of this fundamental effect is plagued by concerns about the current pathways. Here we demonstrate the thermal chiral anomaly, energy pumping between monopoles, in topological insulator bismuth–antimony alloys driven into an ideal Weyl semimetal state by a Zeeman field, with the chemical potential pinned at the Weyl points and in the absence of any trivial Fermi surface pockets. The experimental signature is a large enhancement of the thermal conductivity in an applied magnetic field parallel to the thermal gradient. This work demonstrates both pumping of energy and charge between the two Weyl points of opposite chirality and that they are related by the Wiedemann–Franz law."
137,Synthetic Rashba spin–orbit system using a silicon metal-oxide semiconductor,2021-06-03,"The spin–orbit interaction (SOI), mainly manifesting itself in heavy elements and compound materials, has been attracting much attention as a means of manipulating and/or converting a spin degree of freedom. Here, we show that a Si metal-oxide- semiconductor (MOS) heterostructure possesses Rashba-type SOI, although Si is a light element and has lattice inversion symmetry resulting in inherently negligible SOI in bulk form. When a strong gate electric field is applied to the Si MOS, we observe spin lifetime anisotropy of propagating spins in the Si through the formation of an emergent effective magnetic field due to the SOI. Furthermore, the Rashba parameter α in the system increases linearly up to 9.8 × 10−16 eV m for a gate electric field of 0.5 V nm−1; that is, it is gate tuneable and the spin splitting of 0.6 μeV is relatively large. Our finding establishes a family of spin–orbit systems."
138,A singlet-triplet hole spin qubit in planar Ge,2021-06-03,"Spin qubits are considered to be among the most promising candidates for building a quantum processor. Group IV hole spin qubits are particularly interesting owing to their ease of operation and compatibility with Si technology. In addition, Ge offers the option for monolithic superconductor–semiconductor integration. Here, we demonstrate a hole spin qubit operating at fields below 10 mT, the critical field of Al, by exploiting the large out-of-plane hole g-factors in planar Ge and by encoding the qubit into the singlet-triplet states of a double quantum dot. We observe electrically controlled g-factor difference-driven and exchange-driven rotations with tunable frequencies exceeding 100 MHz and dephasing times of 1 μs, which we extend beyond 150 μs using echo techniques. These results demonstrate that Ge hole singlet-triplet qubits are competing with state-of-the-art GaAs and Si singlet-triplet qubits. In addition, their rotation frequencies and coherence are comparable with those of Ge single spin qubits, but singlet-triplet qubits can be operated at much lower fields, emphasizing their potential for on-chip integration with superconducting technologies."
139,Tension–compression asymmetry in amorphous silicon,2021-05-31,"Hard and brittle materials usually exhibit a much lower strength when loaded in tension than in compression. However, this common-sense behaviour may not be intrinsic to these materials, but arises from their higher flaw sensitivity to tensile loading. Here, we demonstrate a reversed and unusually pronounced tension–compression asymmetry (tensile strength exceeds compressive strength by a large margin) in submicrometre-sized samples of isotropic amorphous silicon. The abnormal asymmetry in the yield strength and anelasticity originates from the reduction in shear modulus and the densification of the shear-activated configuration under compression, altering the magnitude of the activation energy barrier for elementary shear events in amorphous Si. In situ coupled electrical tests corroborate that compressive strains indeed cause increased atomic coordination (metallization) by transforming some local structures from sp3-bonded semiconducting motifs to more metallic-like sites, lending credence to the mechanism we propose. This finding opens up an unexplored regime of intrinsic tension–compression asymmetry in materials."
140,Oxygen-evolving catalytic atoms on metal carbides,2021-05-31,"Single-atom catalysts have shown promising performance in various catalytic reactions. Catalytic metal sites supported on oxides or carbonaceous materials are usually strongly coordinated by oxygen or heteroatoms, which naturally affects their electronic environment and consequently their catalytic activity. Here, we reveal the stabilization of single-atom catalysts on tungsten carbides without the aid of heteroatom coordination for efficient catalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from the unique structure of tungsten carbides, the atomic FeNi catalytic sites are weakly bonded with the surface W and C atoms. The reported catalyst shows a low overpotential of 237 mV at 10 mA cm−2, which can even be lowered to 211 mV when the FeNi content is increased, a high turnover frequency value of 4.96 s−1 (η = 300 mV) and good stability (1,000 h). Density functional theory calculations show that either metallic Fe/Ni atoms or (hydro)oxide FeNi species are responsible for the high OER activity. We suggest that the application of inexpensive and durable WCx supports opens up a promising pathway to develop further single-atom catalysts for electrochemical catalytic reactions"
141,Visualization of the strain-induced topological phase transition in a quasi-one-dimensional superconductor TaSe,2021-05-20,"Control of the phase transition from topological to normal insulators can allow for an on/off switching of spin current. While topological phase transitions have been realized by elemental substitution in semiconducting alloys, such an approach requires preparation of materials with various compositions. Thus it is quite far from a feasible device application, which demands a reversible operation. Here we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to visualize the strain-driven band-structure evolution of the quasi-one-dimensional superconductor TaSe3. We demonstrate that it undergoes reversible strain-induced topological phase transitions from a strong topological insulator phase with spin-polarized, quasi-one-dimensional topological surface states, to topologically trivial semimetal and band insulating phases. The quasi-one-dimensional superconductor TaSe3 provides a suitable platform for engineering the topological spintronics, for example as an on/off switch for a spin current that is robust against impurity scattering."
142,Quantifying charge carrier localization in chemically doped semiconducting polymers,2021-05-20,"Charge transport in semiconducting polymers ranges from localized (hopping-like) to delocalized (metal-like), yet no quantitative model exists to fully capture this transport spectrum and its dependency on charge carrier density. In this study, using an archetypal polymer–dopant system, we measure the temperature-dependent electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient and extent of oxidation. We then use these measurements to develop a semi-localized transport (SLoT) model, which captures both localized and delocalized transport contributions. By applying the SLoT model to published data, we demonstrate its broad utility. We are able to determine system-dependent parameters such as the maximum localization energy of the system, how this localization energy changes with doping, the amount of dopant required to achieve metal-like conductivity and the conductivity a system could have in the absence of localization effects. This proposed SLoT model improves our ability to predict and tailor electronic properties of doped semiconducting polymers."
143,Revealing the role of the cathode–electrolyte interface on solid-state batteries,2021-05-20,"Interfaces have crucial, but still poorly understood, roles in the performance of secondary solid-state batteries. Here, using crystallographically oriented and highly faceted thick cathodes, we directly assess the impact of cathode crystallography and morphology on the long-term performance of solid-state batteries. The controlled interface crystallography, area and microstructure of these cathodes enables an understanding of interface instabilities unknown (hidden) in conventional thin-film and composite solid-state electrodes. A generic and direct correlation between cell performance and interface stability is revealed for a variety of both lithium- and sodium-based cathodes and solid electrolytes. Our findings highlight that minimizing interfacial area, rather than its expansion as is the case in conventional composite cathodes, is key to both understanding the nature of interface instabilities and improving cell performance. Our findings also point to the use of dense and thick cathodes as a way of increasing the energy density and stability of solid-state batteries."
144,Chiral-spin rotation of non-collinear antiferromagnet by spin–orbit torque,2021-05-13,"Electrical manipulation of magnetic materials by current-induced spin torque constitutes the basis of spintronics. Here, we show an unconventional response to spin–orbit torque of a non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn, which has attracted attention owing to its large anomalous Hall effect despite a vanishingly small net magnetization. In epitaxial heavy-metal/Mn3Sn heterostructures, we observe a characteristic fluctuation of the Hall resistance under the application of electric current. This observation is explained by a rotation of the chiral-spin structure of Mn3Sn driven by spin–orbit torque. We find that the variation of the magnitude of anomalous Hall effect fluctuation with sample size correlates with the number of magnetic domains in the Mn3Sn layer. In addition, the dependence of the critical current on Mn3Sn layer thickness reveals that spin–orbit torque generated by small current densities, below 20 MA cm−2, effectively acts on the chiral-spin structure even in Mn3Sn layers that are thicker than 20 nm. The results provide additional pathways for electrical manipulation of magnetic materials."
145,Bosonic condensation of exciton–polaritons in an atomically thin crystal,2021-05-06,"The emergence of two-dimensional crystals has revolutionized modern solid-state physics. From a fundamental point of view, the enhancement of charge carrier correlations has sparked much research activity in the transport and quantum optics communities. One of the most intriguing effects, in this regard, is the bosonic condensation and spontaneous coherence of many-particle complexes. Here we find compelling evidence of bosonic condensation of exciton–polaritons emerging from an atomically thin crystal of MoSe2 embedded in a dielectric microcavity under optical pumping at cryogenic temperatures. The formation of the condensate manifests itself in a sudden increase of luminescence intensity in a threshold-like manner, and a notable spin-polarizability in an externally applied magnetic field. Spatial coherence is mapped out via highly resolved real-space interferometry, revealing a spatially extended condensate. Our device represents a decisive step towards the implementation of coherent light-sources based on atomically thin crystals, as well as non-linear, valleytronic coherent devices."
146,Fast crystal growth at ultra-low temperatures,2021-05-06,"It is believed that the slow liquid diffusion and geometric frustration brought by a rapid, deep quench inhibit fast crystallization and promote vitrification. Here we report fast crystal growth in charged colloidal systems under deep supercooling, where liquid diffusion is extremely low. By combining experiments and simulations, we show that this process occurs via wall-induced barrierless ordering consisting of two coupled steps: the step-like advancement of the rough interface that disintegrates frustration, followed by defect repairing inside the newly formed solid phase. The former is a diffusionless collective process, whereas the latter controls crystal quality. We further show that the intrinsic mechanical instability of a disordered glassy state subject to the crystal growth front allows for domino-like fast crystal growth even at ultra-low temperatures. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of fast crystal growth and may be useful for applications related to vitrification prevention and crystal-quality control."
147,Solid-state rigid-rod polymer composite electrolytes with nanocrystalline lithium ion pathways,2021-05-03,"A critical challenge for next-generation lithium-based batteries lies in development of electrolytes that enable thermal safety along with the use of high-energy-density electrodes. We describe molecular ionic composite electrolytes based on an aligned liquid crystalline polymer combined with ionic liquids and concentrated Li salt. This high strength (200 MPa) and non-flammable solid electrolyte possesses outstanding Li+ conductivity (1 mS cm−1 at 25 °C) and electrochemical stability (5.6 V versus Li|Li+) while suppressing dendrite growth and exhibiting low interfacial resistance (32 Ω cm2) and overpotentials (≤120 mV at 1 mA cm−2) during Li symmetric cell cycling. A heterogeneous salt doping process modifies a locally ordered polymer–ion assembly to incorporate an inter-grain network filled with defective LiFSI and LiBF4 nanocrystals, strongly enhancing Li+ conduction. This modular material fabrication platform shows promise for safe and high-energy-density energy storage and conversion applications, incorporating the fast transport of ceramic-like conductors with the superior flexibility of polymer electrolytes."
148,Elastohydrodynamic friction of robotic and human fingers on soft micropatterned substrates,2021-04-29,"Frictional sliding between patterned surfaces is of fundamental and practical importance in the haptic engineering of soft materials. In emerging applications such as remote surgery and soft robotics, thin fluid films between solid surfaces lead to a multiphysics coupling between solid deformation and fluid dissipation. Here, we report a scaling law that governs the peak friction values of elastohydrodynamic lubrication on patterned surfaces. These peaks, absent in smooth tribopairs, arise due to a separation of length scales in the lubricant flow. The framework is generated by varying the geometry, elasticity and fluid properties of soft tribopairs and measuring the lubricated friction with a triborheometer. The model correctly predicts the elastohydrodynamic lubrication friction of a bioinspired robotic fingertip and human fingers. Its broad applicability can inform the future design of robotic hands or grippers in realistic conditions, and open up new ways of encoding friction into haptic signals."
149,Minimizing hydrogen vacancies to enable highly efficient hybrid perovskites,2021-04-29,"Defect-induced non-radiative losses are currently limiting the performance of hybrid perovskite devices. Experimental reports have indicated the existence of point defects that act as detrimental non-radiative recombination centres under iodine-poor synthesis conditions. However, the microscopic nature of these defects is still unknown. Here we demonstrate that hydrogen vacancies can be present in high densities under iodine-poor conditions in the prototypical hybrid perovskite MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3). They act as very efficient non-radiative recombination centres with an exceptionally high carrier capture coefficient of 10−4 cm3 s−1. By contrast, the hydrogen vacancies in FAPbI3 [FA = CH(NH2)2] are much more difficult to form and have a capture coefficient that is three orders of magnitude lower. Our study unveils the critical but overlooked role of hydrogen vacancies in hybrid perovskites and rationalizes why FA is essential for realizing high efficiency in hybrid perovskite solar cells. Minimizing the incorporation of hydrogen vacancies is key to enabling the best performance of hybrid perovskites."
150,Mechano-tunable chiral metasurfaces via colloidal assembly,2021-04-29,"Dynamic control of circular polarization in chiral metasurfaces is being used in many photonic applications. However, simple fabrication routes to create chiral materials with considerable and fully tunable chiroptical responses at visible and near-infrared wavelengths are scarce. Here, we describe a scalable bottom-up approach to construct cross-stacked nanoparticle chain arrays that have a circular dichroism of up to 11°. Due to their layered design, the strong superchiral fields of the inter-layer region are accessible to chiral analytes, resulting in a tenfold enhanced sensitivity in a chiral sensing proof-of-concept experiment. In situ restacking and local mechanical compression enables full control over the entire set of circular dichroism characteristics, namely sign, magnitude and spectral position. Strain-induced reconfiguration opens up an intriguing route towards actively controlled pixel arrays using local deformation, which fosters continuous polarization engineering and multi-channel detection."
151,Spin-induced linear polarization of photoluminescence in antiferromagnetic van der Waals crystals,2021-04-26,"Antiferromagnets are promising components for spintronics due to their terahertz resonance, multilevel states and absence of stray fields. However, the zero net magnetic moment of antiferromagnets makes the detection of the antiferromagnetic order and the investigation of fundamental spin properties notoriously difficult. Here, we report an optical detection of Néel vector orientation through an ultra-sharp photoluminescence in the van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS3 from bulk to atomically thin flakes. The strong correlation between spin flipping and electric dipole oscillator results in a linear polarization of the sharp emission, which aligns perpendicular to the spin orientation in the crystal. By applying an in-plane magnetic field, we achieve manipulation of the photoluminescence polarization. This correlation between emitted photons and spins in layered magnets provides routes for investigating magneto-optics in two-dimensional materials, and hence opens a path for developing opto-spintronic devices and antiferromagnet-based quantum information technologies."
152,Adduct-based p-doping of organic semiconductors,2021-04-22,"Electronic doping of organic semiconductors is essential for their usage in highly efficient optoelectronic devices. Although molecular and metal complex-based dopants have already enabled significant progress of devices based on organic semiconductors, there remains a need for clean, efficient and low-cost dopants if a widespread transition towards larger-area organic electronic devices is to occur. Here we report dimethyl sulfoxide adducts as p-dopants that fulfil these conditions for a range of organic semiconductors. These adduct-based dopants are compatible with both solution and vapour-phase processing. We explore the doping mechanism and use the knowledge we gain to ‘decouple’ the dopants from the choice of counterion. We demonstrate that asymmetric p-doping is possible using solution processing routes, and demonstrate its use in metal halide perovskite solar cells, organic thin-film transistors and organic light-emitting diodes, which showcases the versatility of this doping approach."
153,Visualizing plating-induced cracking in lithium-anode solid-electrolyte cells,2021-04-22,"Lithium dendrite (filament) propagation through ceramic electrolytes, leading to short circuits at high rates of charge, is one of the greatest barriers to realizing high-energy-density all-solid-state lithium-anode batteries. Utilizing in situ X-ray computed tomography coupled with spatially mapped X-ray diffraction, the propagation of cracks and the propagation of lithium dendrites through the solid electrolyte have been tracked in a Li/Li6PS5Cl/Li cell as a function of the charge passed. On plating, cracking initiates with spallation, conical ‘pothole’-like cracks that form in the ceramic electrolyte near the surface with the plated electrode. The spallations form predominantly at the lithium electrode edges where local fields are high. Transverse cracks then propagate from the spallations across the electrolyte from the plated to the stripped electrode. Lithium ingress drives the propagation of the spallation and transverse cracks by widening the crack from the rear; that is, the crack front propagates ahead of the Li. As a result, cracks traverse the entire electrolyte before the Li arrives at the other electrode, and therefore before a short circuit occurs."
154,High-rate nanofluidic energy absorption in porous zeolitic frameworks,2021-04-22,"Optimal mechanical impact absorbers are reusable and exhibit high specific energy absorption. The forced intrusion of liquid water in hydrophobic nanoporous materials, such as zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), presents an attractive pathway to engineer such systems. However, to harness their full potential, it is crucial to understand the underlying water intrusion and extrusion mechanisms under realistic, high-rate deformation conditions. Here, we report a critical increase of the energy absorption capacity of confined water-ZIF systems at elevated strain rates. Starting from ZIF-8 as proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that this attractive rate dependence is generally applicable to cage-type ZIFs but disappears for channel-containing zeolites. Molecular simulations reveal that this phenomenon originates from the intrinsic nanosecond timescale needed for critical-sized water clusters to nucleate inside the nanocages, expediting water transport through the framework. Harnessing this fundamental understanding, design rules are formulated to construct effective, tailorable and reusable impact energy absorbers for challenging new applications."
155,Electronic properties of the bulk and surface states of Fe,2021-04-22,"The idea of employing non-Abelian statistics for error-free quantum computing ignited interest in reports of topological surface superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in FeTe0.55Se0.45. However, the topological features and superconducting properties are not observed uniformly across the sample surface. The understanding and practical control of these electronic inhomogeneities present a prominent challenge for potential applications. Here, we combine neutron scattering, scanning angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and microprobe composition and resistivity measurements to characterize the electronic state of Fe1+yTe1−xSex. We establish a phase diagram in which the superconductivity is observed only at sufficiently low Fe concentration, in association with distinct antiferromagnetic correlations, whereas the coexisting topological surface state occurs only at sufficiently high Te concentration. We find that FeTe0.55Se0.45 is located very close to both phase boundaries, which explains the inhomogeneity of superconducting and topological states. Our results demonstrate the compositional control required for use of topological MZMs in practical applications."
156,Integrated computer-aided engineering and design for DNA assemblies,2021-04-19,"Recently, DNA has been used to make nanodevices for a myriad of applications across fields including medicine, nanomanufacturing, synthetic biology, biosensing and biophysics. However, current DNA nanodevices rely primarily on geometric design, and it remains challenging to rationally design functional properties such as force-response or actuation behaviour. Here we report an iterative design pipeline for DNA assemblies that integrates computer-aided engineering based on coarse-grained molecular dynamics with a versatile computer-aided design approach that combines top-down automation with bottom-up control over geometry. This intuitive framework allows for rapid construction of large, multicomponent assemblies from three-dimensional models with finer control over the geometrical, mechanical and dynamical properties of the DNA structures in an automated manner. This approach expands the scope of structural complexity and enhances mechanical and dynamic design of DNA assemblies."
157,A printable active network actuator built from an engineered biomolecular motor,2021-04-19,"Leveraging the motion and force of individual molecular motors in a controlled manner to perform macroscopic tasks can provide substantial benefits to many applications, including robotics. Nonetheless, although millimetre-scale movement has been demonstrated with synthetic and biological molecular motors, their efficient integration into engineered systems that perform macroscopic tasks remains challenging. Here, we describe an active network capable of macroscopic actuation that is hierarchically assembled from an engineered kinesin, a biomolecular motor, and microtubules, resembling the contractile units in muscles. These contracting materials can be formed in desired areas using patterned ultraviolet illumination, allowing their incorporation into mechanically engineered systems, being also compatible with printing technologies. Due to the designed filamentous assembly of kinesins, the generated forces reach the micronewton range, enabling actuation of millimetre-scale mechanical components. These properties may be useful for the fabrication of soft robotic systems with advanced functionalities."
158,Extraction of mobile charge carrier photogeneration yield spectrum of ultrathin-film metal oxide photoanodes for solar water splitting,2021-04-19,"Light absorption in strongly correlated electron materials can excite electrons and holes into a variety of different states. Some of these excitations yield mobile charge carriers, whereas others result in localized states that cannot contribute to photocurrent. The photogeneration yield spectrum, ξ(λ), represents the wavelength-dependent ratio between the contributing absorption that ultimately generates mobile charge carriers and the overall absorption. Despite being a vital material property, it is not trivial to characterize. Here, we present an empirical method to extract ξ(λ) through optical and external quantum efficiency measurements of ultrathin films. We applied this method to haematite photoanodes for water photo-oxidation, and observed that it is self-consistent for different illumination conditions and applied potentials. We found agreement between the extracted ξ(λ) spectrum and the photoconductivity spectrum measured by time-resolved microwave conductivity. These measurements revealed that mobile charge carrier generation increases with increasing energy across haematite’s absorption spectrum. Low-energy non-contributing absorption fundamentally limits the photoconversion efficiency of haematite photoanodes and provides an upper limit to the achievable photocurrent that is substantially lower than that predicted based solely on absorption above the bandgap. We extended our analysis to TiO2 and BiVO4 photoanodes, demonstrating the broader utility of the method for determining ξ(λ)."
159,Enhanced substrate stress relaxation promotes filopodia-mediated cell migration,2021-04-19,"Cell migration on two-dimensional substrates is typically characterized by lamellipodia at the leading edge, mature focal adhesions and spread morphologies. These observations result from adherent cell migration studies on stiff, elastic substrates, because most cells do not migrate on soft, elastic substrates. However, many biological tissues are soft and viscoelastic, exhibiting stress relaxation over time in response to a deformation. Here, we have systematically investigated the impact of substrate stress relaxation on cell migration on soft substrates. We observed that cells migrate minimally on substrates with an elastic modulus of 2 kPa that are elastic or exhibit slow stress relaxation, but migrate robustly on 2-kPa substrates that exhibit fast stress relaxation. Strikingly, migrating cells were not spread out and did not extend lamellipodial protrusions, but were instead rounded, with filopodia protrusions extending at the leading edge, and exhibited small nascent adhesions. Computational models of cell migration based on a motor–clutch framework predict the observed impact of substrate stress relaxation on cell migration and filopodia dynamics. Our findings establish substrate stress relaxation as a key requirement for robust cell migration on soft substrates and uncover a mode of two-dimensional cell migration marked by round morphologies, filopodia protrusions and weak adhesions."
160,Strain fields in twisted bilayer graphene,2021-04-15,"Van der Waals heteroepitaxy allows deterministic control over lattice mismatch or azimuthal orientation between atomic layers to produce long-wavelength superlattices. The resulting electronic phases depend critically on the superlattice periodicity and localized structural deformations that introduce disorder and strain. In this study we used Bragg interferometry to capture atomic displacement fields in twisted bilayer graphene with twist angles <2°. Nanoscale spatial fluctuations in twist angle and uniaxial heterostrain were statistically evaluated, revealing the prevalence of short-range disorder in moiré heterostructures. By quantitatively mapping strain tensor fields, we uncovered two regimes of structural relaxation and disentangled the electronic contributions of constituent rotation modes. Further, we found that applied heterostrain accumulates anisotropically in saddle-point regions, generating distinctive striped strain phases. Our results establish the reconstruction mechanics underpinning the twist-angle-dependent electronic behaviour of twisted bilayer graphene and provide a framework for directly visualizing structural relaxation, disorder and strain in moiré materials."
161,Metastable 1T′-phase group VIB transition metal dichalcogenide crystals,2021-04-15,"Metastable 1T′-phase transition metal dichalcogenides (1T′-TMDs) with semi-metallic natures have attracted increasing interest owing to their uniquely distorted structures and fascinating phase-dependent physicochemical properties. However, the synthesis of high-quality metastable 1T′-TMD crystals, especially for the group VIB TMDs, remains a challenge. Here, we report a general synthetic method for the large-scale preparation of metastable 1T′-phase group VIB TMDs, including WS2, WSe2, MoS2, MoSe2, WS2xSe2(1−x) and MoS2xSe2(1−x). We solve the crystal structures of 1T′-WS2, -WSe2, -MoS2 and -MoSe2 with single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The as-prepared 1T′-WS2 exhibits thickness-dependent intrinsic superconductivity, showing critical transition temperatures of 8.6 K for the thickness of 90.1 nm and 5.7 K for the single layer, which we attribute to the high intrinsic carrier concentration and the semi-metallic nature of 1T′-WS2. This synthesis method will allow a more systematic investigation of the intrinsic properties of metastable TMDs."
162,Three-dimensional nanolithography guided by DNA modular epitaxy,2021-04-12,"Lithographic scaling of periodic three-dimensional patterns is critical for advancing scalable nanomanufacturing. Current state-of-the-art quadruple patterning or extreme-ultraviolet lithography produce a line pitch down to around 30 nm, which might be further scaled to sub-20 nm through complex post-fabrication processes. Herein, we report the use of three-dimensional (3D) DNA nanostructures to scale the line pitch down to 16.2 nm, around 50% smaller than state-of-the-art results. We use a DNA modular epitaxy approach to fabricate 3D DNA masks with prescribed structural parameters (geometry, pitch and critical dimensions) along a designer assembly pathway. Single-run reactive ion etching then transfers the DNA patterns to a Si substrate at a lateral critical dimension of 7 nm and a vertical critical dimension of 2 nm. The nanolithography guided by DNA modular epitaxy achieves a smaller pitch than the projected values for advanced technology nodes in field-effect transistors, and provides a potential complement to the existing lithographic tools for advanced 3D nanomanufacturing."
163,Development of a photoelectrochemically self-improving Si/GaN photocathode for efficient and durable H,2021-04-05,"Development of an efficient yet durable photoelectrode is of paramount importance for deployment of solar-fuel production. Here, we report the photoelectrochemically self-improving behaviour of a silicon/gallium nitride photocathode active for hydrogen production with a Faradaic efficiency approaching ~100%. By using a correlative approach based on different spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, as well as density functional theory calculations, we provide a mechanistic understanding of the chemical transformation that is the origin of the self-improving behaviour. A thin layer of gallium oxynitride forms on the side walls of the gallium nitride grains, via a partial oxygen substitution at nitrogen sites, and displays a higher density of catalytic sites for the hydrogen-evolving reaction. This work demonstrates that the chemical transformation of gallium nitride into gallium oxynitride leads to sustained operation and enhanced catalytic activity, thus showing promise for oxynitride layers as protective catalytic coatings for hydrogen evolution."
164,High-performance organic pseudocapacitors via molecular contortion,2021-04-01,"Pseudocapacitors harness unique charge-storage mechanisms to enable high-capacity, rapidly cycling devices. Here we describe an organic system composed of perylene diimide and hexaazatrinaphthylene exhibiting a specific capacitance of 689 F g−1 at a rate of 0.5 A g−1, stability over 50,000 cycles, and unprecedented performance at rates as high as 75 A g−1. We incorporate the material into two-electrode devices for a practical demonstration of its potential in next-generation energy-storage systems. We identify the source of this exceptionally high rate charge storage as surface-mediated pseudocapacitance, through a combination of spectroscopic, computational and electrochemical measurements. By underscoring the importance of molecular contortion and complementary electronic attributes in the selection of molecular components, these results provide a general strategy for the creation of organic high-performance energy-storage materials."
165,Mid-infrared radiative emission from bright hot plasmons in graphene,2021-04-01,"Carrier excitation and decay processes in graphene are of broad interest since relaxation pathways that are not present in conventional materials are enabled by a gapless Dirac electronic band structure. Here, we report that a previously unobserved decay pathway—hot plasmon emission—results in Fermi-level-dependent mid-infrared emission in graphene. Our observations of non-thermal contributions to Fermi-level-dependent radiation are an experimental demonstration of hot plasmon emission arising from a photo-inverted carrier distribution in graphene achieved via ultrafast optical excitation. Our calculations indicate that the reported plasmon emission process can be several orders of magnitude brighter than Planckian emission mechanisms in the mid-infrared spectral range. Both the use of gold nanodisks to promote scattering and localized plasmon excitation and polarization-dependent excitation measurements provide further evidence for bright hot plasmon emission. These findings define an approach for future work on ultrafast and ultrabright graphene emission processes and mid-infrared light source applications."
166,Phonon renormalization in reconstructed MoS,2021-03-22,"In moiré crystals formed by stacking van der Waals materials, surprisingly diverse correlated electronic phases and optical properties can be realized by a subtle change in the twist angle. Here, we discover that phonon spectra are also renormalized in MoS2 twisted bilayers, adding an insight to moiré physics. Over a range of small twist angles, the phonon spectra evolve rapidly owing to ultra-strong coupling between different phonon modes and atomic reconstructions of the moiré pattern. We develop a low-energy continuum model for phonons that overcomes the outstanding challenge of calculating the properties of large moiré supercells and successfully captures the essential experimental observations. Remarkably, simple optical spectroscopy experiments can provide information on strain and lattice distortions in moiré crystals with nanometre-size supercells. The model promotes a comprehensive and unified understanding of the structural, optical and electronic properties of moiré superlattices."
167,Thermally conductive ultra-low,2021-03-18,"As the features of microprocessors are miniaturized, low-dielectric-constant (low-k) materials are necessary to limit electronic crosstalk, charge build-up, and signal propagation delay. However, all known low-k dielectrics exhibit low thermal conductivities, which complicate heat dissipation in high-power-density chips. Two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) combine immense permanent porosities, which lead to low dielectric permittivities, and periodic layered structures, which grant relatively high thermal conductivities. However, conventional synthetic routes produce 2D COFs that are unsuitable for the evaluation of these properties and integration into devices. Here, we report the fabrication of high-quality COF thin films, which enable thermoreflectance and impedance spectroscopy measurements. These measurements reveal that 2D COFs have high thermal conductivities (1 W m−1 K−1) with ultra-low dielectric permittivities (k = 1.6). These results show that oriented, layered 2D polymers are promising next-generation dielectric layers and that these molecularly precise materials offer tunable combinations of useful properties."
168,Microstructural origin of locally enhanced CO,2021-03-18,"Understanding how the bulk structure of a material affects catalysis on its surface is critical to the development of actionable catalyst design principles. Bulk defects have been shown to affect electrocatalytic materials that are important for energy conversion systems, but the structural origins of these effects have not been fully elucidated. Here we use a combination of high-resolution scanning electrochemical cell microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction to visualize the potential-dependent electrocatalytic carbon dioxide \(({\mathrm{C}}{\mathrm{O}}_{2})\) electroreduction and hydrogen \(({{\mathrm{H}}_{2}})\) evolution activity on Au electrodes and probe the effects of bulk defects. Comparing colocated activity maps and videos to the underlying microstructure and lattice deformation supports a model in which CO2 electroreduction is selectively enhanced by surface-terminating dislocations, which can accumulate at grain boundaries and slip bands. Our results suggest that the deliberate introduction of dislocations into materials is a promising strategy for improving catalytic properties."
169,Two-dimensional overdamped fluctuations of the soft perovskite lattice in CsPbBr,2021-03-15,"Lead halide perovskites exhibit structural instabilities and large atomic fluctuations thought to impact their optical and thermal properties, yet detailed structural and temporal correlations of their atomic motions remain poorly understood. Here, these correlations are resolved in CsPbBr3 crystals using momentum-resolved neutron and X-ray scattering measurements as a function of temperature, complemented with first-principles simulations. We uncover a striking network of diffuse scattering rods, arising from the liquid-like damping of low-energy Br-dominated phonons, reproduced in our simulations of the anharmonic phonon self-energy. These overdamped modes cover a continuum of wave vectors along the edges of the cubic Brillouin zone, corresponding to two-dimensional sheets of correlated rotations in real space, and could represent precursors to proposed two-dimensional polarons. Further, these motions directly impact the electronic gap edge states, linking soft anharmonic lattice dynamics and optoelectronic properties. These results provide insights into the highly unusual atomic dynamics of halide perovskites, relevant to further optimization of their optical and thermal properties."
170,Fictitious phase separation in Li layered oxides driven by electro-autocatalysis,2021-03-08,"Layered oxides widely used as lithium-ion battery electrodes are designed to be cycled under conditions that avoid phase transitions. Although the desired single-phase composition ranges are well established near equilibrium, operando diffraction studies on many-particle porous electrodes have suggested phase separation during delithiation. Notably, the separation is not always observed, and never during lithiation. These anomalies have been attributed to irreversible processes during the first delithiation or reversible concentration-dependent diffusion. However, these explanations are not consistent with all experimental observations such as rate and path dependencies and particle-by-particle lithium concentration changes. Here, we show that the apparent phase separation is a dynamical artefact occurring in a many-particle system driven by autocatalytic electrochemical reactions, that is, an interfacial exchange current that increases with the extent of delithiation. We experimentally validate this population-dynamics model using the single-phase material Lix(Ni1/3Mn1/3Co1/3)O2 (0.5 < x < 1) and demonstrate generality with other transition-metal compositions. Operando diffraction and nanoscale oxidation-state mapping unambiguously prove that this fictitious phase separation is a repeatable non-equilibrium effect. We quantitatively confirm the theory with multiple-datastream-driven model extraction. More generally, our study experimentally demonstrates the control of ensemble stability by electro-autocatalysis, highlighting the importance of population dynamics in battery electrodes (even non-phase-separating ones)."
171,Electrolyte melt infiltration for scalable manufacturing of inorganic all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries,2021-03-08,"All-solid-state lithium (Li) metal and lithium-ion batteries (ASSLBs) with inorganic solid-state electrolytes offer improved safety for electric vehicles and other applications. However, current inorganic ASSLB manufacturing technology suffers from high cost, excessive amounts of solid-state electrolyte and conductive additives, and low attainable volumetric energy density. Such a fabrication method involves separate fabrications of sintered ceramic solid-state electrolyte membranes and ASSLB electrodes, which are then carefully stacked and sintered together in a precisely controlled environment. Here we report a disruptive manufacturing technology that offers reduced manufacturing costs and improved volumetric energy density in all solid cells. Our approach mimics the low-cost fabrication of commercial Li-ion cells with liquid electrolytes, except that we utilize solid-state electrolytes with low melting points that are infiltrated into dense, thermally stable electrodes at moderately elevated temperatures (~300 °C or below) in a liquid state, and which then solidify during cooling. Nearly the same commercial equipment could be used for electrode and cell manufacturing, which substantially reduces a barrier for industry adoption. This energy-efficient method was used to fabricate inorganic ASSLBs with LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 cathodes and both Li4Ti5O12 and graphite anodes. The promising performance characteristics of such cells open new opportunities for the accelerated adoption of ASSLBs for safer electric transportation."
172,Van der Waals epitaxial growth of air-stable CrSe,2021-03-01,"The discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetism in ultrathin two-dimensional van der Waals crystals opens up exciting prospects for exploring magnetism in the ultimate two-dimensional limit. Here, we show that environmentally stable CrSe2 nanosheets can be readily grown on a dangling-bond-free WSe2 substrate with systematically tunable thickness down to the monolayer limit. These CrSe2/WSe2 heterostructures display high-quality van der Waals interfaces with well-resolved moiré superlattices and ferromagnetic behaviour. We find no apparent change in surface roughness or magnetic properties after months of exposure in air. Our calculations suggest that charge transfer from the WSe2 substrate and interlayer coupling within CrSe2 play a critical role in the magnetic order in few-layer CrSe2 nanosheets. The highly controllable growth of environmentally stable CrSe2 nanosheets with tunable thickness defines a robust two-dimensional magnet for fundamental studies and potential applications in magnetoelectronic and spintronic devices."
173,Efficient and low-voltage vertical organic permeable base light-emitting transistors,2021-03-01,"Organic light-emitting transistors, three-terminal devices combining a thin-film transistor with a light-emitting diode, have generated increasing interest in organic electronics. However, increasing their efficiency while keeping the operating voltage low still remains a key challenge. Here, we demonstrate organic permeable base light-emitting transistors; these three-terminal vertical optoelectronic devices operate at driving voltages below 5.0 V; emit in the red, green and blue ranges; and reach, respectively, peak external quantum efficiencies of 19.6%, 24.6% and 11.8%, current efficiencies of 20.6 cd A–1, 90.1 cd A–1 and 27.1 cd A–1 and maximum luminance values of 9,833 cd m–2, 12,513 cd m–2 and 4,753 cd m–2. Our simulations demonstrate that the nano-pore permeable base electrode located at the centre of the device, which forms a distinctive optical microcavity and regulates charge carrier injection and transport, is the key to the good performance obtained. Our work paves the way towards efficient and low-voltage organic light-emitting transistors, useful for power-efficient active matrix displays and solid-state lighting."
174,Ultra-high-quality two-dimensional electron systems,2021-02-25,"Two-dimensional electrons confined to GaAs quantum wells are hallmark platforms for probing electron–electron interactions. Many key observations have been made in these systems as sample quality has improved over the years. Here, we present a breakthrough in sample quality via source-material purification and innovation in GaAs molecular beam epitaxy vacuum chamber design. Our samples display an ultra-high mobility of 44 × 106 cm2 V–1 s–1 at an electron density of 2.0 × 1011 cm–2. These results imply only 1 residual impurity for every 1010 Ga/As atoms. The impact of such low impurity concentration is manifold. Robust stripe and bubble phases are observed, and several new fractional quantum Hall states emerge. Furthermore, the activation gap (Δ) of the fractional quantum Hall state at the Landau-level filling (ν) = 5/2, which is widely believed to be non-Abelian and of potential use for topological quantum computing, reaches Δ ≈ 820 mK. We expect that our results will stimulate further research on interaction-driven physics in a two-dimensional setting and substantially advance the field."
175,Bio-inspired mechanically adaptive materials through vibration-induced crosslinking,2021-02-22,"In nature, bone adapts to mechanical forces it experiences, strengthening itself to match the conditions placed upon it. Here we report a composite material that adapts to the mechanical environment it experiences—varying its modulus as a function of force, time and the frequency of mechanical agitation. Adaptation in the material is managed by mechanically responsive ZnO, which controls a crosslinking reaction between a thiol and an alkene within a polymer composite gel, resulting in a mechanically driven ×66 increase in modulus. As the amount of chemical energy is a function of the mechanical energy input, the material senses and adapts its modulus along the distribution of stress, resembling the bone remodelling behaviour that materials can adapt accordingly to the loading location. Such material design might find use in a wide range of applications, from adhesives to materials that interface with biological systems."
176,Investigating the nature of active forces in tissues reveals how contractile cells can form extensile monolayers,2021-02-18,"Actomyosin machinery endows cells with contractility at a single-cell level. However, within a monolayer, cells can be contractile or extensile based on the direction of pushing or pulling forces exerted by their neighbours or on the substrate. It has been shown that a monolayer of fibroblasts behaves as a contractile system while epithelial or neural progentior monolayers behave as an extensile system. Through a combination of cell culture experiments and in silico modelling, we reveal the mechanism behind this switch in extensile to contractile as the weakening of intercellular contacts. This switch promotes the build-up of tension at the cell–substrate interface through an increase in actin stress fibres and traction forces. This is accompanied by mechanotransductive changes in vinculin and YAP activation. We further show that contractile and extensile differences in cell activity sort cells in mixtures, uncovering a generic mechanism for pattern formation during cell competition, and morphogenesis."
177,Highly stretchable multilayer electronic circuits using biphasic gallium-indium,2021-02-18,"Stretchable electronic circuits are critical for soft robots, wearable technologies and biomedical applications. Development of sophisticated stretchable circuits requires new materials with stable conductivity over large strains, and low-resistance interfaces between soft and conventional (rigid) electronic components. To address this need, we introduce biphasic Ga–In, a printable conductor with high conductivity (2.06 × 106 S m−1), extreme stretchability (>1,000%), negligible resistance change when strained, cyclic stability (consistent performance over 1,500 cycles) and a reliable interface with rigid electronics. We employ a scalable transfer-printing process to create various stretchable circuit board assemblies that maintain their performance when stretched, including a multilayer light-emitting diode display, an amplifier circuit and a signal conditioning board for wearable sensing applications. The compatibility of biphasic Ga–In with scalable manufacturing methods, robust interfaces with off-the-shelf electronic components and electrical/mechanical cyclic stability enable direct conversion of established circuit board assemblies to soft and stretchable forms."
178,Permeable superelastic liquid-metal fibre mat enables biocompatible and monolithic stretchable electronics,2021-02-18,"Stretchable electronics find widespread uses in a variety of applications such as wearable electronics, on-skin electronics, soft robotics and bioelectronics. Stretchable electronic devices conventionally built with elastomeric thin films show a lack of permeability, which not only impedes wearing comfort and creates skin inflammation over long-term wearing but also limits the design form factors of device integration in the vertical direction. Here, we report a stretchable conductor that is fabricated by simply coating or printing liquid metal onto an electrospun elastomeric fibre mat. We call this stretchable conductor a liquid-metal fibre mat. Liquid metal hanging among the elastomeric fibres self-organizes into a laterally mesh-like and vertically buckled structure, which offers simultaneously high permeability, stretchability, conductivity and electrical stability. Furthermore, the liquid-metal fibre mat shows good biocompatibility and smart adaptiveness to omnidirectional stretching over 1,800% strain. We demonstrate the use of a liquid-metal fibre mat as a building block to realize highly permeable, multifunctional monolithic stretchable electronics."
179,Coupled liquid crystalline oscillators in Huygens’ synchrony,2021-02-18,"In the flourishing field of soft robotics, strategies to embody communication and collective motion are scarce. Here we report the synchronized oscillations of thin plastic actuators by an approach reminiscent of the synchronized motion of pendula and metronomes. Two liquid crystalline network oscillators fuelled by light influence the movement of one another and display synchronized oscillations in-phase and anti-phase in a steady state. By observing entrainment between the asymmetric oscillators we demonstrate the existence of coupling between the two actuators. We qualitatively explain the origin of the synchronized motion using a theoretical model and numerical simulations, which suggest that the motion can be tuned by the mechanical properties of the coupling joint. We thus anticipate that the complex synchronization phenomena usually observed in rigid systems can also exist in soft polymeric materials. This enables the use of new stimuli, featuring an example of collective motion by photo-actuation."
180,Spatiotemporal control of liquid crystal structure and dynamics through activity patterning,2021-02-18,"Active materials are capable of converting free energy into mechanical work to produce autonomous motion, and exhibit striking collective dynamics that biology relies on for essential functions. Controlling those dynamics and transport in synthetic systems has been particularly challenging. Here, we introduce the concept of spatially structured activity as a means of controlling and manipulating transport in active nematic liquid crystals consisting of actin filaments and light-sensitive myosin motors. Simulations and experiments are used to demonstrate that topological defects can be generated at will and then constrained to move along specified trajectories by inducing local stresses in an otherwise passive material. These results provide a foundation for the design of autonomous and reconfigurable microfluidic systems where transport is controlled by modulating activity with light."
181,Higher-order topological semimetal in acoustic crystals,2021-02-15,"The notion of higher-order topological insulators has endowed materials with topological states beyond the first order. Particularly, a three-dimensional (3D) higher-order topological insulator can host topologically protected 1D hinge states, referred to as the second-order topological insulator, or 0D corner states, referred to as the third-order topological insulator. Similarly, a 3D higher-order topological semimetal can be envisaged if it hosts states on the 1D hinges. Here we report the realization of a second-order topological Weyl semimetal in a 3D-printed acoustic crystal, which possesses Weyl points in 3D momentum space, 2D Fermi arc states on surfaces and 1D gapless states on hinges. Like the arc surface states, the hinge states also connect the projections of the Weyl points. Our experimental results evidence the existence of the higher-order topological semimetal, which may pave the way towards innovative acoustic devices."
182,"Chern insulators, van Hove singularities and topological flat bands in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene",2021-02-15,"Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene exhibits intriguing quantum phase transitions triggered by enhanced electron–electron interactions when its flat bands are partially filled. However, the phases themselves and their connection to the putative non-trivial topology of the flat bands are largely unexplored. Here we report transport measurements revealing a succession of doping-induced Lifshitz transitions that are accompanied by van Hove singularities, which facilitate the emergence of correlation-induced gaps and topologically non-trivial subbands. In the presence of a magnetic field, well-quantized Hall plateaus at a filling of 1,2,3 carriers per moiré cell reveal the subband topology and signal the emergence of Chern insulators with Chern numbers, C = 3,2,1, respectively. Surprisingly, for magnetic fields exceeding 5 T we observe a van Hove singularity at a filling of 3.5, suggesting the possibility of a fractional Chern insulator. This van Hove singularity is accompanied by a crossover from low-temperature metallic, to high-temperature insulating behaviour, characteristic of entropically driven Pomeranchuk-like transitions."
183,Chirality-driven topological electronic structure of DNA-like materials,2021-02-08,"Topological aspects of the geometry of DNA and similar chiral molecules have received a lot of attention, but the topology of their electronic structure is less explored. Previous experiments revealed that DNA can efficiently filter spin-polarized electrons between metal contacts, a process called chiral-induced spin selectivity. However, the underlying correlation between chiral structure and electronic spin remains elusive. In this work, we reveal an orbital texture in the band structure, a topological characteristic induced by the chirality. We found that this orbital texture enables the chiral molecule to polarize the quantum orbital. This orbital polarization effect (OPE) induces spin polarization assisted by the spin–orbit interaction of a metal contact and leads to magnetoresistance and chiral separation. The orbital angular momentum of photoelectrons also plays an essential role in related photoemission experiments. Beyond chiral-induced spin selectivity, we predict that the orbital polarization effect could induce spin-selective phenomena even in achiral but inversion-breaking materials."
184,Membrane-destabilizing ionizable phospholipids for organ-selective mRNA delivery and CRISPR–Cas gene editing,2021-02-04,"Endosomal escape remains a fundamental barrier hindering the advancement of nucleic acid therapeutics. Taking inspiration from natural phospholipids that comprise biological membranes, we report the combinatorial synthesis of multi-tailed ionizable phospholipids (iPhos) capable of delivering messenger RNA or mRNA/single-guide RNA for gene editing in vivo. Optimized iPhos lipids are composed of one pH-switchable zwitterion and three hydrophobic tails, which adopt a cone shape in endosomal acidic environments to facilitate membrane hexagonal transformation and subsequent cargo release from endosomes. Structure–activity relationships reveal that iPhos chemical structure can control in vivo efficacy and organ selectivity. iPhos lipids synergistically function with various helper lipids to formulate multi-component lipid nanoparticles (called iPLNPs) for selective organ targeting. Zwitterionic, ionizable cationic and permanently cationic helper lipids enable tissue-selective mRNA delivery and CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing in spleen, liver and lungs (respectively) following intravenous administration. This rational design of functional phospholipids demonstrates substantial value for gene editing research and therapeutic applications."
185,High-strength scalable graphene sheets by freezing stretch-induced alignment,2021-02-04,"Efforts to obtain high-strength graphene sheets by near-room-temperature assembly have been frustrated by the misalignment of graphene layers, which degrades mechanical properties. While in-plane stretching can decrease this misalignment, it reappears when releasing the stretch. Here we use covalent and π–π inter-platelet bridging to permanently freeze stretch-induced alignment of graphene sheets, and thereby increase isotropic in-plane sheet strength to 1.55 GPa, in combination with a high Young’s modulus, electrical conductivity and weight-normalized shielding efficiency. Moreover, the stretch-bridged graphene sheets are scalable and can be easily bonded together using a commercial resin without appreciably decreasing the performance, which establishes the potential for practical applications."
186,Autonomous snapping and jumping polymer gels,2021-02-01,"Snap-through buckling is commonly used in nature for power-amplified movements. While natural examples such as Utricularia and Dionaea muscipula can autonomously reset their snapping structures, bio-inspired analogues require external mediation for sequential snap events. Here we report the design principles for self-repeating, snap-based polymer jumping devices. Transient shape changes during the drying of a polymer gel are exploited to generate mechanical constraint and an internal driving force for snap-through buckling. Snap-induced shape changes alter environmental interactions to realize multiple, self-repeating snap events. The underlying mechanisms are understood through controlled experiments and numerical modelling. Using these lessons, we create snap-induced jumping devices with power density outputs (specific power ≈ 312 W kg−1) that are similar to high-performing jumping organisms and engineered robots. These results provide the demonstration of an autonomous, self-repeating, high-speed movement, marking an important advance in the development of environmental energy harvesting, high-power motion that is important for microscale robots and actuated devices."
187,Tuning surface ,2021-01-28,"Understanding chemical bonding and conductivity at the electrode–molecule interface is key for the operation of single-molecule junctions. Here we apply the d-band theory that describes interfacial interactions between adsorbates and transition metal surfaces to study electron transport across these devices. We realized bimetallic Au electrodes modified with a monoatomic Ag adlayer to connect α,ω-alkanoic acids (HO2C(CH2)nCO2H). The force required to break the molecule–electrode binding and the contact conductance Gn=0 are 1.1 nN and 0.29 G0 (the conductance quantum, 1 G0 = 2e2/h ≈ 77.5 μS), which makes these junctions, respectively, 1.3–1.8 times stronger and 40–60-fold more conductive than junctions with bare Au or Ag electrodes. A similar performance was found for Au electrodes modified by Cu monolayers. By integrating the Newns–Anderson model with the Hammer–Nørskov d-band model, we explain how the surface d bands strengthen the adsorption and promote interfacial electron transport, which provides an alternative avenue for the optimization of molecular electronic devices."
188,Spontaneous organization of supracolloids into three-dimensional structured materials,2021-01-28,"Periodic nano- or microscale structures are used to control light, energy and mass transportation. Colloidal organization is the most versatile method used to control nano- and microscale order, and employs either the enthalpy-driven self-assembly of particles at a low concentration or the entropy-driven packing of particles at a high concentration. Nonetheless, it cannot yet provide the spontaneous three-dimensional organization of multicomponent particles at a high concentration. Here we combined these two concepts into a single strategy to achieve hierarchical multicomponent materials. We tuned the electrostatic attraction between polymer and silica nanoparticles to create dynamic supracolloids whose components, on drying, reorganize by entropy into three-dimensional structured materials. Cryogenic electron tomography reveals the kinetic pathways, whereas Monte Carlo simulations combined with a kinetic model provide design rules to form the supracolloids and control the kinetic pathways. This approach may be useful to fabricate hierarchical hybrid materials for distinct technological applications."
189,Non-contact long-range magnetic stimulation of mechanosensitive ion channels in freely moving animals,2021-01-28,"Among physical stimulation modalities, magnetism has clear advantages, such as deep penetration and untethered interventions in biological subjects. However, some of the working principles and effectiveness of existing magnetic neurostimulation approaches have been challenged, leaving questions to be answered. Here we introduce m-Torquer, a magnetic toolkit that mimics magnetoreception in nature. It comprises a nanoscale magnetic torque actuator and a circular magnet array, which deliver piconewton-scale forces to cells over a working range of ~70 cm. With m-Torquer, stimulation of neurons expressing bona fide mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 enables consistent and reproducible neuromodulation in freely moving mice. With its long working distance and cellular targeting capability, m-Torquer provides versatility in its use, which can range from single cells to in vivo systems, with the potential application in large animals such as primates."
190,Linking void and interphase evolution to electrochemistry in solid-state batteries using operando X-ray tomography,2021-01-28,"Despite progress in solid-state battery engineering, our understanding of the chemo-mechanical phenomena that govern electrochemical behaviour and stability at solid–solid interfaces remains limited compared to at solid–liquid interfaces. Here, we use operando synchrotron X-ray computed microtomography to investigate the evolution of lithium/solid-state electrolyte interfaces during battery cycling, revealing how the complex interplay among void formation, interphase growth and volumetric changes determines cell behaviour. Void formation during lithium stripping is directly visualized in symmetric cells, and the loss of contact that drives current constriction at the interface between lithium and the solid-state electrolyte (Li10SnP2S12) is quantified and found to be the primary cause of cell failure. The interphase is found to be redox-active upon charge, and global volume changes occur owing to partial molar volume mismatches at either electrode. These results provide insight into how chemo-mechanical phenomena can affect cell performance, thus facilitating the development of solid-state batteries."
191,Kinetically stabilized ferroelectricity in bulk single-crystalline HfO,2021-01-25,"HfO2, a simple binary oxide, exhibits ultra-scalable ferroelectricity integrable into silicon technology. This material has a polymorphic nature, with the polar orthorhombic (Pbc21) form in ultrathin films regarded as the plausible cause of ferroelectricity but thought not to be attainable in bulk crystals. Here, using a state-of-the-art laser-diode-heated floating zone technique, we report the Pbc21 phase and ferroelectricity in bulk single-crystalline HfO2:Y as well as the presence of the antipolar Pbca phase at different Y concentrations. Neutron diffraction and atomic imaging demonstrate (anti)polar crystallographic signatures and abundant 90°/180° ferroelectric domains in addition to switchable polarization with negligible wake-up effects. Density-functional-theory calculations indicate that the yttrium doping and rapid cooling are the key factors for stabilization of the desired phase in bulk. Our observations provide insights into the polymorphic nature and phase control of HfO2, remove the upper size limit for ferroelectricity and suggest directions towards next-generation ferroelectric devices."
192,Room-temperature antiskyrmions and sawtooth surface textures in a non-centrosymmetric magnet with ,2021-01-25,"Topological spin textures have attracted much attention both for fundamental physics and spintronics applications. Among them, antiskyrmions possess a unique spin configuration with Bloch-type and Néel-type domain walls owing to anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction in the non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. However, antiskyrmions have thus far only been observed in a few Heusler compounds with D2d symmetry. Here we report a new material, Fe1.9Ni0.9Pd0.2P, in a different symmetry class (S4), in which antiskyrmions exist over a wide temperature range that includes room temperature, and transform into skyrmions on changing magnetic field and lamella thickness. The periodicity of magnetic textures greatly depends on the crystal thickness, and domains with anisotropic sawtooth fractals were observed at the surface of thick crystals and attributed to the interplay between the dipolar interaction and the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction as governed by crystal symmetry. Our findings provide an arena in which to study antiskyrmions, and should stimulate further research on topological spin textures and their applications."
193,Basement membrane stiffness determines metastases formation,2021-01-25,"The basement membrane (BM) is a special type of extracellular matrix and presents the major barrier cancer cells have to overcome multiple times to form metastases. Here we show that BM stiffness is a major determinant of metastases formation in several tissues and identify netrin-4 (Net4) as a key regulator of BM stiffness. Mechanistically, our biophysical and functional analyses in combination with mathematical simulations show that Net4 softens the mechanical properties of native BMs by opening laminin node complexes, decreasing cancer cell potential to transmigrate this barrier despite creating bigger pores. Our results therefore reveal that BM stiffness is dominant over pore size, and that the mechanical properties of ‘normal’ BMs determine metastases formation and patient survival independent of cancer-mediated alterations. Thus, identifying individual Net4 protein levels within native BMs in major metastatic organs may have the potential to define patient survival even before tumour formation. The ratio of Net4 to laminin molecules determines BM stiffness, such that the more Net4, the softer the BM, thereby decreasing cancer cell invasion activity."
194,Creation of moiré bands in a monolayer semiconductor by spatially periodic dielectric screening,2021-01-21,"Moiré superlattices of two-dimensional van der Waals materials have emerged as a powerful platform for designing electronic band structures and discovering emergent physical phenomena. A key concept involves the creation of long-wavelength periodic potential and moiré bands in a crystal through interlayer electronic hybridization or atomic corrugation when two materials are overlaid. Here we demonstrate a new approach based on spatially periodic dielectric screening to create moiré bands in a monolayer semiconductor. This approach relies on reduced dielectric screening of the Coulomb interactions in monolayer semiconductors and their environmental dielectric-dependent electronic band structure. We observe optical transitions between moiré bands in monolayer WSe2 when it is placed close to small-angle-misaligned graphene on hexagonal boron nitride. The moiré bands are a result of long-range Coulomb interactions, which are strongly gate tunable, and can have versatile superlattice symmetries independent of the crystal lattice of the host material. Our result also demonstrates that monolayer semiconductors are sensitive local dielectric sensors."
195,Revisiting metal fluorides as lithium-ion battery cathodes,2021-01-21,"Metal fluorides, promising lithium-ion battery cathode materials, have been classified as conversion materials due to the reconstructive phase transitions widely presumed to occur upon lithiation. We challenge this view by studying FeF3 using X-ray total scattering and electron diffraction techniques that measure structure over multiple length scales coupled with density functional theory calculations, and by revisiting prior experimental studies of FeF2 and CuF2. Metal fluoride lithiation is instead dominated by diffusion-controlled displacement mechanisms, and a clear topological relationship between the metal fluoride F− sublattices and that of LiF is established. Initial lithiation of FeF3 forms FeF2 on the particle’s surface, along with a cation-ordered and stacking-disordered phase, A-LixFeyF3, which is structurally related to α-/β-LiMn2+Fe3+F6 and which topotactically transforms to B- and then C-LixFeyF3, before forming LiF and Fe. Lithiation of FeF2 and CuF2 results in a buffer phase between FeF2/CuF2 and LiF. The resulting principles will aid future developments of a wider range of isomorphic metal fluorides."
196,Self-repair protects microtubules from destruction by molecular motors,2021-01-21,"Microtubule instability stems from the low energy of tubulin dimer interactions, which sets the growing polymer close to its disassembly conditions. Molecular motors use ATP hydrolysis to produce mechanical work and move on microtubules. This raises the possibility that the mechanical work produced by walking motors can break dimer interactions and trigger microtubule disassembly. We tested this hypothesis by studying the interplay between microtubules and moving molecular motors in vitro. Our results show that molecular motors can remove tubulin dimers from the lattice and rapidly destroy microtubules. We also found that dimer removal by motors was compensated for by the insertion of free tubulin dimers into the microtubule lattice. This self-repair mechanism allows microtubules to survive the damage induced by molecular motors as they move along their tracks. Our study reveals the existence of coupling between the motion of molecular motors and the renewal of the microtubule lattice."
197,Tuning spin excitations in magnetic films by confinement,2021-01-18,"Spin excitations of magnetic thin films are the founding element for magnetic devices in general. While spin dynamics have been extensively studied in bulk materials, the behaviour in mesoscopic films is less known due to experimental limitations. Here, we employ resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to investigate the spectrum of spin excitations in mesoscopic Fe films, from bulk-like films down to three unit cells. In bulk samples, we find isotropic, dispersive ferromagnons consistent with previous neutron scattering results for bulk single crystals. As the thickness is reduced, these ferromagnetic spin excitations renormalize to lower energies along the out-of-plane direction while retaining their dispersion in the in-plane direction. This thickness dependence is captured by simple Heisenberg model calculations accounting for the confinement in the out-of-plane direction through the loss of Fe bonds. Our findings highlight the effects of mesoscopic scaling on spin dynamics and identify thickness as a knob for fine tuning and controlling magnetic properties."
198,Highly luminescent and catalytically active suprastructures of magic-sized semiconductor nanoclusters,2021-01-18,"Metal chalcogenide magic-sized nanoclusters have shown intriguing photophysical and chemical properties, yet ambient instability has hampered their extensive applications. Here we explore the periodic assembly of these nanoscale building blocks through organic linkers to overcome such limitations and further boost their properties. We designed a diamine-based heat-up self-assembly process to assemble Mn2+:(CdSe)13 and Mn2+:(ZnSe)13 magic-sized nanoclusters into three- and two-dimensional suprastructures, respectively, obtaining enhanced stability and solid-state photoluminescence quantum yields (from <1% for monoamine-based systems to ~72% for diamine-based suprastructures). We also exploited the atomic-level miscibility of Cd and Zn to synthesize Mn2+:(Cd1−xZnxSe)13 alloy suprastructures with tunable metal synergy: Mn2+:(Cd0.5Zn0.5Se)13 suprastructures demonstrated high catalytic activity (turnover number, 17,964 per cluster in 6 h; turnover frequency, 2,994 per cluster per hour) for converting CO2 to organic cyclic carbonates under mild reaction conditions. The enhanced stability, photoluminescence and catalytic activity through combined cluster-assembly and metal synergy advance the usability of inorganic semiconductor nanoclusters."
199,A light-induced phononic symmetry switch and giant dissipationless topological photocurrent in ZrTe,2021-01-18,"Dissipationless currents from topologically protected states are promising for disorder-tolerant electronics and quantum computation. Here, we photogenerate giant anisotropic terahertz nonlinear currents with vanishing scattering, driven by laser-induced coherent phonons of broken inversion symmetry in a centrosymmetric Dirac material ZrTe5. Our work suggests that this phononic terahertz symmetry switching leads to formation of Weyl points, whose chirality manifests in a transverse, helicity-dependent current, orthogonal to the dynamical inversion symmetry breaking axis, via circular photogalvanic effect. The temperature-dependent topological photocurrent exhibits several distinct features: Berry curvature dominance, particle–hole reversal near conical points and chirality protection that is responsible for an exceptional ballistic transport length of ~10 μm. These results, together with first-principles modelling, indicate two pairs of Weyl points dynamically created by B1u phonons of broken inversion symmetry. Such phononic terahertz control breaks ground for coherent manipulation of Weyl nodes and robust quantum transport without application of static electric or magnetic fields."
200,Direct imaging of atomistic grain boundary migration,2021-01-11,"Grain boundary (GB) migration plays an important role in modifying the microstructures and the related properties of polycrystalline materials, and is governed by the atomistic mechanism by which the atoms are displaced from one grain to another. Although such an atomistic mechanism has been intensively investigated, it is still experimentally unclear as to how the GB migration proceeds at the atomic scale. With the aid of high-energy electron-beam irradiation in atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, we controllably triggered the GB migration in α-Al2O3 and directly visualized the atomistic GB migration as a stop motion movie. It was revealed that the GB migration proceeds by the cooperative shuffling of atoms on GB ledges along specific routes, passing through several different stable and metastable GB structures with low energies. We demonstrated that GB migration could be facilitated by the GB structural transformations between these low-energy structures."
201,Living materials with programmable functionalities grown from engineered microbial co-cultures,2021-01-11,"Biological systems assemble living materials that are autonomously patterned, can self-repair and can sense and respond to their environment. The field of engineered living materials aims to create novel materials with properties similar to those of natural biomaterials using genetically engineered organisms. Here, we describe an approach to fabricating functional bacterial cellulose-based living materials using a stable co-culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast and bacterial cellulose-producing Komagataeibacter rhaeticus bacteria. Yeast strains can be engineered to secrete enzymes into bacterial cellulose, generating autonomously grown catalytic materials and enabling DNA-encoded modification of bacterial cellulose bulk properties. Alternatively, engineered yeast can be incorporated within the growing cellulose matrix, creating living materials that can sense and respond to chemical and optical stimuli. This symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast is a flexible platform for the production of bacterial cellulose-based engineered living materials with potential applications in biosensing and biocatalysis."
202,Tuning electrochemically driven surface transformation in atomically flat LaNiO,2021-01-11,"Structure–activity relationships built on descriptors of bulk and bulk-terminated surfaces are the basis for the rational design of electrocatalysts. However, electrochemically driven surface transformations complicate the identification of such descriptors. Here we demonstrate how the as-prepared surface composition of (001)-terminated LaNiO3 epitaxial thin films dictates the surface transformation and the electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. Specifically, the Ni termination (in the as-prepared state) is considerably more active than the La termination, with overpotential differences of up to 150 mV. A combined electrochemical, spectroscopic and density-functional theory investigation suggests that this activity trend originates from a thermodynamically stable, disordered NiO2 surface layer that forms during the operation of Ni-terminated surfaces, which is kinetically inaccessible when starting with a La termination. Our work thus demonstrates the tunability of surface transformation pathways by modifying a single atomic layer at the surface and that active surface phases only develop for select as-synthesized surface terminations."
203,A molecular interaction–diffusion framework for predicting organic solar cell stability,2021-01-11,"Rapid increase in the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs) has been achieved with the development of non-fullerene small-molecule acceptors (NF-SMAs). Although the morphological stability of these NF-SMA devices critically affects their intrinsic lifetime, their fundamental intermolecular interactions and how they govern property–function relations and morphological stability of OSCs remain elusive. Here, we discover that the diffusion of an NF-SMA into the donor polymer exhibits Arrhenius behaviour and that the activation energy Ea scales linearly with the enthalpic interaction parameters χH between the polymer and the NF-SMA. Consequently, the thermodynamically most unstable, hypo-miscible systems (high χ) are the most kinetically stabilized. We relate the differences in Ea to measured and selectively simulated molecular self-interaction properties of the constituent materials and develop quantitative property–function relations that link thermal and mechanical characteristics of the NF-SMA and polymer to predict relative diffusion properties and thus morphological stability."
204,Linking in situ charge accumulation to electronic structure in doped SrTiO,2021-01-11,"Recently, high solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies were demonstrated using La and Rh co-doped SrTiO3 (La,Rh:SrTiO3) incorporated into a low-cost and scalable Z-scheme device, known as a photocatalyst sheet. However, the unique properties that enable La,Rh:SrTiO3 to support this impressive performance are not fully understood. Combining in situ spectroelectrochemical measurements with density functional theory and photoelectron spectroscopy produces a depletion model of Rh:SrTiO3 and La,Rh:SrTiO3 photocatalyst sheets. This reveals remarkable properties, such as deep flatband potentials (+2 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) and a Rh oxidation state dependent reorganization of the electronic structure, involving the loss of a vacant Rh 4d mid-gap state. This reorganization enables Rh:SrTiO3 to be reduced by co-doping without compromising the p-type character. In situ time-resolved spectroscopies show that the electronic structure reorganization induced by Rh reduction controls the electron lifetime in photocatalyst sheets. In Rh:SrTiO3, enhanced lifetimes can only be obtained at negative applied potentials, where the complete Z-scheme operates inefficiently. La co-doping fixes Rh in the 3+ state, which results in long-lived photogenerated electrons even at very positive potentials (+1 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode), in which both components of the complete device operate effectively. This understanding of the role of co-dopants provides a new insight into the design principles for water-splitting devices based on bandgap-engineered metal oxides."
205,Unlocking anionic redox activity in O3-type sodium 3,2021-01-11,"Sodium ion batteries, because of their sustainability attributes, could be an attractive alternative to Li-ion technology for specific applications. However, it remains challenging to design high energy density and moisture stable Na-based positive electrodes. Here, we report an O3-type NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 phase showing anionic redox activity, obtained through a ceramic process by carefully adjusting synthesis conditions and stoichiometry. This phase shows a sustained reversible capacity of 190 mAh g−1 that is rooted in cumulative oxygen and manganese redox processes as deduced by combined spectroscopy techniques. Unlike many other anionic redox layered oxides so far reported, O3-NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 electrodes do not show discernible voltage fade on cycling. This finding, rationalized by density functional theory, sheds light on the role of inter- versus intralayer 3d cationic migration in ruling voltage fade in anionic redox electrodes. Another practical asset of this material stems from its moisture stability, hence facilitating its handling and electrode processing. Overall, this work offers future directions towards designing highly performing sodium electrodes for advanced Na-ion batteries."
206,Metal–ferroelectric supercrystals with periodically curved metallic layers,2021-01-04,"Simultaneous manipulation of multiple boundary conditions in nanoscale heterostructures offers a versatile route to stabilizing unusual structures and emergent phases. Here, we show that a stable supercrystal phase comprising a three-dimensional ordering of nanoscale domains with tailored periodicities can be engineered in PbTiO3–SrRuO3 ferroelectric–metal superlattices. A combination of laboratory and synchrotron X-ray diffraction, piezoresponse force microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy and phase-field simulations reveals a complex hierarchical domain structure that forms to minimize the elastic and electrostatic energy. Large local deformations of the ferroelectric lattice are accommodated by periodic lattice modulations of the metallic SrRuO3 layers with curvatures up to 107 m−1. Our results show that multidomain ferroelectric systems can be exploited as versatile templates to induce large curvatures in correlated materials, and present a route for engineering correlated materials with modulated structural and electronic properties that can be controlled using electric fields."
207,Evidence for a higher-order topological insulator in a three-dimensional material built from van der Waals stacking of bismuth-halide chains,2021-01-04,"Low-dimensional van der Waals materials have been extensively studied as a platform with which to generate quantum effects. Advancing this research, topological quantum materials with van der Waals structures are currently receiving a great deal of attention. Here, we use the concept of designing topological materials by the van der Waals stacking of quantum spin Hall insulators. Most interestingly, we find that a slight shift of inversion centre in the unit cell caused by a modification of stacking induces a transition from a trivial insulator to a higher-order topological insulator. Based on this, we present angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy results showing that the real three-dimensional material Bi4Br4 is a higher-order topological insulator. Our demonstration that various topological states can be selected by stacking chains differently, combined with the advantages of van der Waals materials, offers a playground for engineering topologically non-trivial edge states towards future spintronics applications."
208,Hydrogen-doped viscoplastic liquid metal microparticles for stretchable printed metal lines,2021-01-04,"Conductive and stretchable electrodes that can be printed directly on a stretchable substrate have drawn extensive attention for wearable electronics and electronic skins. Printable inks that contain liquid metal are strong candidates for these applications, but the insulating oxide skin that forms around the liquid metal particles limits their conductivity. This study reveals that hydrogen doping introduced by ultrasonication in the presence of aliphatic polymers makes the oxide skin highly conductive and deformable. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atom probe tomography confirmed the hydrogen doping, and first-principles calculations were used to rationalize the obtained conductivity. The printed circuit lines show a metallic conductivity (25,000 S cm–1), excellent electromechanical decoupling at a 500% uniaxial stretching, mechanical resistance to scratches and long-term stability in wide ranges of temperature and humidity. The self-passivation of the printed lines allows the direct printing of three-dimensional circuit lines and double-layer planar coils that are used as stretchable inductive strain sensors."
209,n-type charge transport in heavily p-doped polymers,2021-01-04,"It is commonly assumed that charge-carrier transport in doped π-conjugated polymers is dominated by one type of charge carrier, either holes or electrons, as determined by the chemistry of the dopant. Here, through Seebeck coefficient and Hall effect measurements, we show that mobile electrons contribute substantially to charge-carrier transport in π-conjugated polymers that are heavily p-doped with strong electron acceptors. Specifically, the Seebeck coefficient of several p-doped polymers changes sign from positive to negative as the concentration of the oxidizing agents FeCl3 or NOBF4 increase, and Hall effect measurements for the same p-doped polymers reveal that electrons become the dominant delocalized charge carriers. Ultraviolet and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy measurements show that doping with oxidizing agents results in elimination of the transport gap at high doping concentrations. This approach of heavy p-type doping is demonstrated to provide a promising route to high-performance n-type organic thermoelectric materials."
210,Dynamic multimodal holograms of conjugated organogels via dithering mask lithography,2021-01-04,"Polymeric materials have been used to realize optical systems that, through periodic variations of their structural or optical properties, interact with light-generating holographic signals. Complex holographic systems can also be dynamically controlled through exposure to external stimuli, yet they usually contain only a single type of holographic mode. Here, we report a conjugated organogel that reversibly displays three modes of holograms in a single architecture. Using dithering mask lithography, we realized two-dimensional patterns with varying cross-linking densities on a conjugated polydiacetylene. In protic solvents, the organogel contracts anisotropically to develop optical and structural heterogeneities along the third dimension, displaying holograms in the form of three-dimensional full parallax signals, both in fluorescence and bright-field microscopy imaging. In aprotic solvents, these heterogeneities diminish as organogels expand, recovering the two-dimensional periodicity to display a third hologram mode based on iridescent structural colours. Our study presents a next-generation hologram manufacturing method for multilevel encryption technologies."
211,Excitons in a reconstructed moiré potential in twisted WSe,2021-01-04,"Moiré superlattices in twisted van der Waals materials have recently emerged as a promising platform for engineering electronic and optical properties. A major obstacle to fully understanding these systems and harnessing their potential is the limited ability to correlate direct imaging of the moiré structure with optical and electronic properties. Here we develop a secondary electron microscope technique to directly image stacking domains in fully functional van der Waals heterostructure devices. After demonstrating the imaging of AB/BA and ABA/ABC domains in multilayer graphene, we employ this technique to investigate reconstructed moiré patterns in twisted WSe2/WSe2 bilayers and directly correlate the increasing moiré periodicity with the emergence of two distinct exciton species in photoluminescence measurements. These states can be tuned individually through electrostatic gating and feature different valley coherence properties. We attribute our observations to the formation of an array of two intralayer exciton species that reside in alternating locations in the superlattice, and open up new avenues to realize tunable exciton arrays in twisted van der Waals heterostructures, with applications in quantum optoelectronics and explorations of novel many-body systems."
212,Conjugated sulfonamides as a class of organic lithium-ion positive electrodes,2020-12-14,"The applicability of organic battery materials in conventional rocking-chair lithium (Li)-ion cells remains deeply challenged by the lack of Li-containing and air-stable organic positive electrode chemistries. Decades of experimental and theoretical research in the field has resulted in only a few recent examples of Li-reservoir materials, all of which rely on the archetypal conjugated carbonyl redox chemistry. Here we extend the chemical space of organic Li-ion positive electrode materials with a class of conjugated sulfonamides (CSAs) and show that the electron delocalization on the sulfonyl groups endows the resulting CSAs with intrinsic oxidation and hydrolysis resistance when handled in ambient air, and yet display reversible electrochemistry for charge storage. The formal redox potential of the uncovered CSA chemistries spans a wide range between 2.85 V and 3.45 V (versus Li+/Li0), finely tunable through electrostatic or inductive molecular design. This class of organic Li-ion positive electrode materials challenges the realm of the inorganic battery cathode, as this first generation of CSA chemistries already displays gravimetric energy storage metrics comparable to those of the stereotypical LiFePO4."
213,Synergistically integrated phosphonated poly(pentafluorostyrene) for fuel cells,2020-12-07,"Modern electrochemical energy conversion devices require more advanced proton conductors for their broad applications. Phosphonated polymers have been proposed as anhydrous proton conductors for fuel cells. However, the anhydride formation of phosphonic acid functional groups lowers proton conductivity and this prevents the use of phosphonated polymers in fuel cell applications. Here, we report a poly(2,3,5,6-tetrafluorostyrene-4-phosphonic acid) that does not undergo anhydride formation and thus maintains protonic conductivity above 200 °C. We use the phosphonated polymer in fuel cell electrodes with an ion-pair coordinated membrane in a membrane electrode assembly. This synergistically integrated fuel cell reached peak power densities of 1,130 mW cm−2 at 160 °C and 1,740 mW cm−2 at 240 °C under H2/O2 conditions, substantially outperforming polybenzimidazole- and metal phosphate-based fuel cells. Our result indicates a pathway towards using phosphonated polymers in high-performance fuel cells under hot and dry operating conditions."
214,Tumour-associated macrophages drive stromal cell-dependent collagen crosslinking and stiffening to promote breast cancer aggression,2020-11-30,"Stromal stiffening accompanies malignancy, compromises treatment and promotes tumour aggression. Clarifying the molecular nature and the factors that regulate stromal stiffening in tumours should identify biomarkers to stratify patients for therapy and interventions to improve outcome. We profiled lysyl hydroxylase-mediated and lysyl oxidase-mediated collagen crosslinks and quantified the greatest abundance of total and complex collagen crosslinks in aggressive human breast cancer subtypes with the stiffest stroma. These tissues harbour the highest number of tumour-associated macrophages, whose therapeutic ablation in experimental models reduced metastasis, and decreased collagen crosslinks and stromal stiffening. Epithelial-targeted expression of the crosslinking enzyme, lysyl oxidase, had no impact on collagen crosslinking in PyMT mammary tumours, whereas stromal cell targeting did. Stromal cells in microdissected human tumours expressed the highest level of collagen crosslinking enzymes. Immunohistochemical analysis of biopsies from a cohort of patients with breast cancer revealed that stromal expression of lysyl hydroxylase 2, an enzyme that induces hydroxylysine aldehyde-derived collagen crosslinks and stromal stiffening, correlated significantly with disease specific mortality. The findings link tissue inflammation, stromal cell-mediated collagen crosslinking and stiffening to tumour aggression and identify lysyl hydroxylase 2 as a stromal biomarker."
215,Cofactor-free oxidase-mimetic nanomaterials from self-assembled histidine-rich peptides,2020-11-30,"Natural oxidases mainly rely on cofactors and well-arranged amino acid residues for catalysing electron-transfer reactions but suffer from non-recovery of their activity upon externally induced protein unfolding. However, it remains unknown whether residues at the active site can catalyse similar reactions in the absence of the cofactor. Here, we describe a series of self-assembling, histidine-rich peptides, as short as a dipeptide, with catalytic function similar to that of haem-dependent peroxidases. The histidine residues of the peptide chains form periodic arrays that are able to catalyse H2O2 reduction reactions efficiently through the formation of reactive ternary complex intermediates. The supramolecular catalyst exhibiting the highest activity could be switched between inactive and active states without loss of activity for ten cycles of heating/cooling or acidification/neutralization treatments, demonstrating the reversible assembly/disassembly of the active residues. These findings may aid the design of advanced biomimetic catalytic materials and provide a model for primitive cofactor-free enzymes."
216,Cellular extrusion bioprinting improves kidney organoid reproducibility and conformation,2020-11-23,"Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to kidney organoids brings the prospect of drug screening, disease modelling and the generation of tissue for renal replacement. Currently, these applications are hampered by organoid variability, nephron immaturity, low throughput and limited scale. Here, we apply extrusion-based three-dimensional cellular bioprinting to deliver rapid and high-throughput generation of kidney organoids with highly reproducible cell number and viability. We demonstrate that manual organoid generation can be replaced by 6- or 96-well organoid bioprinting and evaluate the relative toxicity of aminoglycosides as a proof of concept for drug testing. In addition, three-dimensional bioprinting enables precise manipulation of biophysical properties, including organoid size, cell number and conformation, with modification of organoid conformation substantially increasing nephron yield per starting cell number. This facilitates the manufacture of uniformly patterned kidney tissue sheets with functional proximal tubular segments. Hence, automated extrusion-based bioprinting for kidney organoid production delivers improvements in throughput, quality control, scale and structure, facilitating in vitro and in vivo applications of stem cell-derived human kidney tissue."
217,Atomically precise single-crystal structures of electrically conducting 2D metal–organic frameworks,2020-11-23,"Electrically conducting 2D metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted considerable interest, as their hexagonal 2D lattices mimic graphite and other 2D van der Waals stacked materials. However, understanding their intrinsic properties remains a challenge because their crystals are too small or of too poor quality for crystal structure determination. Here, we report atomically precise structures of a family of 2D π-conjugated MOFs derived from large single crystals of sizes up to 200 μm, allowing atomic-resolution analysis by a battery of high-resolution diffraction techniques. A designed ligand core rebalances the in-plane and out-of-plane interactions that define anisotropic crystal growth. We report two crystal structure types exhibiting analogous 2D honeycomb-like sheets but distinct packing modes and pore contents. Single-crystal electrical transport measurements distinctively demonstrate anisotropic transport normal and parallel to the π-conjugated sheets, revealing a clear correlation between absolute conductivity and the nature of the metal cation and 2D sheet packing motif."
218,Activating an adaptive immune response from a hydrogel scaffold imparts regenerative wound healing,2020-11-09,"Microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds are flowable, in situ crosslinked, microporous scaffolds composed of microgel building blocks and were previously shown to accelerate wound healing. To promote more extensive tissue ingrowth before scaffold degradation, we aimed to slow MAP degradation by switching the chirality of the crosslinking peptides from l- to d-amino acids. Unexpectedly, despite showing the predicted slower enzymatic degradation in vitro, d-peptide crosslinked MAP hydrogel (d-MAP) hastened material degradation in vivo and imparted significant tissue regeneration to healed cutaneous wounds, including increased tensile strength and hair neogenesis. MAP scaffolds recruit IL-33 type 2 myeloid cells, which is amplified in the presence of d-peptides. Remarkably, d-MAP elicited significant antigen-specific immunity against the d-chiral peptides, and an intact adaptive immune system was required for the hydrogel-induced skin regeneration. These findings demonstrate that the generation of an adaptive immune response from a biomaterial is sufficient to induce cutaneous regenerative healing despite faster scaffold degradation."
219,Identifying carbon as the source of visible single-photon emission from hexagonal boron nitride,2020-11-02,"Single-photon emitters (SPEs) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have garnered increasing attention over the last few years due to their superior optical properties. However, despite the vast range of experimental results and theoretical calculations, the defect structure responsible for the observed emission has remained elusive. Here, by controlling the incorporation of impurities into hBN via various bottom-up synthesis methods and directly through ion implantation, we provide direct evidence that the visible SPEs are carbon related. Room-temperature optically detected magnetic resonance is demonstrated on ensembles of these defects. We perform ion-implantation experiments and confirm that only carbon implantation creates SPEs in the visible spectral range. Computational analysis of the simplest 12 carbon-containing defect species suggest the negatively charged \({\rm{V}}_{\rm{B}}{\rm{C}}_{\rm{N}}^ -\) defect as a viable candidate and predict that out-of-plane deformations make the defect environmentally sensitive. Our results resolve a long-standing debate about the origin of single emitters at the visible range in hBN and will be key to the deterministic engineering of these defects for quantum photonic devices."
220,Endothermic reaction at room temperature enabled by deep-ultraviolet plasmons,2020-11-02,"Metallic nanoparticles have been used to harvest energy from a light source and transfer it to adsorbed gas molecules, which results in a reduced chemical reaction temperature. However, most reported reactions, such as ethylene epoxidation, ammonia decomposition and H–D bond formation are exothermic, and only H–D bond formation has been achieved at room temperature. These reactions require low activation energies (<2 eV), which are readily attained using visible-frequency localized surface plasmons (from ~1.75 eV to ~3.1 eV). Here, we show that endothermic reactions that require higher activation energy (>3.1 eV) can be initiated at room temperature by using localized surface plasmons in the deep-UV range. As an example, by leveraging simultaneous excitation of multiple localized surface plasmon modes of Al nanoparticles by using high-energy electrons, we initiate the reduction of CO2 to CO by carbon at room temperature. We employ an environmental transmission electron microscope to excite and characterize Al localized surface plasmon resonances, and simultaneously measure the spatial distribution of carbon gasification near the nanoparticles in a CO2 environment. This approach opens a path towards exploring other industrially relevant chemical processes that are initiated by plasmonic fields at room temperature."
221,Printable two-dimensional superconducting monolayers,2020-10-26,"Two-dimensional superconductor (2DSC) monolayers with non-centrosymmetry exhibit unconventional Ising pair superconductivity and an enhanced upper critical field beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit, driving intense research interest. However, they are often susceptible to structural disorder and environmental oxidation, which destroy electronic coherence and provide technical challenges in the creation of artificial van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) for devices. Herein, we report a general and scalable synthesis of highly crystalline 2DSC monolayers via a mild electrochemical exfoliation method using flexible organic ammonium cations solvated with neutral solvent molecules as co-intercalants. Using NbSe2 as a model system, we achieved a high yield (>75%) of large-sized single-crystal monolayers up to 300 µm. The as-fabricated, twisted NbSe2 vdWHs demonstrate high stability, good interfacial properties and a critical current that is modulated by magnetic field when one flux quantum fits to an integer number of moiré cells. Additionally, formulated 2DSC inks can be exploited to fabricate wafer-scale 2D superconducting wire arrays and three-dimensional superconducting composites with desirable morphologies."
222,Direct X-ray and electron-beam lithography of halogenated zeolitic imidazolate frameworks,2020-10-26,"Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) offer disruptive potential in micro- and optoelectronics because of the unique properties of these microporous materials. Nanoscale patterning is a fundamental step in the implementation of MOFs in miniaturized solid-state devices. Conventional MOF patterning methods suffer from low resolution and poorly defined pattern edges. Here, we demonstrate the resist-free, direct X-ray and electron-beam lithography of MOFs. This process avoids etching damage and contamination and leaves the porosity and crystallinity of the patterned MOFs intact. The resulting high-quality patterns have excellent sub-50-nm resolution, and approach the mesopore regime. The compatibility of X-ray and electron-beam lithography with existing micro- and nanofabrication processes will facilitate the integration of MOFs in miniaturized devices."
223,Intrinsic efficiency limits in low-bandgap non-fullerene acceptor organic solar cells,2020-10-23,"In bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) both the electron affinity (EA) and ionization energy (IE) offsets at the donor–acceptor interface should equally control exciton dissociation. Here, we demonstrate that in low-bandgap non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) BHJs ultrafast donor-to-acceptor energy transfer precedes hole transfer from the acceptor to the donor and thus renders the EA offset virtually unimportant. Moreover, sizeable bulk IE offsets of about 0.5 eV are needed for efficient charge transfer and high internal quantum efficiencies, since energy level bending at the donor–NFA interface caused by the acceptors’ quadrupole moments prevents efficient exciton-to-charge-transfer state conversion at low IE offsets. The same bending, however, is the origin of the barrier-less charge transfer state to free charge conversion. Our results provide a comprehensive picture of the photophysics of NFA-based blends, and show that sizeable bulk IE offsets are essential to design efficient BHJ OSCs based on low-bandgap NFAs."
224,Stress fibres are embedded in a contractile cortical network,2020-10-19,"Contractile actomyosin networks are responsible for the production of intracellular forces. There is increasing evidence that bundles of actin filaments form interconnected and interconvertible structures with the rest of the network. In this study, we explored the mechanical impact of these interconnections on the production and distribution of traction forces throughout the cell. By using a combination of hydrogel micropatterning, traction force microscopy and laser photoablation, we measured the relaxation of traction forces in response to local photoablations. Our experimental results and modelling of the mechanical response of the network revealed that bundles were fully embedded along their entire length in a continuous and contractile network of cortical filaments. Moreover, the propagation of the contraction of these bundles throughout the entire cell was dependent on this embedding. In addition, these bundles appeared to originate from the alignment and coalescence of thin and unattached cortical actin filaments from the surrounding mesh."
225,Light-induced reversal of ion segregation in mixed-halide perovskites,2020-10-19,"Bandgap instability due to light-induced phase segregation in mixed-halide perovskites presents a major challenge for their future commercial use. Here we demonstrate that photoinduced halide-ion segregation can be completely reversed at sufficiently high illumination intensities, enabling control of the optical bandgap of a mixed-halide perovskite single crystal by optimizing the input photogenerated carrier density. We develop a polaron-based two-dimensional lattice model that rationalizes the experimentally observed phenomena by assuming that the driving force for photoinduced halide segregation is dependent on carrier-induced strain gradients that vanish at high carrier densities. Using illumination sources with different excitation intensities, we demonstrate write–read–erase experiments showing that it is possible to store information in the form of latent images over several minutes. The ability to control the local halide-ion composition with light intensity opens opportunities for the use of mixed-halide perovskites in concentrator and tandem solar cells, as well as in high-power light-emissive devices and optical memory applications."
226,Local negative permittivity and topological phase transition in polar skyrmions,2020-10-12,"Topological solitons such as magnetic skyrmions have drawn attention as stable quasi-particle-like objects. The recent discovery of polar vortices and skyrmions in ferroelectric oxide superlattices has opened up new vistas to explore topology, emergent phenomena and approaches for manipulating such features with electric fields. Using macroscopic dielectric measurements, coupled with direct scanning convergent beam electron diffraction imaging on the atomic scale, theoretical phase-field simulations and second-principles calculations, we demonstrate that polar skyrmions in (PbTiO3)n/(SrTiO3)n superlattices are distinguished by a sheath of negative permittivity at the periphery of each skyrmion. This enhances the effective dielectric permittivity compared with the individual SrTiO3 and PbTiO3 layers. Moreover, the response of these topologically protected structures to electric field and temperature shows a reversible phase transition from the skyrmion state to a trivial uniform ferroelectric state, accompanied by large tunability of the dielectric permittivity. Pulsed switching measurements show a time-dependent evolution and recovery of the skyrmion state (and macroscopic dielectric response). The interrelationship between topological and dielectric properties presents an opportunity to simultaneously manipulate both by a single, and easily controlled, stimulus, the applied electric field."
227,Cation-disordered rocksalt-type high-entropy cathodes for Li-ion batteries,2020-10-12,"High-entropy (HE) ceramics, by analogy with HE metallic alloys, are an emerging class of solid solutions composed of a large number of species. These materials offer the benefit of large compositional flexibility and can be used in a wide variety of applications, including thermoelectrics, catalysts, superionic conductors and battery electrodes. We show here that the HE concept can lead to very substantial improvements in performance in battery cathodes. Among lithium-ion cathodes, cation-disordered rocksalt (DRX)-type materials are an ideal platform within which to design HE materials because of their demonstrated chemical flexibility. By comparing a group of DRX cathodes containing two, four or six transition metal (TM) species, we show that short-range order systematically decreases, whereas energy density and rate capability systematically increase, as more TM cation species are mixed together, despite the total metal content remaining fixed. A DRX cathode with six TM species achieves 307 mAh g−1 (955 Wh kg−1) at a low rate (20 mA g−1), and retains more than 170 mAh g−1 when cycling at a high rate of 2,000 mA g−1. To facilitate further design in this HE DRX space, we also present a compatibility analysis of 23 different TM ions, and successfully synthesize a phase-pure HE DRX compound containing 12 TM species as a proof of concept."
228,Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya-like interaction in ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics,2020-10-12,"The Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI) between two magnetic moments mi and mj is of the form \({\rm{D}}_{ij} \cdot ({\rm{m}}_i \times {\rm{m}}_j)\). It originates from spin–orbit coupling, and is at the heart of fascinating phenomena involving non-collinear magnetism, such as magnetic topological defects (for example, skyrmions) as well as spin–orbit torques and magnetically driven ferroelectricity, that are of significant fundamental and technological interest. In sharp contrast, its electric counterpart, which is an electric DMI characterized by its \({{\bf{D}}}_{ij}^{\prime}\) strength and describing an interaction between two polar displacements ui and uj, has rarely been considered, despite the striking possibility that it could also generate new features associated with non-collinear patterns of electric dipoles. Here we report first-principles simulations combined with group theoretical symmetry analysis which not only demonstrate that electric DMI does exist and has a one-to-one correspondence with its magnetic analogue, but also reveals a physical source for it. These findings can be used to explain and/or design phenomena of possible technological importance in ferroelectrics and multiferroics."
229,Defect reconfiguration in a Ti–Al alloy via electroplasticity,2020-10-05,"It has been known for decades that the application of pulsed direct current can significantly enhance the formability of metals. However, the detailed mechanisms of this effect have been difficult to separate from simple Joule heating. Here, we study the electroplastic deformation of Ti–Al (7 at.% Al), an alloy that is uniquely suited for uncoupling this behaviour because, contrary to most metals, it has inherently lower ductility at higher temperature. We find that during mechanical deformation, electropulsing enhances cross-slip, producing a wavy dislocation morphology, and enhances twinning, which is similar to what occurs during cryogenic deformation. As a consequence, dislocations are prevented from localizing into planar slip bands that would lead to the early failure of the alloy under tension. Our results demonstrate that this macroscopic electroplastic behaviour originates from defect-level microstructural reconfiguration that cannot be rationalized by simple Joule heating."
230,Atomistic insights into metal hardening,2020-10-05,"For millennia, humans have exploited the natural property of metals to get stronger or harden when mechanically deformed. Ultimately rooted in the motion of dislocations, mechanisms of metal hardening have remained in the cross-hairs of physical metallurgists for over a century. Here, we performed atomistic simulations at the limits of supercomputing that are sufficiently large to be statistically representative of macroscopic crystal plasticity yet fully resolved to examine the origins of metal hardening at its most fundamental level of atomic motion. We demonstrate that the notorious staged (inflection) hardening of metals is a direct consequence of crystal rotation under uniaxial straining. At odds with widely divergent and contradictory views in the literature, we observe that basic mechanisms of dislocation behaviour are the same across all stages of metal hardening."
231,Gas-sieving zeolitic membranes fabricated by condensation of precursor nanosheets,2020-10-05,"The synthesis of molecular-sieving zeolitic membranes by the assembly of building blocks, avoiding the hydrothermal treatment, is highly desired to improve reproducibility and scalability. Here we report exfoliation of the sodalite precursor RUB-15 into crystalline 0.8-nm-thick nanosheets, that host hydrogen-sieving six-membered rings (6-MRs) of SiO4 tetrahedra. Thin films, fabricated by the filtration of a suspension of exfoliated nanosheets, possess two transport pathways: 6-MR apertures and intersheet gaps. The latter were found to dominate the gas transport and yielded a molecular cutoff of 3.6 Å with a H2/N2 selectivity above 20. The gaps were successfully removed by the condensation of the terminal silanol groups of RUB-15 to yield H2/CO2 selectivities up to 100. The high selectivity was exclusively from the transport across 6-MR, which was confirmed by a good agreement between the experimentally determined apparent activation energy of H2 and that computed by ab initio calculations. The scalable fabrication and the attractive sieving performance at 250–300 °C make these membranes promising for precombustion carbon capture."
232,Observation of fluctuation-mediated picosecond nucleation of a topological phase,2020-10-05,"Topological states of matter exhibit fascinating physics combined with an intrinsic stability. A key challenge is the fast creation of topological phases, which requires massive reorientation of charge or spin degrees of freedom. Here we report the picosecond emergence of an extended topological phase that comprises many magnetic skyrmions. The nucleation of this phase, followed in real time via single-shot soft X-ray scattering after infrared laser excitation, is mediated by a transient topological fluctuation state. This state is enabled by the presence of a time-reversal symmetry-breaking perpendicular magnetic field and exists for less than 300 ps. Atomistic simulations indicate that the fluctuation state largely reduces the topological energy barrier and thereby enables the observed rapid and homogeneous nucleation of the skyrmion phase. These observations provide fundamental insights into the nature of topological phase transitions, and suggest a path towards ultrafast topological switching in a wide variety of materials through intermediate fluctuating states."
233,Electrical bioadhesive interface for bioelectronics,2020-09-28,"Reliable functions of bioelectronic devices require conformal, stable and conductive interfaces with biological tissues. Integrating bioelectronic devices with tissues usually relies on physical attachment or surgical suturing; however, these methods face challenges such as non-conformal contact, unstable fixation, tissue damage, and/or scar formation. Here, we report an electrical bioadhesive (e-bioadhesive) interface, based on a thin layer of a graphene nanocomposite, that can provide rapid (adhesion formation within 5 s), robust (interfacial toughness >400 J m−2) and on-demand detachable integration of bioelectronic devices on diverse wet dynamic tissues. The electrical conductivity (>2.6 S m−1) of the e-bioadhesive interface further allows bidirectional bioelectronic communications. We demonstrate biocompatibility, applicability, mechanical and electrical stability, and recording and stimulation functionalities of the e-bioadhesive interface based on ex vivo porcine and in vivo rat models. These findings offer a promising strategy to improve tissue–device integration and enhance the performance of biointegrated electronic devices."
234,Mechanically robust lattices inspired by deep-sea glass sponges,2020-09-21,"The predominantly deep-sea hexactinellid sponges are known for their ability to construct remarkably complex skeletons from amorphous hydrated silica. The skeletal system of one such species of sponge, Euplectella aspergillum, consists of a square-grid-like architecture overlaid with a double set of diagonal bracings, creating a chequerboard-like pattern of open and closed cells. Here, using a combination of finite element simulations and mechanical tests on 3D-printed specimens of different lattice geometries, we show that the sponge’s diagonal reinforcement strategy achieves the highest buckling resistance for a given amount of material. Furthermore, using an evolutionary optimization algorithm, we show that our sponge-inspired lattice geometry approaches the optimum material distribution for the design space considered. Our results demonstrate that lessons learned from the study of sponge skeletal systems can be exploited for the realization of square lattice geometries that are geometrically optimized to avoid global structural buckling, with implications for improved material use in modern infrastructural applications."
235,Towards chirality control of graphene nanoribbons embedded in hexagonal boron nitride,2020-09-21,"The integrated in-plane growth of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) could provide a promising route to achieve integrated circuitry of atomic thickness. However, fabrication of edge-specific GNRs in the lattice of h-BN still remains a significant challenge. Here we developed a two-step growth method and successfully achieved sub-5-nm-wide zigzag and armchair GNRs embedded in h-BN. Further transport measurements reveal that the sub-7-nm-wide zigzag GNRs exhibit openings of the bandgap inversely proportional to their width, while narrow armchair GNRs exhibit some fluctuation in the bandgap-width relationship. An obvious conductance peak is observed in the transfer curves of 8- to 10-nm-wide zigzag GNRs, while it is absent in most armchair GNRs. Zigzag GNRs exhibit a small magnetic conductance, while armchair GNRs have much higher magnetic conductance values. This integrated lateral growth of edge-specific GNRs in h-BN provides a promising route to achieve intricate nanoscale circuits."
236,Wnt-modified materials mediate asymmetric stem cell division to direct human osteogenic tissue formation for bone repair,2020-09-21,"The maintenance of human skeletal stem cells (hSSCs) and their progeny in bone defects is a major challenge. Here, we report on a transplantable bandage containing a three-dimensional Wnt-induced osteogenic tissue model (WIOTM). This bandage facilitates the long-term viability of hSSCs (8 weeks) and their progeny, and enables bone repair in an in vivo mouse model of critical-sized calvarial defects. The newly forming bone is structurally comparable to mature cortical bone and consists of human and murine cells. Furthermore, we show that the mechanism of WIOTM formation is governed by Wnt-mediated asymmetric cell division of hSSCs. Covalently immobilizing Wnts onto synthetic materials can polarize single dividing hSSCs, orient the spindle and simultaneously generate a Wnt-proximal hSSC and a differentiation-prone Wnt-distal cell. Our results provide insight into the regulation of human osteogenesis and represent a promising approach to deliver human osteogenic constructs that can survive in vivo and contribute to bone repair."
237,Entanglement and control of single nuclear spins in isotopically engineered silicon carbide,2020-09-21,"Nuclear spins in the solid state are both a cause of decoherence and a valuable resource for spin qubits. In this work, we demonstrate control of isolated 29Si nuclear spins in silicon carbide (SiC) to create an entangled state between an optically active divacancy spin and a strongly coupled nuclear register. We then show how isotopic engineering of SiC unlocks control of single weakly coupled nuclear spins and present an ab initio method to predict the optimal isotopic fraction that maximizes the number of usable nuclear memories. We bolster these results by reporting high-fidelity electron spin control (F = 99.984(1)%), alongside extended coherence times (Hahn-echo T2 = 2.3 ms, dynamical decoupling T2DD > 14.5 ms), and a >40-fold increase in Ramsey spin dephasing time (T2*) from isotopic purification. Overall, this work underlines the importance of controlling the nuclear environment in solid-state systems and links single photon emitters with nuclear registers in an industrially scalable material."
238,Mechanistic insights of evaporation-induced actuation in supramolecular crystals,2020-09-14,"Water-responsive materials undergo reversible shape changes upon varying humidity levels. These mechanically robust yet flexible structures can exert substantial forces and hold promise as efficient actuators for energy harvesting, adaptive materials and soft robotics. Here we demonstrate that energy transfer during evaporation-induced actuation of nanoporous tripeptide crystals results from the strengthening of water hydrogen bonding that drives the contraction of the pores. The seamless integration of mobile and structurally bound water inside these pores with a supramolecular network that contains readily deformable aromatic domains translates dehydration-induced mechanical stresses through the crystal lattice, suggesting a general mechanism of efficient water-responsive actuation. The observed strengthening of water bonding complements the accepted understanding of capillary-force-induced reversible contraction for this class of materials. These minimalistic peptide crystals are much simpler in composition compared to natural water-responsive materials, and the insights provided here can be applied more generally for the design of high-energy molecular actuators."
239,Insight into the effects of confined hydrocarbon species on the lifetime of methanol conversion catalysts,2020-09-14,"The methanol-to-hydrocarbons reaction refers collectively to a series of important industrial catalytic processes to produce either olefins or gasoline. Mechanistically, methanol conversion proceeds through a ‘pool’ of hydrocarbon species. For the methanol-to-olefins process, these species can be delineated broadly into ‘desired’ lighter olefins and ‘undesired’ heavier fractions that cause deactivation in a matter of hours. The crux in further catalyst optimization is the ability to follow the formation of carbonaceous species during operation. Here, we report the combined results of an operando Kerr-gated Raman spectroscopic study with state-of-the-art operando molecular simulations, which allowed us to follow the formation of hydrocarbon species at various stages of methanol conversion. Polyenes are identified as crucial intermediates towards formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, with their fate determined largely by the zeolite topology. Notably, we provide the missing link between active and deactivating species, which allows us to propose potential design rules for future-generation catalysts."
240,Atomic-resolution electron microscopy of nanoscale local structure in lead-based relaxor ferroelectrics,2020-09-07,"Relaxor ferroelectrics, which can exhibit exceptional electromechanical coupling, are some of the most important functional materials, with applications ranging from ultrasound imaging to actuators. Since their discovery, their complex nanoscale chemical and structural heterogeneity has made the origins of their electromechanical properties extremely difficult to understand. Here, we employ aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy to quantify various types of nanoscale heterogeneities and their connection to local polarization in the prototypical relaxor ferroelectric system Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3–PbTiO3. We identify three main contributions that each depend on Ti content: chemical order, oxygen octahedral tilt and oxygen octahedral distortion. These heterogeneities are found to be spatially correlated with low-angle polar domain walls, indicating their role in disrupting long-range polarization and leading to nanoscale domain formation and the relaxor response. We further locate nanoscale regions of monoclinic-like distortion that correlate directly with Ti content and electromechanical performance. Through this approach, the connections between chemical heterogeneity, structural heterogeneity and local polarization are revealed, validating models that are needed to develop the next generation of relaxor ferroelectrics."
241,Ledge-directed epitaxy of continuously self-aligned single-crystalline nanoribbons of transition metal dichalcogenides,2020-09-07,"Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide nanoribbons are touted as the future extreme device downscaling for advanced logic and memory devices but remain a formidable synthetic challenge. Here, we demonstrate a ledge-directed epitaxy (LDE) of dense arrays of continuous, self-aligned, monolayer and single-crystalline MoS2 nanoribbons on β-gallium (iii) oxide (β-Ga2O3) (100) substrates. LDE MoS2 nanoribbons have spatial uniformity over a long range and transport characteristics on par with those seen in exfoliated benchmarks. Prototype MoS2-nanoribbon-based field-effect transistors exhibit high on/off ratios of 108 and an averaged room temperature electron mobility of 65 cm2 V−1 s−1. The MoS2 nanoribbons can be readily transferred to arbitrary substrates while the underlying β-Ga2O3 can be reused after mechanical exfoliation. We further demonstrate LDE as a versatile epitaxy platform for the growth of p-type WSe2 nanoribbons and lateral heterostructures made of p-WSe2 and n-MoS2 nanoribbons for futuristic electronics applications."
242,ILC1 drive intestinal epithelial and matrix remodelling,2020-09-07,"Organoids can shed light on the dynamic interplay between complex tissues and rare cell types within a controlled microenvironment. Here, we develop gut organoid cocultures with type-1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1) to dissect the impact of their accumulation in inflamed intestines. We demonstrate that murine and human ILC1 secrete transforming growth factor β1, driving expansion of CD44v6+ epithelial crypts. ILC1 additionally express MMP9 and drive gene signatures indicative of extracellular matrix remodelling. We therefore encapsulated human epithelial–mesenchymal intestinal organoids in MMP-sensitive, synthetic hydrogels designed to form efficient networks at low polymer concentrations. Harnessing this defined system, we demonstrate that ILC1 drive matrix softening and stiffening, which we suggest occurs through balanced matrix degradation and deposition. Our platform enabled us to elucidate previously undescribed interactions between ILC1 and their microenvironment, which suggest that they may exacerbate fibrosis and tumour growth when enriched in inflamed patient tissues."
243,A DNA nanodevice-based vaccine for cancer immunotherapy,2020-09-07,"A major challenge in cancer vaccine therapy is the efficient delivery of antigens and adjuvants to stimulate a controlled yet robust tumour-specific T-cell response. Here, we describe a structurally well defined DNA nanodevice vaccine generated by precisely assembling two types of molecular adjuvants and an antigen peptide within the inner cavity of a tubular DNA nanostructure that can be activated in the subcellular environment to trigger T-cell activation and cancer cytotoxicity. The integration of low pH-responsive DNA ‘locking strands’ outside the nanostructures enables the opening of the vaccine in lysosomes in antigen-presenting cells, exposing adjuvants and antigens to activate a strong immune response. The DNA nanodevice vaccine elicited a potent antigen-specific T-cell response, with subsequent tumour regression in mouse cancer models. Nanodevice vaccination generated long-term T-cell responses that potently protected the mice against tumour rechallenge."
244,A bioinspired and hierarchically structured shape-memory material,2020-08-31,"Shape-memory polymeric materials lack long-range molecular order that enables more controlled and efficient actuation mechanisms. Here, we develop a hierarchical structured keratin-based system that has long-range molecular order and shape-memory properties in response to hydration. We explore the metastable reconfiguration of the keratin secondary structure, the transition from α-helix to β-sheet, as an actuation mechanism to design a high-strength shape-memory material that is biocompatible and processable through fibre spinning and three-dimensional (3D) printing. We extract keratin protofibrils from animal hair and subject them to shear stress to induce their self-organization into a nematic phase, which recapitulates the native hierarchical organization of the protein. This self-assembly process can be tuned to create materials with desired anisotropic structuring and responsiveness. Our combination of bottom-up assembly and top-down manufacturing allows for the scalable fabrication of strong and hierarchically structured shape-memory fibres and 3D-printed scaffolds with potential applications in bioengineering and smart textiles."
245,Self-supported Pt–CoO networks combining high specific activity with high surface area for oxygen reduction,2020-08-24,"Several concepts for platinum-based catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are presented that exceed the US Department of Energy targets for Pt-related ORR mass activity. Most concepts achieve their high ORR activity by increasing the Pt specific activity at the expense of a lower electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). In the potential region controlled by kinetics, such a lower ECSA is counterbalanced by the high specific activity. At higher overpotentials, however, which are often applied in real systems, a low ECSA leads to limitations in the reaction rate not by kinetics, but by mass transport. Here we report on self-supported platinum–cobalt oxide networks that combine a high specific activity with a high ECSA. The high ECSA is achieved by a platinum–cobalt oxide bone nanostructure that exhibits unprecedentedly high mass activity for self-supported ORR catalysts. This concept promises a stable fuel-cell operation at high temperature, high current density and low humidification."
246,Bulk fatigue induced by surface reconstruction in layered Ni-rich cathodes for Li-ion batteries,2020-08-24,"Ni-rich layered cathode materials are among the most promising candidates for high-energy-density Li-ion batteries, yet their degradation mechanisms are still poorly understood. We report a structure-driven degradation mechanism for NMC811 (LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2), in which a proportion of the material exhibits a lowered accessible state of charge at the end of charging after repetitive cycling and becomes fatigued. Operando synchrotron long-duration X-ray diffraction enabled by a laser-thinned coin cell shows the emergence and growth in the concentration of this fatigued phase with cycle number. This degradation is structure driven and is not solely due to kinetic limitations or intergranular cracking: no bulk phase transformations, no increase in Li/Ni antisite mixing and no notable changes in the local structure or Li-ion mobility of the bulk are seen in aged NMCs. Instead, we propose that this degradation stems from the high interfacial lattice strain between the reconstructed surface and the bulk layered structure that develops when the latter is at states of charge above a distinct threshold of approximately 75%. This mechanism is expected to be universal in Ni-rich layered cathodes. Our findings provide fundamental insights into strategies to help mitigate this degradation process."
247,Intrinsic quantum confinement in formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite,2020-08-24,"Understanding the electronic energy landscape in metal halide perovskites is essential for further improvements in their promising performance in thin-film photovoltaics. Here, we uncover the presence of above-bandgap oscillatory features in the absorption spectra of formamidinium lead triiodide thin films. We attribute these discrete features to intrinsically occurring quantum confinement effects, for which the related energies change with temperature according to the inverse square of the intrinsic lattice parameter, and with peak index in a quadratic manner. By determining the threshold film thickness at which the amplitude of the peaks is appreciably decreased, and through ab initio simulations of the absorption features, we estimate the length scale of confinement to be 10–20 nm. Such absorption peaks present a new and intriguing quantum electronic phenomenon in a nominally bulk semiconductor, offering intrinsic nanoscale optoelectronic properties without necessitating cumbersome additional processing steps."
248,A natural impact-resistant bicontinuous composite nanoparticle coating,2020-08-17,"Nature utilizes the available resources to construct lightweight, strong and tough materials under constrained environmental conditions. The impact surface of the fast-striking dactyl club from the mantis shrimp is an example of one such composite material; the shrimp has evolved the capability to localize damage and avoid catastrophic failure from high-speed collisions during its feeding activities. Here we report that the dactyl club of mantis shrimps contains an impact-resistant coating composed of densely packed (about 88 per cent by volume) ~65-nm bicontinuous nanoparticles of hydroxyapatite integrated within an organic matrix. These mesocrystalline hydroxyapatite nanoparticles are assembled from small, highly aligned nanocrystals. Under impacts of high strain rates (around 104 s−1), particles rotate and translate, whereas the nanocrystalline networks fracture at low-angle grain boundaries, form dislocations and undergo amorphization. The interpenetrating organic network provides additional toughening, as well as substantial damping, with a loss coefficient of around 0.02. An unusual combination of stiffness and damping is therefore achieved, outperforming many engineered materials."
249,Conductivity control via minimally invasive anti-Frenkel defects in a functional oxide,2020-08-17,"Utilizing quantum effects in complex oxides, such as magnetism, multiferroicity and superconductivity, requires atomic-level control of the material’s structure and composition. In contrast, the continuous conductivity changes that enable artificial oxide-based synapses and multiconfigurational devices are driven by redox reactions and domain reconfigurations, which entail long-range ionic migration and changes in stoichiometry or structure. Although both concepts hold great technological potential, combined applications seem difficult due to the mutually exclusive requirements. Here we demonstrate a route to overcome this limitation by controlling the conductivity in the functional oxide hexagonal Er(Mn,Ti)O3 by using conductive atomic force microscopy to generate electric-field induced anti-Frenkel defects, that is, charge-neutral interstitial–vacancy pairs. These defects are generated with nanoscale spatial precision to locally enhance the electronic hopping conductivity by orders of magnitude without disturbing the ferroelectric order. We explain the non-volatile effects using density functional theory and discuss its universality, suggesting an alternative dimension to functional oxides and the development of multifunctional devices for next-generation nanotechnology."
250,Monolithic digital patterning of polydimethylsiloxane with successive laser pyrolysis,2020-08-17,"The patterning of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) into complex two-dimensional (2D) or 3D shapes is a crucial step for diverse applications based on soft lithography. Nevertheless, mould replication that incorporates time-consuming and costly photolithography processes still remains the dominant technology in the field. Here we developed monolithic quasi-3D digital patterning of PDMS using laser pyrolysis. In contrast with conventional burning or laser ablation of transparent PDMS, which yields poor surface properties, our successive laser pyrolysis technique converts PDMS into easily removable silicon carbide via consecutive photothermal pyrolysis guided by a continuous-wave laser. We obtained high-quality 2D or 3D PDMS structures with complex patterning starting from a PDMS monolith in a remarkably low prototyping time (less than one hour). Moreover, we developed distinct microfluidic devices with elaborated channel architectures and a customizable organ-on-a-chip device using this approach, which showcases the potential of the successive laser pyrolysis technique for the fabrication of devices for several technological applications."
251,Extra storage capacity in transition metal oxide lithium-ion batteries revealed by in situ magnetometry,2020-08-17,"In lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), many promising electrodes that are based on transition metal oxides exhibit anomalously high storage capacities beyond their theoretical values. Although this phenomenon has been widely reported, the underlying physicochemical mechanism in such materials remains elusive and is still a matter of debate. In this work, we use in situ magnetometry to demonstrate the existence of strong surface capacitance on metal nanoparticles, and to show that a large number of spin-polarized electrons can be stored in the already-reduced metallic nanoparticles (that are formed during discharge at low potentials in transition metal oxide LIBs), which is consistent with a space charge mechanism. Through quantification of the surface capacitance by the variation in magnetism, we further show that this charge capacity of the surface is the dominant source of the extra capacity in the Fe3O4/Li model system, and that it also exists in CoO, NiO, FeF2 and Fe2N systems. The space charge mechanism revealed by in situ magnetometry can therefore be generalized to a broad range of transition metal compounds for which a large electron density of states is accessible, and provides pivotal guidance for creating advanced energy storage systems."
252,Direct observation of highly confined phonon polaritons in suspended monolayer hexagonal boron nitride,2020-08-17,"Phonon polaritons enable light confinement at deep subwavelength scales, with potential technological applications, such as subdiffraction imaging, sensing and engineering of spontaneous emission. However, the trade-off between the degree of confinement and the excitation efficiency of phonon polaritons prevents direct observation of these modes in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), where they are expected to reach ultrahigh confinement. Here, we use monochromatic electron energy-loss spectroscopy (about 7.5 meV energy resolution) in a scanning transmission electron microscope to measure phonon polaritons in monolayer h-BN, directly demonstrating the existence of these modes as the phonon Reststrahlen band (RS) disappears. We find phonon polaritons in monolayer h-BN to exhibit high confinement (>487 times smaller wavelength than that of light in free space) and ultraslow group velocity down to about 10−5c. The large momentum compensation provided by electron beams additionally allows us to excite phonon polaritons over nearly the entire RS band of multilayer h-BN. These results open up a broad range of opportunities for the engineering of metasurfaces and strongly enhanced light–matter interactions."
253,Solution processable metal–organic frameworks for mixed matrix membranes using porous liquids,2020-08-10,"The combination of well-defined molecular cavities and chemical functionality makes crystalline porous solids attractive for a great number of technological applications, from catalysis to gas separation. However, in contrast to other widely applied synthetic solids such as polymers, the lack of processability of crystalline extended solids hampers their application. In this work, we demonstrate that metal–organic frameworks, a type of highly crystalline porous solid, can be made solution processable via outer surface functionalization using N-heterocyclic carbene ligands. Selective outer surface functionalization of relatively large nanoparticles (250 nm) of the well-known zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-67 allows for the stabilization of processable dispersions exhibiting permanent porosity. The resulting type III porous liquids can either be directly deployed as liquid adsorbents or be co-processed with state-of-the-art polymers to yield highly loaded mixed matrix membranes with excellent mechanical properties and an outstanding performance in the challenging separation of propylene from propane. We anticipate that this approach can be extended to other metal–organic frameworks and other applications."
254,The dose threshold for nanoparticle tumour delivery,2020-08-10,"Nanoparticle delivery to solid tumours over the past ten years has stagnated at a median of 0.7% of the injected dose. Varying nanoparticle designs and strategies have yielded only minor improvements. Here we discovered a dose threshold for improving nanoparticle tumour delivery: 1 trillion nanoparticles in mice. Doses above this threshold overwhelmed Kupffer cell uptake rates, nonlinearly decreased liver clearance, prolonged circulation and increased nanoparticle tumour delivery. This enabled up to 12% tumour delivery efficiency and delivery to 93% of cells in tumours, and also improved the therapeutic efficacy of Caelyx/Doxil. This threshold was robust across different nanoparticle types, tumour models and studies across ten years of the literature. Our results have implications for human translation and highlight a simple, but powerful, principle for designing nanoparticle cancer treatments."
255,Finned zeolite catalysts,2020-08-10,"There is growing evidence for the advantages of synthesizing nanosized zeolites with markedly reduced internal diffusion limitations for enhanced performances in catalysis and adsorption. Producing zeolite crystals with sizes less than 100 nm, however, is non-trivial, often requires the use of complex organics and typically results in a small product yield. Here we present an alternative, facile approach to enhance the mass-transport properties of zeolites by the epitaxial growth of fin-like protrusions on seed crystals. We validate this generalizable methodology on two common zeolites and confirm that fins are in crystallographic registry with the underlying seeds, and that secondary growth does not impede access to the micropores. Molecular modelling and time-resolved titration experiments of finned zeolites probe internal diffusion and reveal substantial improvements in mass transport, consistent with catalytic tests of a model reaction, which show that these structures behave as pseudo-nanocrystals with sizes commensurate to that of the fin. This approach could be extended to the rational synthesis of other zeolite and aluminosilicate materials."
256,Predictive modelling of structure formation in semiconductor films produced by meniscus-guided coating,2020-08-10,"Meniscus-guided coating methods, such as zone casting, dip coating and solution shearing, are scalable laboratory models for large-area solution coating of functional materials for thin-film electronics. Unfortunately, the general lack of understanding of how the coating parameters affect the dry-film morphology upholds trial-and-error experimentation and delays lab-to-fab translation. We present herein a model that predicts dry-film morphologies produced by meniscus-guided coating of a crystallizing solute. Our model reveals how the interplay between coating velocity and evaporation rate determines the crystalline domain size, shape anisotropy and regularity. If coating is fast, evaporation drives the system quickly past supersaturation, giving isotropic domain structures. If coating is slow, depletion due to crystallization stretches domains in the coating direction. The predicted morphologies have been experimentally confirmed by zone-casting experiments of the organic semiconductor 4-tolyl-bithiophenyl-diketopyrrolopyrrole. Although here we considered a small molecular solute, our model can be applied broadly to polymers and organic–inorganic hybrids such as perovskites."
257,Length scales of interfacial coupling between metal and insulator phases in oxides,2020-08-10,"Controlling phase transitions in transition metal oxides remains a central feature of both technological and fundamental scientific relevance. A well-known example is the metal–insulator transition, which has been shown to be highly controllable. However, the length scale over which these phases can be established is not yet well understood. To gain insight into this issue, we atomically engineered an artificially phase-separated system through fabricating epitaxial superlattices that consist of SmNiO3 and NdNiO3, two materials that undergo a metal-to-insulator transition at different temperatures. We demonstrate that the length scale of the interfacial coupling between metal and insulator phases is determined by balancing the energy cost of the boundary between a metal and an insulator and the bulk phase energies. Notably, we show that the length scale of this effect exceeds that of the physical coupling of structural motifs, which introduces a new framework for interface-engineering properties at temperatures against the bulk energetics."
258,Biosynthetic self-healing materials for soft machines,2020-07-27,"Self-healing materials are indispensable for soft actuators and robots that operate in dynamic and real-world environments, as these machines are vulnerable to mechanical damage. However, current self-healing materials have shortcomings that limit their practical application, such as low healing strength (below a megapascal) and long healing times (hours). Here, we introduce high-strength synthetic proteins that self-heal micro- and macro-scale mechanical damage within a second by local heating. These materials are optimized systematically to improve their hydrogen-bonded nanostructure and network morphology, with programmable healing properties (2–23 MPa strength after 1 s of healing) that surpass by several orders of magnitude those of other natural and synthetic soft materials. Such healing performance creates new opportunities for bioinspired materials design, and addresses current limitations in self-healing materials for soft robotics and personal protective equipment."
259,Ultrafast hot-hole injection modifies hot-electron dynamics in Au/p-GaN heterostructures,2020-07-27,"A fundamental understanding of hot-carrier dynamics in photo-excited metal nanostructures is needed to unlock their potential for photodetection and photocatalysis. Despite numerous studies on the ultrafast dynamics of hot electrons, so far, the temporal evolution of hot holes in metal–semiconductor heterostructures remains unknown. Here, we report ultrafast (t < 200 fs) hot-hole injection from Au nanoparticles into the valence band of p-type GaN. The removal of hot holes from below the Au Fermi level is observed to substantially alter the thermalization dynamics of hot electrons, reducing the peak electronic temperature and the electron–phonon coupling time of the Au nanoparticles. First-principles calculations reveal that hot-hole injection modifies the relaxation dynamics of hot electrons in Au nanoparticles by modulating the electronic structure of the metal on timescales commensurate with electron–electron scattering. These results advance our understanding of hot-hole dynamics in metal–semiconductor heterostructures and offer additional strategies for manipulating the dynamics of hot carriers on ultrafast timescales."
260,Tunable assembly of hybrid colloids induced by regioselective depletion,2020-07-27,"Assembling colloidal particles using site-selective directional interactions into predetermined colloidal superlattices with desired properties is broadly sought after, but challenging to achieve. Herein, we exploit regioselective depletion interactions to engineer the directional bonding and assembly of non-spherical colloidal hybrid microparticles. We report that the crystallization of a binary colloidal mixture can be regulated by tuning the depletion conditions. Subsequently, we fabricate triblock biphasic colloids with controlled aspect ratios to achieve regioselective bonding. Without any surface treatment, these biphasic colloids assemble into various colloidal superstructures and superlattices featuring optimized pole-to-pole or centre-to-centre interactions. Additionally, we observe polymorphic crystallization, quantify the abundancy of each form using algorithms we developed and investigate the crystallization process in real time. We demonstrate selective control of attractive interactions between specific regions on an anisotropic colloid with no need of site-specific surface functionalization, leading to a general method for achieving colloidal structures with yet unforeseen arrangements and properties."
261,Glassy Li metal anode for high-performance rechargeable Li batteries,2020-07-27,"Lithium metal has been considered an ideal anode for high-energy rechargeable Li batteries, although its nucleation and growth process remains mysterious, especially at the nanoscale. Here, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy was used to reveal the evolving nanostructure of Li metal deposits at various transient states in the nucleation and growth process, in which a disorder–order phase transition was observed as a function of current density and deposition time. The atomic interaction over wide spatial and temporal scales was depicted by reactive molecular dynamics simulations to assist in understanding the kinetics. Compared to crystalline Li, glassy Li outperforms in electrochemical reversibility, and it has a desired structure for high-energy rechargeable Li batteries. Our findings correlate the crystallinity of the nuclei with the subsequent growth of the nanostructure and morphology, and provide strategies to control and shape the mesostructure of Li metal to achieve high performance in rechargeable Li batteries."
262,Engineering long spin coherence times of spin–orbit qubits in silicon,2020-07-20,"Electron-spin qubits have long coherence times suitable for quantum technologies. Spin–orbit coupling promises to greatly improve spin qubit scalability and functionality, allowing qubit coupling via photons, phonons or mutual capacitances, and enabling the realization of engineered hybrid and topological quantum systems. However, despite much recent interest, results to date have yielded short coherence times (from 0.1 to 1 μs). Here we demonstrate ultra-long coherence times of 10 ms for holes where spin–orbit coupling yields quantized total angular momentum. We focus on holes bound to boron acceptors in bulk silicon 28, whose wavefunction symmetry can be controlled through crystal strain, allowing direct control over the longitudinal electric dipole that causes decoherence. The results rival the best electron-spin qubits and are 104 to 105 longer than previous spin–orbit qubits. These results open a pathway to develop new artificial quantum systems and to improve the functionality and scalability of spin-based quantum technologies."
263,Eliminating dissolution of platinum-based electrocatalysts at the atomic scale,2020-07-20,"A remaining challenge for the deployment of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells is the limited durability of platinum (Pt) nanoscale materials that operate at high voltages during the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction. In this work, atomic-scale insight into well-defined single-crystalline, thin-film and nanoscale surfaces exposed Pt dissolution trends that governed the design and synthesis of durable materials. A newly defined metric, intrinsic dissolution, is essential to understanding the correlation between the measured Pt loss, surface structure, size and ratio of Pt nanoparticles in a carbon (C) support. It was found that the utilization of a gold (Au) underlayer promotes ordering of Pt surface atoms towards a (111) structure, whereas Au on the surface selectively protects low-coordinated Pt sites. This mitigation strategy was applied towards 3 nm Pt3Au/C nanoparticles and resulted in the elimination of Pt dissolution in the liquid electrolyte, which included a 30-fold durability improvement versus 3 nm Pt/C over an extended potential range up to 1.2 V."
264,Preferential self-healing at grain boundaries in plasma-treated graphene,2020-07-20,"Engineering of defects located in grains or at grain boundaries is central to the development of functional materials. Although there is a surge of interest in the formation, migration and annihilation of defects during ion and plasma irradiation of bulk materials, these processes are rarely assessed in low-dimensional materials and remain mostly unexplored spectroscopically at the micrometre scale due to experimental limitations. Here, we use a hyperspectral Raman imaging scheme providing high selectivity and diffraction-limited spatial resolution to examine plasma-induced damage in a polycrystalline graphene film. Measurements conducted before and after very low-energy (11–13 eV) ion bombardment show defect generation in graphene grains following a zero-dimensional defect curve, whereas domain boundaries tend to develop as one-dimensional defects. Damage generation is slower at grain boundaries than within the grains, a behaviour ascribed to preferential self-healing. This evidence of local defect migration and structural recovery in graphene sheds light on the complexity of chemical and physical processes at the grain boundaries of two-dimensional materials."
265,Configurable phonon polaritons in twisted α-MoO,2020-07-13,"Moiré engineering is being intensively investigated as a method to tune the electronic, magnetic and optical properties of twisted van der Waals materials. Advances in moiré engineering stem from the formation of peculiar moiré superlattices at small, specific twist angles. Here we report configurable nanoscale light–matter waves—phonon polaritons—by twisting stacked α-phase molybdenum trioxide (α-MoO3) slabs over a broad range of twist angles from 0° to 90°. Our combined experimental and theoretical results reveal a variety of polariton wavefront geometries and topological transitions as a function of the twist angle. In contrast to the origin of the modified electronic band structure in moiré superlattices, the polariton twisting configuration is attributed to the electromagnetic interaction of highly anisotropic hyperbolic polaritons in stacked α-MoO3 slabs. These results indicate twisted α-MoO3 to be a promising platform for nanophotonic devices with tunable functionalities."
266,Excitons in strain-induced one-dimensional moiré potentials at transition metal dichalcogenide heterojunctions,2020-07-13,"The possibility of confining interlayer excitons in interfacial moiré patterns has recently gained attention as a strategy to form ordered arrays of zero-dimensional quantum emitters and topological superlattices in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures. Strain is expected to play an important role in the modulation of the moiré potential landscape, tuning the array of quantum dot-like zero-dimensional traps into parallel stripes of one-dimensional quantum wires. Here, we present real-space imaging of unstrained zero-dimensional and strain-induced one-dimensional moiré patterns along with photoluminescence measurements of the corresponding excitonic emission from WSe2/MoSe2 heterobilayers. Whereas excitons in zero-dimensional moiré traps display quantum emitter-like sharp photoluminescence peaks with circular polarization, the photoluminescence emission from excitons in one-dimensional moiré potentials shows linear polarization and two orders of magnitude higher intensity. These results establish strain engineering as an effective method to tailor moiré potentials and their optoelectronic response on demand."
267,High-performance solar flow battery powered by a perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell,2020-07-13,"The fast penetration of electrification in rural areas calls for the development of competitive decentralized approaches. A promising solution is represented by low-cost and compact integrated solar flow batteries; however, obtaining high energy conversion performance and long device lifetime simultaneously in these systems has been challenging. Here, we use high-efficiency perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells and redox flow batteries based on robust BTMAP-Vi/NMe-TEMPO redox couples to realize a high-performance and stable solar flow battery device. Numerical analysis methods enable the rational design of both components, achieving an optimal voltage match. These efforts led to a solar-to-output electricity efficiency of 20.1% for solar flow batteries, as well as improved device lifetime, solar power conversion utilization ratio and capacity utilization rate. The conceptual design strategy presented here also suggests general future optimization approaches for integrated solar energy conversion and storage systems."
268,-block single-metal-site tin/nitrogen-doped carbon fuel cell cathode catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction,2020-07-13,"This contribution reports the discovery and analysis of a p-block Sn-based catalyst for the electroreduction of molecular oxygen in acidic conditions at fuel cell cathodes; the catalyst is free of platinum-group metals and contains single-metal-atom actives sites coordinated by nitrogen. The prepared SnNC catalysts meet and exceed state-of-the-art FeNC catalysts in terms of intrinsic catalytic turn-over frequency and hydrogen–air fuel cell power density. The SnNC-NH3 catalysts displayed a 40–50% higher current density than FeNC-NH3 at cell voltages below 0.7 V. Additional benefits include a highly favourable selectivity for the four-electron reduction pathway and a Fenton-inactive character of Sn. A range of analytical techniques combined with density functional theory calculations indicate that stannic Sn(iv)Nx single-metal sites with moderate oxygen chemisorption properties and low pyridinic N coordination numbers act as catalytically active moieties. The superior proton-exchange membrane fuel cell performance of SnNC cathode catalysts under realistic, hydrogen–air fuel cell conditions, particularly after NH3 activation treatment, makes them a promising alternative to today’s state-of-the-art Fe-based catalysts."
269,A poly(thymine)–melamine duplex for the assembly of DNA nanomaterials,2020-07-13,"The diversity of DNA duplex structures is limited by a binary pair of hydrogen-bonded motifs. Here we show that poly(thymine) self-associates into antiparallel, right-handed duplexes in the presence of melamine, a small molecule that presents a triplicate set of the hydrogen-bonding face of adenine. X-ray crystallography shows that in the complex two poly(thymine) strands wrap around a helical column of melamine, which hydrogen bonds to thymine residues on two of its three faces. The mechanical strength of the thymine–melamine–thymine triplet surpasses that of adenine–thymine base pairs, which enables a sensitive detection of melamine at 3 pM. The poly(thymine)–melamine duplex is orthogonal to native DNA base pairing and can undergo strand displacement without the need for overhangs. Its incorporation into two-dimensional grids and hybrid DNA–small-molecule polymers highlights the poly(thymine)–melamine duplex as an additional tool for DNA nanotechnology."
270,Ultrastable monodisperse polymer glass formed by physical vapour deposition,2020-07-06,"Stable glasses prepared by vapour deposition are an analogue of glassy materials aged for geological timescales. The ability to prepare such materials allows the study of near-ideal glassy systems. We report the preparation and characterization of stable glasses of polymers prepared by physical vapour deposition. By controlling the substrate temperature, deposition rate and polydispersity, we prepared and characterized a variety of stable polymer glasses. These materials display the kinetic stability, low fictive temperatures and high-density characteristic of stable glasses. Extrapolation of the measured transformation times between the stable and normal glass provides estimates of the relaxation times of the equilibrium supercooled liquid at temperatures as much as 30 K below the glass transition temperature. These results demonstrate that polymer stable glasses are an exciting and powerful tool in the study of ultrastable glass and disordered materials in general."
271,Evidence of higher-order topology in multilayer WTe,2020-07-06,"Td-WTe2 (non-centrosymmetric and orthorhombic), a type-II Weyl semimetal, is expected to have higher-order topological phases with topologically protected, helical one-dimensional hinge states when its Weyl points are annihilated. However, the detection of these hinge states is difficult due to the semimetallic behaviour of the bulk. In this study, we have spatially resolved the hinge states by analysing the magnetic field interference of the supercurrent in Nb–WTe2–Nb proximity Josephson junctions. The Josephson current along the a axis of the WTe2 crystal, but not along the b axis, showed a sharp enhancement at the edges of the junction, and the amount of enhanced Josephson current was comparable to the upper limits of a single one-dimensional helical channel. Our experimental observations suggest a higher-order topological phase in WTe2 and its corresponding anisotropic topological hinge states, in agreement with theoretical calculations. Our work paves the way for the study of hinge states in topological transition-metal dichalcogenides and analogous phases."
272,Distinct handedness of spin wave across the compensation temperatures of ferrimagnets,2020-06-29,"Antiferromagnetic spin waves have been predicted to offer substantial functionalities for magnonic applications due to the existence of two distinct polarizations, the right-handed and left-handed modes, as well as their ultrafast dynamics. However, experimental investigations have been hampered by the field-immunity of antiferromagnets. Ferrimagnets have been shown to be an alternative platform to study antiferromagnetic spin dynamics. Here we investigate thermally excited spin waves in ferrimagnets across the magnetization compensation and angular momentum compensation temperatures using Brillouin light scattering. Our results show that right-handed and left-handed modes intersect at the angular momentum compensation temperature where pure antiferromagnetic spin waves are expected. A field-induced shift of the mode-crossing point from the angular momentum compensation temperature and the gyromagnetic reversal reveal hitherto unrecognized properties of ferrimagnetic dynamics. We also provide a theoretical understanding of our experimental results. Our work demonstrates important aspects of the physics of ferrimagnetic spin waves and opens up the attractive possibility of ferrimagnet-based magnonic devices."
273,Correlated electronic phases in twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides,2020-06-22,"In narrow electron bands in which the Coulomb interaction energy becomes comparable to the bandwidth, interactions can drive new quantum phases. Such flat bands in twisted graphene-based systems result in correlated insulator, superconducting and topological states. Here we report evidence of low-energy flat bands in twisted bilayer WSe2, with signatures of collective phases observed over twist angles that range from 4 to 5.1°. At half-band filling, a correlated insulator appeared that is tunable with both twist angle and displacement field. At a 5.1° twist, zero-resistance pockets were observed on doping away from half filling at temperatures below 3 K, which indicates a possible transition to a superconducting state. The observation of tunable collective phases in a simple band, which hosts only two holes per unit cell at full filling, establishes twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides as an ideal platform to study correlated physics in two dimensions on a triangular lattice."
274,Supramolecular–covalent hybrid polymers for light-activated mechanical actuation,2020-06-22,"The development of synthetic structures that mimic mechanical actuation in living matter such as autonomous translation and shape changes remains a grand challenge for materials science. In living systems the integration of supramolecular structures and covalent polymers contributes to the responsive behaviour of membranes, muscles and tendons, among others. Here we describe hybrid light-responsive soft materials composed of peptide amphiphile supramolecular polymers chemically bonded to spiropyran-based networks that expel water in response to visible light. The supramolecular polymers form a reversibly deformable and water-draining skeleton that mechanically reinforces the hybrid and can also be aligned by printing methods. The noncovalent skeleton embedded in the network thus enables faster bending and flattening actuation of objects, as well as longer steps during the light-driven crawling motion of macroscopic films. Our work suggests that hybrid bonding polymers, which integrate supramolecular assemblies and covalent networks, offer strategies for the bottom-up design of soft matter that mimics living organisms."
275,Understanding the luminescent nature of organic radicals for efficient doublet emitters and pure-red light-emitting diodes,2020-06-15,"The doublet-spin nature of radical emitters is advantageous for applications in organic light-emitting diodes, as it avoids the formation of triplet excitons that limit the electroluminescence efficiency of non-radical emitters. However, radicals generally show low optical absorption and photoluminescence yields. Here we explain the poor optical properties of radicals based on alternant hydrocarbons, and establish design rules to increase the absorption and luminescence yields for donor–acceptor-type radicals. We show that non-alternant systems are necessary to lift the degeneracy of the lowest energy orbital excitations; moreover, intensity borrowing from an intense high-lying transition by the low-energy charge-transfer excitation enhances the oscillator strength of the emitter. We apply these rules to design tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl–pyridoindolyl derivatives with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (>90%). Organic light-emitting diodes based on these molecules showed a pure-red emission with an over 12% external quantum efficiency. These insights may be beneficial for the rational design and discovery of highly luminescent doublet emitters."
276,Ferroelectric domain wall memory with embedded selector realized in LiNbO,2020-06-15,"Interfacial ‘dead’ layers between metals and ferroelectric thin films generally induce detrimental effects in nanocapacitors, yet their peculiar properties can prove advantageous in other electronic devices. Here, we show that dead layers with low Li concentration located at the surface of LiNbO3 ferroelectric materials can function as unipolar selectors. LiNbO3 mesa cells were etched from a single-crystal LiNbO3 substrate, and Pt metal contacts were deposited on their sides. Poling induced non-volatile switching of ferroelectric domains in the cell, and volatile switching in the domains in the interfacial (dead) layers, with the domain walls created within the substrate being electrically conductive. These features were also confirmed using single-crystal LiNbO3 thin films bonded to SiO2/Si wafers. The fabricated nanoscale mesa-structured memory cell with an embedded interfacial-layer selector shows a high on-to-off ratio (>106) and high switching endurance (~1010 cycles), showing potential for the fabrication of crossbar arrays of ferroelectric domain wall memories."
277,Resilient yet entirely degradable gelatin-based biogels for soft robots and electronics,2020-06-15,"Biodegradable and biocompatible elastic materials for soft robotics, tissue engineering or stretchable electronics with good mechanical properties, tunability, modifiability or healing properties drive technological advance, and yet they are not durable under ambient conditions and do not combine all the attributes in a single platform. We have developed a versatile gelatin-based biogel, which is highly resilient with outstanding elastic characteristics, yet degrades fully when disposed. It self-adheres, is rapidly healable and derived entirely from natural and food-safe constituents. We merge all the favourable attributes in one material that is easy to reproduce and scalable, and has a low-cost production under ambient conditions. This biogel is a step towards durable, life-like soft robotic and electronic systems that are sustainable and closely mimic their natural antetypes."
278,Highly efficient luminescence from space-confined charge-transfer emitters,2020-06-15,"Charge-transfer (CT) complexes, formed by electron transfer from a donor to an acceptor, play a crucial role in organic semiconductors. Excited-state CT complexes, termed exciplexes, harness both singlet and triplet excitons for light emission, and are thus useful for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, present exciplex emitters often suffer from low photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs), due to limited control over the relative orientation, electronic coupling and non-radiative recombination channels of the donor and acceptor subunits. Here, we use a rigid linker to control the spacing and relative orientation of the donor and acceptor subunits, as demonstrated with a series of intramolecular exciplex emitters based on 10-phenyl-9,10-dihydroacridine and 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine. Sky-blue OLEDs employing one of these emitters achieve an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 27.4% at 67 cd m−2 with only minor efficiency roll-off (EQE = 24.4%) at a higher luminous intensity of 1,000 cd m−2. As a control experiment, devices using chemically and structurally related but less rigid emitters reach substantially lower EQEs. These design rules are transferrable to other donor/acceptor combinations, which will allow further tuning of emission colour and other key optoelectronic properties."
279,Grain-orientation-engineered multilayer ceramic capacitors for energy storage applications,2020-06-15,"Dielectric ceramics are highly desired for electronic systems owing to their fast discharge speed and excellent fatigue resistance. However, the low energy density resulting from the low breakdown electric field leads to inferior volumetric efficiency, which is the main challenge for practical applications of dielectric ceramics. Here, we propose a strategy to increase the breakdown electric field and thus enhance the energy storage density of polycrystalline ceramics by controlling grain orientation. We fabricated high-quality <111>-textured Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3–Sr0.7Bi0.2TiO3 (NBT-SBT) ceramics, in which the strain induced by the electric field is substantially lowered, leading to a reduced failure probability and improved Weibull breakdown strength, on the order of 103 MV m−1, an ~65% enhancement compared to their randomly oriented counterparts. The recoverable energy density of <111>-textured NBT-SBT multilayer ceramics is up to 21.5 J cm−3, outperforming state-of-the-art dielectric ceramics. The present research offers a route for designing dielectric ceramics with enhanced breakdown strength, which is expected to benefit a wide range of applications of dielectric ceramics for which high breakdown strength is required, such as high-voltage capacitors and electrocaloric solid-state cooling devices."
280,Polar meron lattice in strained oxide ferroelectrics,2020-06-01,"A topological meron features a non-coplanar structure, whose order parameters in the core region are perpendicular to those near the perimeter. A meron is half of a skyrmion, and both have potential applications for information carrying and storage. Although merons and skyrmions in ferromagnetic materials can be readily obtained via inter-spin interactions, their behaviour and even existence in ferroelectric materials are still elusive. Here we observe using electron microscopy not only the atomic morphology of merons with a topological charge of 1/2, but also a periodic meron lattice in ultrathin PbTiO3 films under tensile epitaxial strain on a SmScO3 substrate. Phase-field simulations rationalize the formation of merons for which an epitaxial strain, as a single alterable parameter, plays a critical role in the coupling of lattice and charge. This study suggests that by engineering strain at the nanoscale it should be possible to fabricate topological polar textures, which in turn could facilitate the development of nanoscale ferroelectric devices."
281,Tracking intracellular forces and mechanical property changes in mouse one-cell embryo development,2020-05-25,"Cells comprise mechanically active matter that governs their functionality, but intracellular mechanics are difficult to study directly and are poorly understood. However, injected nanodevices open up opportunities to analyse intracellular mechanobiology. Here, we identify a programme of forces and changes to the cytoplasmic mechanical properties required for mouse embryo development from fertilization to the first cell division. Injected, fully internalized nanodevices responded to sperm decondensation and recondensation, and subsequent device behaviour suggested a model for pronuclear convergence based on a gradient of effective cytoplasmic stiffness. The nanodevices reported reduced cytoplasmic mechanical activity during chromosome alignment and indicated that cytoplasmic stiffening occurred during embryo elongation, followed by rapid cytoplasmic softening during cytokinesis (cell division). Forces greater than those inside muscle cells were detected within embryos. These results suggest that intracellular forces are part of a concerted programme that is necessary for development at the origin of a new embryonic life."
282,Cortical cell stiffness is independent of substrate mechanics,2020-05-25,"Cortical stiffness is an important cellular property that changes during migration, adhesion and growth. Previous atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation measurements of cells cultured on deformable substrates have suggested that cells adapt their stiffness to that of their surroundings. Here we show that the force applied by AFM to a cell results in a significant deformation of the underlying substrate if this substrate is softer than the cell. This ‘soft substrate effect’ leads to an underestimation of a cell’s elastic modulus when analysing data using a standard Hertz model, as confirmed by finite element modelling and AFM measurements of calibrated polyacrylamide beads, microglial cells and fibroblasts. To account for this substrate deformation, we developed a ‘composite cell–substrate model’. Correcting for the substrate indentation revealed that cortical cell stiffness is largely independent of substrate mechanics, which has major implications for our interpretation of many physiological and pathological processes."
283,Radiation-induced segregation in a ceramic,2020-05-25,"Radiation-induced segregation is well known in metals, but has been rarely studied in ceramics. We discover that radiation can induce notable segregation of one of the constituent elements to grain boundaries in a ceramic, despite the fact that the ceramic forms a line compound and therefore has a strong thermodynamic driving force to resist off-stoichiometry. Specifically, irradiation of silicon carbide at 300 °C leads to carbon enrichment near grain boundaries, whereas the enrichment diminishes for irradiation at 600 °C. The temperature dependence of this radiation-induced segregation is different from that shown in metallic systems. Using an ab initio informed rate theory model, we demonstrate that this difference is introduced by the unique defect energy landscapes present in the covalent system. Additionally, we discover that grain boundaries in unirradiated silicon carbide grown by chemical vapour deposition are intrinsically carbon-depleted. The inherent grain boundary chemistry and its evolution under radiation are both critical for understanding the many properties of ceramics associated with grain boundaries."
284,Spin–layer locking of interlayer excitons trapped in moiré potentials,2020-05-25,"Van der Waals heterostructures offer attractive opportunities to design quantum materials. For instance, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) possess three quantum degrees of freedom: spin, valley index and layer index. Furthermore, twisted TMD heterobilayers can form moiré patterns that modulate the electronic band structure according to the atomic registry, leading to spatial confinement of interlayer excitons (IXs). Here we report the observation of spin–layer locking of IXs trapped in moiré potentials formed in a heterostructure of bilayer 2H-MoSe2 and monolayer WSe2. The phenomenon of locked electron spin and layer index leads to two quantum-confined IX species with distinct spin–layer–valley configurations. Furthermore, we observe that the atomic registries of the moiré trapping sites in the three layers are intrinsically locked together due to the 2H-type stacking characteristic of bilayer TMDs. These results identify the layer index as a useful degree of freedom to engineer tunable few-level quantum systems in two-dimensional heterostructures."
285,Three-state nematicity in the triangular lattice antiferromagnet Fe,2020-05-18,"Nematic order is the breaking of rotational symmetry in the presence of translational invariance. While originally defined in the context of liquid crystals, the concept of nematic order has arisen in crystalline matter with discrete rotational symmetry, most prominently in the tetragonal Fe-based superconductors where the parent state is four-fold symmetric. In this case the nematic director takes on only two directions, and the order parameter in such ‘Ising-nematic’ systems is a simple scalar. Here, using a spatially resolved optical polarimetry technique, we show that a qualitatively distinct nematic state arises in the triangular lattice antiferromagnet Fe1/3NbS2. The crucial difference is that the nematic order on the triangular lattice is a \(Z_3\) or three-state Potts-nematic order parameter. As a consequence, the anisotropy axes of response functions such as the resistivity tensor can be continuously reoriented by external perturbations. This discovery lays the groundwork for devices that exploit analogies with nematic liquid crystals."
286,The interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics in the solid-state synthesis of layered oxides,2020-05-18,"In the synthesis of inorganic materials, reactions often yield non-equilibrium kinetic byproducts instead of the thermodynamic equilibrium phase. Understanding the competition between thermodynamics and kinetics is a fundamental step towards the rational synthesis of target materials. Here, we use in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction to investigate the multistage crystallization pathways of the important two-layer (P2) sodium oxides Na0.67MO2 (M = Co, Mn). We observe a series of fast non-equilibrium phase transformations through metastable three-layer O3, O3′ and P3 phases before formation of the equilibrium two-layer P2 polymorph. We present a theoretical framework to rationalize the observed phase progression, demonstrating that even though P2 is the equilibrium phase, compositionally unconstrained reactions between powder precursors favour the formation of non-equilibrium three-layered intermediates. These insights can guide the choice of precursors and parameters employed in the solid-state synthesis of ceramic materials, and constitutes a step forward in unravelling the complex interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics during materials synthesis."
287,Metabolic labeling and targeted modulation of dendritic cells,2020-05-18,"Targeted immunomodulation of dendritic cells (DCs) in vivo will enable manipulation of T-cell priming and amplification of anticancer immune responses, but a general strategy has been lacking. Here we show that DCs concentrated by a biomaterial can be metabolically labelled with azido groups in situ, which allows for their subsequent tracking and targeted modulation over time. Azido-labelled DCs were detected in lymph nodes for weeks, and could covalently capture dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)-bearing antigens and adjuvants via efficient Click chemistry for improved antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses and antitumour efficacy. We also show that azido labelling of DCs allowed for in vitro and in vivo conjugation of DBCO-modified cytokines, including DBCO–IL-15/IL-15Rα, to improve priming of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. This DC labelling and targeted modulation technology provides an unprecedented strategy for manipulating DCs and regulating DC–T-cell interactions in vivo."
288,Synthesis of mesoscale ordered two-dimensional π-conjugated polymers with semiconducting properties,2020-05-18,"Two-dimensional materials with high charge carrier mobility and tunable band gaps have attracted intense research effort for their potential use in nanoelectronics. Two-dimensional π-conjugated polymers constitute a promising subclass because the band structure can be manipulated by varying the molecular building blocks while preserving key features such as Dirac cones and high charge mobility. The major barriers to the application of two-dimensional π-conjugated polymers have been the small domain size and high defect density attained in the syntheses explored so far. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of mesoscale ordered two-dimensional π-conjugated polymer kagome lattices with semiconducting properties, Dirac cone structures and flat bands on Au(111). This material has been obtained by combining a rigid azatriangulene precursor and a hot dosing approach, which favours molecular diffusion and eliminates voids in the network. These results open opportunities for the synthesis of two-dimensional π-conjugated polymer Dirac cone materials and their integration into devices."
289,Twist-angle-dependent interlayer exciton diffusion in WS,2020-05-11,"The nanoscale periodic potentials introduced by moiré patterns in semiconducting van der Waals heterostructures have emerged as a platform for designing exciton superlattices. However, our understanding of the motion of excitons in moiré potentials is still limited. Here we investigated interlayer exciton dynamics and transport in WS2–WSe2 heterobilayers in time, space and momentum domains using transient absorption microscopy combined with first-principles calculations. We found that the exciton motion is modulated by twist-angle-dependent moiré potentials around 100 meV and deviates from normal diffusion due to the interplay between the moiré potentials and strong exciton–exciton interactions. Our experimental results verified the theoretical prediction of energetically favourable K–Q interlayer excitons and showed exciton-population dynamics that are controlled by the twist-angle-dependent energy difference between the K–Q and K–K excitons. These results form a basis to investigate exciton and spin transport in van der Waals heterostructures, with implications for the design of quantum communication devices."
290,Engineering high-energy-density sodium battery anodes for improved cycling with superconcentrated ionic-liquid electrolytes,2020-05-04,"Non-uniform metal deposition and dendrite formation in high-density energy storage devices reduces the efficiency, safety and life of batteries with metal anodes. Superconcentrated ionic-liquid electrolytes (for example 1:1 ionic liquid:alkali ion) coupled with anode preconditioning at more negative potentials can completely mitigate these issues, and therefore revolutionize high-density energy storage devices. However, the mechanisms by which very high salt concentration and preconditioning potential enable uniform metal deposition and prevent dendrite formation at the metal anode during cycling are poorly understood, and therefore not optimized. Here, we use atomic force microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to unravel the influence of these factors on the interface chemistry in a sodium electrolyte, demonstrating how a molten-salt-like structure at the electrode surface results in dendrite-free metal cycling at higher rates. Such a structure will support the formation of a more favourable solid electrolyte interphase, accepted as being a critical factor in stable battery cycling. This new understanding will enable engineering of efficient anode electrodes by tuning the interfacial nanostructure via salt concentration and high-voltage preconditioning."
291,Mechanism of collective interstitial ordering in Fe–C alloys,2020-05-04,"Collective interstitial ordering is at the core of martensite formation in Fe–C-based alloys, laying the foundation for high-strength steels. Even though this ordering has been studied extensively for more than a century, some fundamental mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show the unexpected effects of two correlated phenomena on the ordering mechanism: anharmonicity and segregation. The local anharmonicity in the strain fields induced by interstitials substantially reduces the critical concentration for interstitial ordering, up to a factor of three. Further, the competition between interstitial ordering and segregation results in an effective decrease of interstitial segregation into extended defects for high interstitial concentrations. The mechanism and corresponding impact on interstitial ordering identified here enrich the theory of phase transitions in materials and constitute a crucial step in the design of ultra-high-performance alloys."
292,Universal chemomechanical design rules for solid-ion conductors to prevent dendrite formation in lithium metal batteries,2020-04-27,"Dendrite formation during electrodeposition while charging lithium metal batteries compromises their safety. Although high-shear-modulus (Gs) solid-ion conductors (SICs) have been prioritized to resolve the pressure-driven instabilities that lead to dendrite propagation and cell shorting, it is unclear whether these or alternatives are needed to guide uniform lithium electrodeposition, which is intrinsically density-driven. Here, we show that SICs can be designed within a universal chemomechanical paradigm to access either pressure-driven dendrite-blocking or density-driven dendrite-suppressing properties, but not both. This dichotomy reflects the competing influence of the SIC’s mechanical properties and the partial molar volume of Li+ (\(V_{\mathrm{Li}^+}\)) relative to those of the lithium anode (GLi and VLi) on plating outcomes. Within this paradigm, we explore SICs in a previously unrecognized dendrite-suppressing regime that are concomitantly ‘soft’, as is typical of polymer electrolytes, but feature an atypically low \(V_{\mathrm{Li}^+}\) that is more reminiscent of ‘hard’ ceramics. Li plating (1 mA cm−2; T = 20 °C) mediated by these SICs is uniform, as revealed using synchrotron hard X-ray microtomography. As a result, cell cycle life is extended, even when assembled with thin Li anodes (~30 µm) and either high-voltage NMC-622 cathodes (1.44 mAh cm−2) or high-capacity sulfur cathodes (3.02 mAh cm−2)."
293,Biomimetic niches reveal the minimal cues to trigger apical lumen formation in single hepatocytes,2020-04-27,"The symmetry breaking of protein distribution and cytoskeleton organization is an essential aspect for the development of apicobasal polarity. In embryonic cells this process is largely cell autonomous, while differentiated epithelial cells collectively polarize during epithelium formation. Here, we demonstrate that the de novo polarization of mature hepatocytes does not require the synchronized development of apical poles on neighbouring cells. De novo polarization at the single-cell level by mere contact with the extracellular matrix and immobilized cadherin defining a polarizing axis. The creation of these single-cell liver hemi-canaliculi allows unprecedented imaging resolution and control and over the lumenogenesis process. We show that the density and localization of cadherins along the initial cell–cell contact act as key triggers of the reorganization from lateral to apical actin cortex. The minimal cues necessary to trigger the polarization of hepatocytes enable them to develop asymmetric lumens with ectopic epithelial cells originating from the kidney, breast or colon."
294,A year-long extended release nanoformulated cabotegravir prodrug,2020-04-27,"Long-acting cabotegravir (CAB) extends antiretroviral drug administration from daily to monthly. However, dosing volumes, injection site reactions and health-care oversight are obstacles towards a broad usage. The creation of poloxamer-coated hydrophobic and lipophilic CAB prodrugs with controlled hydrolysis and tissue penetrance can overcome these obstacles. To such ends, fatty acid ester CAB nanocrystal prodrugs with 14, 18 and 22 added carbon chains were encased in biocompatible surfactants named NMCAB, NM2CAB and NM3CAB and tested for drug release, activation, cytotoxicity, antiretroviral activities, pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Pharmacokinetics studies, performed in mice and rhesus macaques, with the lead 18-carbon ester chain NM2CAB, showed plasma CAB levels above the protein-adjusted 90% inhibitory concentration for up to a year. NM2CAB, compared with NMCAB and NM3CAB, demonstrated a prolonged drug release, plasma circulation time and tissue drug concentrations after a single 45 mg per kg body weight intramuscular injection. These prodrug modifications could substantially improve CAB’s effectiveness."
295,Modelling electrical conduction in nanostructure assemblies through complex networks,2020-04-20,"Carrier transport processes in assemblies of nanostructures rely on morphology-dependent and hierarchical conduction mechanisms, whose complexity cannot be captured by current modelling approaches. Here we apply the concept of complex networks to modelling carrier conduction in such systems. The approach permits assignment of arbitrary connectivity and connection strength between assembly constituents and is thus ideal for nanostructured films, composites and other geometries. Modelling of simplified rod-like nanostructures is consistent with analytical solutions, whereas results for more realistic nanostructure assemblies agree with experimental data and reveal conduction behaviour not captured by previous models. Fitting of ensemble measurements also allows the conduction properties of individual constituents to be extracted, which are subsequently used to guide the realization of transparent electrodes with improved performance. A global optimization process was employed to identify geometries and properties with high potential for transparent conductors. Our intuitive discretization approach, combined with a simple solver tool, allows researchers with little computational experience to carry out realistic simulations."
296,Molecular crowding electrolytes for high-voltage aqueous batteries,2020-04-20,"Developing low-cost and eco-friendly aqueous electrolytes with a wide voltage window is critical to achieve safe, high-energy and sustainable Li-ion batteries. Emerging approaches using highly concentrated salts (21–55 m (mol kg–1)) create artificial solid–electrode interfaces and improve water stability; however, these approaches raise concerns about cost and toxicity. Molecular crowding is a common phenomenon in living cells where water activity is substantially suppressed by molecular crowding agents through altering the hydrogen-bonding structure. Here we demonstrate a ‘molecular crowding’ electrolyte using the water-miscible polymer poly(ethylene glycol) as the crowding agent to decrease water activity, thereby achieving a wide electrolyte operation window (3.2 V) with low salt concentration (2 m). Aqueous Li4Ti5O12/LiMn2O4 full cells with stable specific energies between 75 and 110 W h kg−1 were demonstrated over 300 cycles. Online electrochemical mass spectroscopy revealed that common side reactions in aqueous Li-ion batteries (hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions) are virtually eliminated. This work provides a path for designing high-voltage aqueous electrolytes for low-cost and sustainable energy storage."
297,A general Lewis acidic etching route for preparing MXenes with enhanced electrochemical performance in non-aqueous electrolyte,2020-04-13,"Two-dimensional carbides and nitrides of transition metals, known as MXenes, are a fast-growing family of materials that have attracted attention as energy storage materials. MXenes are mainly prepared from Al-containing MAX phases (where A = Al) by Al dissolution in F-containing solution; most other MAX phases have not been explored. Here a redox-controlled A-site etching of MAX phases in Lewis acidic melts is proposed and validated by the synthesis of various MXenes from unconventional MAX-phase precursors with A elements Si, Zn and Ga. A negative electrode of Ti3C2 MXene material obtained through this molten salt synthesis method delivers a Li+ storage capacity of up to 738 C g−1 (205 mAh g−1) with high charge–discharge rate and a pseudocapacitive-like electrochemical signature in 1 M LiPF6 carbonate-based electrolyte. MXenes prepared via this molten salt synthesis route may prove suitable for use as high-rate negative-electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage applications."
298,Variability and origins of grain boundary electric potential detected by electron holography and atom-probe tomography,2020-04-13,"A number of grain boundary phenomena in ionic materials, in particular, anomalous (either depressed or enhanced) charge transport, have been attributed to space charge effects. Developing effective strategies to manipulate transport behaviour requires deep knowledge of the origins of the interfacial charge, as well as its variability within a polycrystalline sample with millions of unique grain boundaries. Electron holography is a powerful technique uniquely suited for studying the electric potential profile at individual grain boundaries, whereas atom-probe tomography provides access to the chemical identify of essentially every atom at individual grain boundaries. Using these two techniques, we show here that the space charge potential at grain boundaries in lightly doped, high-purity ceria can vary by almost an order of magnitude. We further find that trace impurities (<25 ppm), rather than inherent thermodynamic factors, may be the ultimate source of grain boundary charge. These insights suggest chemical tunability of grain boundary transport properties."
299,Dipolar interactions between localized interlayer excitons in van der Waals heterostructures,2020-04-13,"Although photons in free space barely interact, matter can mediate interactions between them resulting in optical nonlinearities. Such interactions at the single-quantum level result in an on-site photon repulsion, crucial for photon-based quantum information processing and for realizing strongly interacting many-body states of light. Here, we report repulsive dipole–dipole interactions between electric field-tuneable, localized interlayer excitons in the MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayer. The presence of a single, localized exciton with an out-of-plane, non-oscillating dipole moment increases the energy of the second excitation by ~2 meV—an order of magnitude larger than the emission linewidth and corresponding to an inter-dipole distance of ~7 nm. At higher excitation power, multi-exciton complexes appear at systematically higher energies. The magnetic field dependence of the emission polarization is consistent with the spin-valley singlet nature of the dipolar molecular state. Our finding represents a step towards the creation of excitonic few- and many-body states such as dipolar crystals with spin-valley spinor in van der Waals heterostructures."
300,Nonlinear Luttinger liquid plasmons in semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes,2020-03-30,"Interacting electrons confined in one dimension are generally described by the Luttinger liquid formalism, where the low-energy electronic dispersion is assumed to be linear and the resulting plasmonic excitations are non-interacting. Instead, a Luttinger liquid in one-dimensional materials with nonlinear electronic bands is expected to show strong plasmon–plasmon interactions, but an experimental demonstration of this behaviour has been lacking. Here, we combine infrared nano-imaging and electronic transport to investigate the behaviour of plasmonic excitations in semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes with carrier density controlled by electrostatic gating. We show that both the propagation velocity and the dynamic damping of plasmons can be tuned continuously, which is well captured by the nonlinear Luttinger liquid theory. These results contrast with the gate-independent plasmons observed in metallic nanotubes, as expected for a linear Luttinger liquid. Our findings provide an experimental demonstration of one-dimensional electron dynamics beyond the conventional linear Luttinger liquid paradigm and are important for understanding excited-state properties in one dimension."
301,Visualizing coexisting surface states in the weak and crystalline topological insulator Bi,2020-03-23,"Dual topological materials are unique topological phases that host coexisting surface states of different topological nature on the same or on different material facets. Here, we show that Bi2TeI is a dual topological insulator. It exhibits band inversions at two time reversal symmetry points of the bulk band, which classify it as a weak topological insulator with metallic states on its ‘side’ surfaces. The mirror symmetry of the crystal structure concurrently classifies it as a topological crystalline insulator. We investigated Bi2TeI spectroscopically to show the existence of both two-dimensional Dirac surface states, which are susceptible to mirror symmetry breaking, and one-dimensional channels that reside along the step edges. Their mutual coexistence on the step edge, where both facets join, is facilitated by momentum and energy segregation. Our observation of a dual topological insulator should stimulate investigations of other dual topology classes with distinct surface manifestations coexisting at their boundaries."
302,Fermionic time-reversal symmetry in a photonic topological insulator,2020-03-23,"Much of the recent attention directed towards topological insulators is motivated by their hallmark feature of protected chiral edge states. In electronic (or fermionic) topological insulators, these states originate from time-reversal symmetry and allow carriers with opposite spin-polarization to propagate in opposite directions at the edge of an insulating bulk. By contrast, photonic (or bosonic) systems are generally assumed to be precluded from supporting edge states that are intrinsically protected by time-reversal symmetry. Here, we experimentally demonstrate counter-propagating chiral states at the edge of a time-reversal-symmetric photonic waveguide structure. The pivotal step in our approach is the design of a Floquet driving protocol that incorporates effective fermionic time-reversal symmetry, enabling the realization of the photonic version of an electronic topological insulator. Our findings allow for fermionic properties to be harnessed in bosonic systems, thereby offering alternative opportunities for photonics as well as acoustics, mechanical waves and cold atoms."
303,Realizing spin Hamiltonians in nanoscale active photonic lattices,2020-03-16,"Spin models arise in the microscopic description of magnetic materials and have been recently used to map certain classes of optimization problems involving large degrees of freedom. In this regard, various optical implementations of such Hamiltonians have been demonstrated to quickly converge to the global minimum in the energy landscape. Yet, so far, an integrated nanophotonic platform capable of emulating complex magnetic materials is still missing. Here, we show that the cooperative interplay among vectorial electromagnetic modes in coupled metallic nanolasers can be utilized to implement certain types of spin Hamiltonians. Depending on the topology/geometry of the arrays, these structures can be governed by a classical XY Hamiltonian that exhibits ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings, as well as geometrical frustration. Our results pave the way towards a scalable nanophotonic platform to study spin exchange interactions and could address a variety of optimization problems."
304,Enhancement-mode ion-based transistor as a comprehensive interface and real-time processing unit for in vivo electrophysiology,2020-03-16,"Bioelectronic devices must be fast and sensitive to interact with the rapid, low-amplitude signals generated by neural tissue. They should also be biocompatible and soft, and should exhibit long-term stability in physiologic environments. Here, we develop an enhancement-mode, internal ion-gated organic electrochemical transistor (e-IGT) based on a reversible redox reaction and hydrated ion reservoirs within the conducting polymer channel, which enable long-term stable operation and shortened ion transit time. E-IGT transient responses depend on hole rather than ion mobility, and combine with high transconductance to result in a gain–bandwidth product that is several orders of magnitude above that of other ion-based transistors. We used these transistors to acquire a wide range of electrophysiological signals, including in vivo recording of neural action potentials, and to create soft, biocompatible, long-term implantable neural processing units for the real-time detection of epileptic discharges. E-IGTs offer a safe, reliable and high-performance building block for chronically implanted bioelectronics, with a spatiotemporal resolution at the scale of individual neurons."
305,Atomically thin half-van der Waals metals enabled by confinement heteroepitaxy,2020-03-10,"Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) metals may be key ingredients in next-generation quantum and optoelectronic devices. However, 2D metals must be stabilized against environmental degradation and integrated into heterostructure devices at the wafer scale. The high-energy interface between silicon carbide and epitaxial graphene provides an intriguing framework for stabilizing a diverse range of 2D metals. Here we demonstrate large-area, environmentally stable, single-crystal 2D gallium, indium and tin that are stabilized at the interface of epitaxial graphene and silicon carbide. The 2D metals are covalently bonded to SiC below but present a non-bonded interface to the graphene overlayer; that is, they are ‘half van der Waals’ metals with strong internal gradients in bonding character. These non-centrosymmetric 2D metals offer compelling opportunities for superconducting devices, topological phenomena and advanced optoelectronic properties. For example, the reported 2D Ga is a superconductor that combines six strongly coupled Ga-derived electron pockets with a large nearly free-electron Fermi surface that closely approaches the Dirac points of the graphene overlayer."
306,Correlating the three-dimensional atomic defects and electronic properties of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides,2020-03-09,"The electronic, optical and chemical properties of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides strongly depend on their three-dimensional atomic structure and crystal defects. Using Re-doped MoS2 as a model system, here we present scanning atomic electron tomography as a method to determine three-dimensional atomic positions as well as positions of crystal defects such as dopants, vacancies and ripples with a precision down to 4 pm. We measure the three-dimensional bond distortion and local strain tensor induced by single dopants. By directly providing these experimental three-dimensional atomic coordinates to density functional theory, we obtain more accurate electronic band structures than derived from conventional density functional theory calculations that relies on relaxed three-dimensional atomic coordinates. We anticipate that scanning atomic electron tomography not only will be generally applicable to determine the three-dimensional atomic coordinates of two-dimensional materials, but also will enable ab initio calculations to better predict the physical, chemical and electronic properties of these materials."
307,Efficient metal ion sieving in rectifying subnanochannels enabled by metal–organic frameworks,2020-03-09,"Biological ion channels have remarkable ion selectivity, permeability and rectification properties, but it is challenging to develop artificial analogues. Here, we report a metal–organic framework-based subnanochannel (MOFSNC) with heterogeneous structure and surface chemistry to achieve these properties. The asymmetrically structured MOFSNC can rapidly conduct K+, Na+ and Li+ in the subnanometre-to-nanometre channel direction, with conductivities up to three orders of magnitude higher than those of Ca2+ and Mg2+, equivalent to a mono/divalent ion selectivity of 103. Moreover, by varying the pH from 3 to 8 the ion selectivity can be tuned further by a factor of 102 to 104. Theoretical simulations indicate that ion–carboxyl interactions substantially reduce the energy barrier for monovalent cations to pass through the MOFSNC, and thus lead to ultrahigh ion selectivity. These findings suggest ways to develop ion selective devices for efficient ion separation, energy reservation and power generation."
308,Ground-state electron transfer in all-polymer donor–acceptor heterojunctions,2020-03-09,"Doping of organic semiconductors is crucial for the operation of organic (opto)electronic and electrochemical devices. Typically, this is achieved by adding heterogeneous dopant molecules to the polymer bulk, often resulting in poor stability and performance due to dopant sublimation or aggregation. In small-molecule donor–acceptor systems, charge transfer can yield high and stable electrical conductivities, an approach not yet explored in all-conjugated polymer systems. Here, we report ground-state electron transfer in all-polymer donor–acceptor heterojunctions. Combining low-ionization-energy polymers with high-electron-affinity counterparts yields conducting interfaces with resistivity values five to six orders of magnitude lower than the separate single-layer polymers. The large decrease in resistivity originates from two parallel quasi-two-dimensional electron and hole distributions reaching a concentration of ∼1013 cm–2. Furthermore, we transfer the concept to three-dimensional bulk heterojunctions, displaying exceptional thermal stability due to the absence of molecular dopants. Our findings hold promise for electro-active composites of potential use in, for example, thermoelectrics and wearable electronics."
309,High oxide ion and proton conductivity in a disordered hexagonal perovskite,2020-03-02,"Oxide ion and proton conductors, which exhibit high conductivity at intermediate temperature, are necessary to improve the performance of ceramic fuel cells. The crystal structure plays a pivotal role in defining the ionic conduction properties, and the discovery of new materials is a challenging research focus. Here, we show that the undoped hexagonal perovskite Ba7Nb4MoO20 supports pure ionic conduction with high proton and oxide ion conductivity at 510 °C (the bulk conductivity is 4.0 mS cm−1), and hence is an exceptional candidate for application as a dual-ion solid electrolyte in a ceramic fuel cell that will combine the advantages of both oxide ion and proton-conducting electrolytes. Ba7Nb4MoO20 also showcases excellent chemical and electrical stability. Hexagonal perovskites form an important new family of materials for obtaining novel ionic conductors with potential applications in a range of energy-related technologies."
310,Contact and macroscopic ageing in colloidal suspensions,2020-03-02,"The ageing behaviour of dense suspensions or pastes at rest is almost exclusively attributed to structural dynamics. Here, we identify another ageing process, contact-controlled ageing, consisting of the progressive stiffening of solid–solid contacts of an arrested colloidal suspension. By combining rheometry, confocal microscopy and particle-scale mechanical tests using laser tweezers, we demonstrate that this process governs the shear-modulus ageing of dense aqueous silica and polymer latex suspensions at moderate ionic strengths. We further show that contact-controlled ageing becomes relevant as soon as Coulombic interactions are sufficiently screened out that the formation of solid–solid contacts is not limited by activation barriers. Given that this condition only requires moderate ion concentrations, contact-controlled ageing should be generic in a wide class of materials, such as cements, soils or three-dimensional inks, thus questioning our understanding of ageing dynamics in these systems."
311,Revealing multiple classes of stable quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride with correlated optical and electron microscopy,2020-02-24,"Defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) exhibit high-brightness, room-temperature quantum emission, but their large spectral variability and unknown local structure challenge their technological utility. Here, we directly correlate hBN quantum emission with local strain using a combination of photoluminescence (PL), cathodoluminescence (CL) and nanobeam electron diffraction. Across 40 emitters, we observe zero phonon lines (ZPLs) in PL and CL ranging from 540 to 720 nm. CL mapping reveals that multiple defects and distinct defect species located within an optically diffraction-limited region can each contribute to the observed PL spectra. Local strain maps indicate that strain is not required to activate the emitters and is not solely responsible for the observed ZPL spectral range. Instead, at least four distinct defect classes are responsible for the observed emission range, and all four classes are stable upon both optical and electron illumination. Our results provide a foundation for future atomic-scale optical characterization of colour centres."
312,Bandgap tuning of two-dimensional materials by sphere diameter engineering,2020-02-24,"Developing a precise and reproducible bandgap tuning method that enables tailored design of materials is of crucial importance for optoelectronic devices. Towards this end, we report a sphere diameter engineering (SDE) technique to manipulate the bandgap of two-dimensional (2D) materials. A one-to-one correspondence with an ideal linear working curve is established between the bandgap of MoS2 and the sphere diameter in a continuous range as large as 360 meV. Fully uniform bandgap tuning of all the as-grown MoS2 crystals is realized due to the isotropic characteristic of the sphere. More intriguingly, both a decrease and an increase of the bandgap can be achieved by constructing a positive or negative curvature. By fusing individual spheres in the melted state, post-synthesis bandgap adjustment of the supported 2D materials can be realized. This SDE technique, showing good precision, uniformity and reproducibility with high efficiency, may further accelerate the potential applications of 2D materials."
313,Initialization and read-out of intrinsic spin defects in a van der Waals crystal at room temperature,2020-02-24,"Optically addressable spins in wide-bandgap semiconductors are a promising platform for exploring quantum phenomena. While colour centres in three-dimensional crystals such as diamond and silicon carbide were studied in detail, they were not observed experimentally in two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here, we report spin-dependent processes in the 2D material hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We identify fluorescence lines associated with a particular defect, the negatively charged boron vacancy (\({\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{B}}^ -\)), showing a triplet (S = 1) ground state and zero-field splitting of ~3.5 GHz. We establish that this centre exhibits optically detected magnetic resonance at room temperature and demonstrate its spin polarization under optical pumping, which leads to optically induced population inversion of the spin ground state—a prerequisite for coherent spin-manipulation schemes. Our results constitute a step forward in establishing 2D hBN as a prime platform for scalable quantum technologies, with potential for spin-based quantum information and sensing applications."
314,One-dimensional intergrowths in two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets and their effect on ultra-selective transport,2020-02-24,"Zeolite MFI is a widely used catalyst and adsorbent that also holds promise as a thin-film membrane. The discovery of nanometre-thick two-dimensional (2D) MFI nanosheets has facilitated methods for thin-film zeolite fabrication that open new horizons for membrane science and engineering. However, the crystal structure of 2D-MFI nanosheets and their relationship to separation performance remain elusive. Using transmission electron microscopy, we find that one- to few-unit-cell-wide intergrowths of zeolite MEL exist within 2D-MFI. We identify the planar distribution of these 1D or near-1D-MEL domains, and show that a fraction of nanosheets have high (~25% by volume) MEL content while the majority of nanosheets are MEL-free. Atomistic simulations show that commensurate knitting of 1D-MEL within 2D-MFI creates more rigid and highly selective pores compared to pristine MFI nanosheets, and permeation experiments show a separation factor of 60 using an industrially relevant (undiluted 1 bar xylene mixture) feed. Confined growth in graphite is shown to increase the MEL content in MFI nanosheets. Our observation of these intergrowths suggests strategies for the development of ultra-selective zeolite membranes."
315,Understanding the conversion mechanism and performance of monodisperse FeF,2020-02-24,"The application of transition metal fluorides as energy-dense cathode materials for lithium ion batteries has been hindered by inadequate understanding of their electrochemical capabilities and limitations. Here, we present an ideal system for mechanistic study through the colloidal synthesis of single-crystalline, monodisperse iron(ii) fluoride nanorods. Near theoretical capacity (570 mA h g−1) and extraordinary cycling stability (>90% capacity retention after 50 cycles at C/20) is achieved solely through the use of an ionic liquid electrolyte (1 m LiFSI/Pyr1,3FSI), which forms a stable solid electrolyte interphase and prevents the fusing of particles. This stability extends over 200 cycles at much higher rates (C/2) and temperatures (50 °C). High-resolution analytical transmission electron microscopy reveals intricate morphological features, lattice orientation relationships and oxidation state changes that comprehensively describe the conversion mechanism. Phase evolution, diffusion kinetics and cell failure are critically influenced by surface-specific reactions. The reversibility of the conversion reaction is governed by topotactic cation diffusion through an invariant lattice of fluoride anions and the nucleation of metallic particles on semicoherent interfaces. This new understanding is used to showcase the inherently high discharge rate capability of FeF2."
316,Bi-directional tuning of thermal transport in SrCoO,2020-02-24,"Unlike the wide-ranging dynamic control of electrical conductivity, there does not exist an analogous ability to tune thermal conductivity by means of electric potential. The traditional picture assumes that atoms inserted into a material’s lattice act purely as a source of scattering for thermal carriers, which can only reduce thermal conductivity. In contrast, here we show that the electrochemical control of oxygen and proton concentration in an oxide provides a new ability to bi-directionally control thermal conductivity. On electrochemically oxygenating the brownmillerite SrCoO2.5 to the perovskite SrCoO3–δ, the thermal conductivity increases by a factor of 2.5, whereas protonating it to form hydrogenated SrCoO2.5 effectively reduces the thermal conductivity by a factor of four. This bi-directional tuning of thermal conductivity across a nearly 10 ± 4-fold range at room temperature is achieved by using ionic liquid gating to trigger the ‘tri-state’ phase transitions in a single device. We elucidated the effects of these anionic and cationic species, and the resultant changes in lattice constants and lattice symmetry on thermal conductivity by combining chemical and structural information from X-ray absorption spectroscopy with thermoreflectance thermal conductivity measurements and ab initio calculations. This ability to control multiple ion types, multiple phase transitions and electronic conductivity that spans metallic through to insulating behaviour in oxides by electrical means provides a new framework for tuning thermal transport over a wide range."
317,Reprogramming normal cells into tumour precursors requires ECM stiffness and oncogene-mediated changes of cell mechanical properties,2020-02-17,"Defining the interplay between the genetic events and microenvironmental contexts necessary to initiate tumorigenesis in normal cells is a central endeavour in cancer biology. We found that receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)–Ras oncogenes reprogram normal, freshly explanted primary mouse and human cells into tumour precursors, in a process requiring increased force transmission between oncogene-expressing cells and their surrounding extracellular matrix. Microenvironments approximating the normal softness of healthy tissues, or blunting cellular mechanotransduction, prevent oncogene-mediated cell reprogramming and tumour emergence. However, RTK–Ras oncogenes empower a disproportional cellular response to the mechanical properties of the cell’s environment, such that when cells experience even subtle supra-physiological extracellular-matrix rigidity they are converted into tumour-initiating cells. These regulations rely on YAP/TAZ mechanotransduction, and YAP/TAZ target genes account for a large fraction of the transcriptional responses downstream of oncogenic signalling. This work lays the groundwork for exploiting oncogenic mechanosignalling as a vulnerability at the onset of tumorigenesis, including tumour prevention strategies."
318,Quantum dynamics of a single molecule magnet on superconducting Pb(111),2020-02-17,"Magnetic materials interfaced with superconductors may reveal new physical phenomena with potential for quantum technologies. The use of molecules as magnetic components has already shown great promise, but the diversity of properties offered by the molecular realm remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate a submonolayer of tetrairon(iii) propeller-shaped single molecule magnets deposited on a superconducting lead surface. This material combination reveals a strong influence of the superconductor on the spin dynamics of the single molecule magnet. It is shown that the superconducting transition to the condensate state switches the single molecule magnet from a blocked magnetization state to a resonant quantum tunnelling regime. Our results open perspectives to control single molecule magnetism via superconductors and to use single molecule magnets as local probes of the superconducting state."
319,Multi-cation perovskites prevent carrier reflection from grain surfaces,2020-02-10,"The composition of perovskite has been optimized combinatorially such that it often contains six components (AxByC1−x−yPbXzY3−z) in state-of-art perovskite solar cells. Questions remain regarding the precise role of each component, and the lack of a mechanistic explanation limits the practical exploration of the large and growing chemical space. Here, aided by transient photoluminescence microscopy, we find that, in perovskite single crystals, carrier diffusivity is in fact independent of composition. In polycrystalline thin films, the different compositions play a crucial role in carrier diffusion. We report that methylammonium (MA)-based films show a high carrier diffusivity of 0.047 cm2 s−1, while MA-free mixed caesium-formamidinium (CsFA) films exhibit an order of magnitude lower diffusivity. Elemental composition studies show that CsFA grains display a graded composition. This curtails electron diffusion in these films, as seen in both vertical carrier transport and surface potential studies. Incorporation of MA leads to a uniform grain core-to-edge composition, giving rise to a diffusivity of 0.034 cm2 s−1 in CsMAFA films. A model that invokes competing crystallization processes allows us to account for this finding, and suggests further strategies to achieve homogeneous crystallization for the benefit of perovskite optoelectronics."
320,Molecular understanding of charge storage and charging dynamics in supercapacitors with MOF electrodes and ionic liquid electrolytes,2020-02-03,"We performed constant-potential molecular dynamics simulations to analyse the double-layer structure and capacitive performance of supercapacitors composed of conductive metal–organic framework (MOF) electrodes and ionic liquids. The molecular modelling clarifies how ions transport and reside inside polarized porous MOFs, and then predicts the corresponding potential-dependent capacitance in characteristic shapes. The transmission line model was adopted to characterize the charging dynamics, which further allowed evaluation of the capacitive performance of this class of supercapacitors at the macroscale from the simulation-obtained data at the nanoscale. These ‘computational microscopy’ results were supported by macroscopic electrochemical measurements. Such a combined nanoscale-to-macroscale investigation demonstrates the potential of MOF supercapacitors for achieving unprecedentedly high volumetric energy and power densities. It gives molecular insights into preferred structures of MOFs for accomplishing consistent performance with optimal energy–power balance, providing a blueprint for future characterization and design of these new supercapacitor systems."
321,Concurrence of quantum anomalous Hall and topological Hall effects in magnetic topological insulator sandwich heterostructures,2020-02-03,"The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is a consequence of non-zero Berry curvature in momentum space. The QAH insulator harbours dissipation-free chiral edge states in the absence of an external magnetic field. However, the topological Hall (TH) effect, a hallmark of chiral spin textures, is a consequence of real-space Berry curvature. Here, by inserting a topological insulator (TI) layer between two magnetic TI layers, we realized the concurrence of the TH effect and the QAH effect through electric-field gating. The TH effect is probed by bulk carriers, whereas the QAH effect is characterized by chiral edge states. The appearance of the TH effect in the QAH insulating regime is a consequence of chiral magnetic domain walls that result from the gate-induced Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction and occurs during the magnetization reversal process in the magnetic TI sandwich samples. The coexistence of chiral edge states and chiral spin textures provides a platform for proof-of-concept dissipationless spin-textured spintronic applications."
322,Coexistence of large conventional and planar spin Hall effect with long spin diffusion length in a low-symmetry semimetal at room temperature,2020-02-03,"The spin Hall effect (SHE) is usually observed as a bulk effect in high-symmetry crystals with substantial spin–orbit coupling (SOC), where the symmetric spin–orbit field imposes a widely encountered trade-off between spin Hall angle (θSH) and spin diffusion length (Lsf), and spin polarization, spin current and charge current are constrained to be mutually orthogonal. Here, we report a large θSH of 0.32 accompanied by a long Lsf of 2.2 μm at room temperature in a low-symmetry few-layered semimetal MoTe2, thus identifying it as an excellent candidate for simultaneous spin generation, transport and detection. In addition, we report that longitudinal spin current with out-of-plane polarization can be generated by both transverse and vertical charge current, due to the conventional and a newly observed planar SHE, respectively. Our study suggests that manipulation of crystalline symmetries and strong SOC opens access to new charge-spin interconversion configurations and spin–orbit torques for spintronic applications."
323,Cubic ice Ic without stacking defects obtained from ice XVII,2020-02-03,"Amongst the more than 18 different forms of water ice, only the common hexagonal phase and the cubic phase are present in nature on Earth. Nonetheless, it is now widely recognized that all samples of ‘cubic ice’ discovered so far do not have a fully cubic crystal structure but instead are stacking-disordered forms of ice I (namely, ice Isd), which contain both hexagonal and cubic stacking sequences of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. Here, we describe a method to obtain large quantities of cubic ice Ic with high structural purity. Cubic ice Ic is formed by heating a powder of D2O ice XVII obtained from annealing of pristine C0 hydrate samples under dynamic vacuum. Neutron diffraction experiments performed on two different instruments and Raman spectroscopy measurements confirm the structural purity of the cubic ice, Ic. These findings contribute to a better understanding of ice I polymorphism and the existence of the two natural ice forms."
324,Design of van der Waals interfaces for broad-spectrum optoelectronics,2020-02-03,"Van der Waals (vdW) interfaces based on 2D materials are promising for optoelectronics, as interlayer transitions between different compounds allow tailoring of the spectral response over a broad range. However, issues such as lattice mismatch or a small misalignment of the constituent layers can drastically suppress electron–photon coupling for these interlayer transitions. Here, we engineered type-II interfaces by assembling atomically thin crystals that have the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band at the Γ point, and thus avoid any momentum mismatch. We found that these van der Waals interfaces exhibit radiative optical transitions irrespective of the lattice constant, the rotational and/or translational alignment of the two layers or whether the constituent materials are direct or indirect gap semiconductors. Being robust and of general validity, our results broaden the scope of future optoelectronics device applications based on two-dimensional materials."
325,Enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from organic semiconductor heterojunction nanoparticles,2020-02-03,"Photocatalysts formed from a single organic semiconductor typically suffer from inefficient intrinsic charge generation, which leads to low photocatalytic activities. We demonstrate that incorporating a heterojunction between a donor polymer (PTB7-Th) and non-fullerene acceptor (EH-IDTBR) in organic nanoparticles (NPs) can result in hydrogen evolution photocatalysts with greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity. Control of the nanomorphology of these NPs was achieved by varying the stabilizing surfactant employed during NP fabrication, converting it from a core–shell structure to an intermixed donor/acceptor blend and increasing H2 evolution by an order of magnitude. The resulting photocatalysts display an unprecedentedly high H2 evolution rate of over 60,000 µmol h−1 g−1 under 350 to 800 nm illumination, and external quantum efficiencies over 6% in the region of maximum solar photon flux."
326,Self-accelerated corrosion of nuclear waste forms at material interfaces,2020-01-27,"The US plan for high-level nuclear waste includes the immobilization of long-lived radionuclides in glass or ceramic waste forms in stainless-steel canisters for disposal in deep geological repositories. Here we report that, under simulated repository conditions, corrosion could be significantly accelerated at the interfaces of different barrier materials, which has not been considered in the current safety and performance assessment models. Severe localized corrosion was found at the interfaces between stainless steel and a model nuclear waste glass and between stainless steel and a ceramic waste form. The accelerated corrosion can be attributed to changes of solution chemistry and local acidity/alkalinity within a confined space, which significantly alter the corrosion of both the waste-form materials and the metallic canisters. The corrosion that is accelerated by the interface interaction between dissimilar materials could profoundly impact the service life of the nuclear waste packages, which, therefore, should be carefully considered when evaluating the performance of waste forms and their packages. Moreover, compatible barriers should be selected to further optimize the performance of the geological repository system."
327,Rapid fabrication of precise high-throughput filters from membrane protein nanosheets,2020-01-27,"Biological membranes are ideal for separations as they provide high permeability while maintaining high solute selectivity due to the presence of specialized membrane protein (MP) channels. However, successful integration of MPs into manufactured membranes has remained a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate a two-hour organic solvent method to develop 2D crystals and nanosheets of highly packed pore-forming MPs in block copolymers (BCPs). We then integrate these hybrid materials into scalable MP-BCP biomimetic membranes. These MP-BCP nanosheet membranes maintain the molecular selectivity of the three types of β-barrel MP channels used, with pore sizes of 0.8 nm, 1.3 nm, and 1.5 nm. These biomimetic membranes demonstrate water permeability that is 20–1,000 times greater than that of commercial membranes and 1.5–45 times greater than that of the latest research membranes with comparable molecular exclusion ratings. This approach could provide high performance alternatives in the challenging sub-nanometre to few-nanometre size range."
328,Quantum dot solids showing state-resolved band-like transport,2020-01-27,"Improving charge mobility in quantum dot (QD) films is important for the performance of photodetectors, solar cells and light-emitting diodes. However, these applications also require preservation of well defined QD electronic states and optical transitions. Here, we present HgTe QD films that show high mobility for charges transported through discrete QD states. A hybrid surface passivation process efficiently eliminates surface states, provides tunable air-stable n and p doping and enables hysteresis-free filling of QD states evidenced by strong conductance modulation. QD films dried at room temperature without any post-treatments exhibit mobility up to μ ~ 8 cm2 V−1 s−1 at a low carrier density of less than one electron per QD, band-like behaviour down to 77 K, and similar drift and Hall mobilities at all temperatures. This unprecedented set of electronic properties raises important questions about the delocalization and hopping mechanisms for transport in QD solids, and introduces opportunities for improving QD technologies."
329,Protease-activated receptor signalling initiates α,2020-01-20,"Haematopoietic cells and platelets employ G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to sense extracellular information and respond by initiating integrin-mediated adhesion. So far, such processes have not been demonstrated in non-haematopoietic cells. Here, we report that the activation of protease-activated receptors PAR1 and PAR2 induce multiple signalling pathways to establish α5β1-integrin-mediated adhesion. First, PARs signal via Gβγ and PI3K to α5β1-integrins to adopt a talin- and kindlin-dependent high-affinity conformation, which triggers fibronectin binding and initiates cell adhesion. Then, within 60 s, PARs signal via Gα13, Gαi, ROCK and Src to strengthen the α5β1-integrin-mediated adhesion. Furthermore, PAR signalling changes the abundance of numerous proteins in the adhesome assembled by α5β1-integrins, including Gα13, vacuolar protein-sorting-associated protein 36, and band 4.1-like protein 4B or 5, and accelerates cell adhesion maturation, spreading and migration. The mechanistic insights describe how agonist binding to PAR employs GPCR and integrin-signalling pathways to initiate and regulate adhesion and to guide physiological responses of non-haematopoietic cells."
330,Fatigue of graphene,2020-01-20,"Materials can suffer mechanical fatigue when subjected to cyclic loading at stress levels much lower than the ultimate tensile strength, and understanding this behaviour is critical to evaluating long-term dynamic reliability. The fatigue life and damage mechanisms of two-dimensional (2D) materials, of interest for mechanical and electronic applications, are currently unknown. Here, we present a fatigue study of freestanding 2D materials, specifically graphene and graphene oxide (GO). Using atomic force microscopy, monolayer and few-layer graphene were found to exhibit a fatigue life of more than 109 cycles at a mean stress of 71 GPa and a stress range of 5.6 GPa, higher than any material reported so far. Fatigue failure in monolayer graphene is global and catastrophic without progressive damage, while molecular dynamics simulations reveal this is preceded by stress-mediated bond reconfigurations near defective sites. Conversely, functional groups in GO impart a local and progressive fatigue damage mechanism. This study not only provides fundamental insights into the fatigue enhancement behaviour of graphene-embedded nanocomposites, but also serves as a starting point for the dynamic reliability evaluation of other 2D materials."
331,Voltage decay and redox asymmetry mitigation by reversible cation migration in lithium-rich layered oxide electrodes,2020-01-20,"Despite the high energy density of lithium-rich layered-oxide electrodes, their real-world implementation in batteries is hindered by the substantial voltage decay on cycling. This voltage decay is widely accepted to mainly originate from progressive structural rearrangements involving irreversible transition-metal migration. As prevention of this spontaneous cation migration has proven difficult, a paradigm shift toward management of its reversibility is needed. Herein, we demonstrate that the reversibility of the cation migration of lithium-rich nickel manganese oxides can be remarkably improved by altering the oxygen stacking sequences in the layered structure and thereby dramatically reducing the voltage decay. The preeminent intra-cycle reversibility of the cation migration is experimentally visualized, and first-principles calculations reveal that an O2-type structure restricts the movements of transition metals within the Li layer, which effectively streamlines the returning migration path of the transition metals. Furthermore, we propose that the enhanced reversibility mitigates the asymmetry of the anionic redox in conventional lithium-rich electrodes, promoting the high-potential anionic reduction, thereby reducing the subsequent voltage hysteresis. Our findings demonstrate that regulating the reversibility of the cation migration is a practical strategy to reduce voltage decay and hysteresis in lithium-rich layered materials."
332,Thiol-free self-assembled oligoethylene glycols enable robust air-stable molecular electronics,2020-01-20,"Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are widely used to engineer the surface properties of metals. The relatively simple and versatile chemistry of metal–thiolate bonds makes thiolate SAMs the preferred option in a range of applications, yet fragility and a tendency to oxidize in air limit their long-term use. Here, we report the formation of thiol-free self-assembled mono- and bilayers of glycol ethers, which bind to the surface of coinage metals through the spontaneous chemisorption of glycol ether-functionalized fullerenes. As-prepared assemblies are bilayers presenting fullerene cages at both the substrate and ambient interface. Subsequent exposure to functionalized glycol ethers displaces the topmost layer of glycol ether-functionalized fullerenes, and the resulting assemblies expose functional groups to the ambient interface. These layers exhibit the key properties of thiolate SAMs, yet they are stable to ambient conditions for several weeks, as shown by the performance of tunnelling junctions formed from SAMs of alkyl-functionalized glycol ethers. Glycol ether-functionalized spiropyrans incorporated into mixed monolayers lead to reversible, light-driven conductance switching. Self-assemblies of glycol ethers are drop-in replacements for thiolate SAMs that retain all of their useful properties while avoiding the drawbacks of metal–thiolate bonds."
333,Clarifying the relationship between redox activity and electrochemical stability in solid electrolytes,2020-01-13,"All-solid-state Li-ion batteries promise safer electrochemical energy storage with larger volumetric and gravimetric energy densities. A major concern is the limited electrochemical stability of solid electrolytes and related detrimental electrochemical reactions, especially because of our restricted understanding. Here we demonstrate for the argyrodite-, garnet- and NASICON-type solid electrolytes that the favourable decomposition pathway is indirect rather than direct, via (de)lithiated states of the solid electrolyte, into the thermodynamically stable decomposition products. The consequence is that the electrochemical stability window of the solid electrolyte is notably larger than predicted for direct decomposition, rationalizing the observed stability window. The observed argyrodite metastable (de)lithiated solid electrolyte phases contribute to the (ir)reversible cycling capacity of all-solid-state batteries, in addition to the contribution of the decomposition products, comprehensively explaining solid electrolyte redox activity. The fundamental nature of the proposed mechanism suggests this is a key aspect for solid electrolytes in general, guiding interface and material design for all-solid-state batteries."
334,Atomic-level tuning of Co–N–C catalyst for high-performance electrochemical H,2020-01-13,"Despite the growing demand for hydrogen peroxide it is almost exclusively manufactured by the energy-intensive anthraquinone process. Alternatively, H2O2 can be produced electrochemically via the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction, although the performance of the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts is insufficient to meet the demands for industrialization. Interestingly, guided by first-principles calculations, we found that the catalytic properties of the Co–N4 moiety can be tailored by fine-tuning its surrounding atomic configuration to resemble the structure-dependent catalytic properties of metalloenzymes. Using this principle, we designed and synthesized a single-atom electrocatalyst that comprises an optimized Co–N4 moiety incorporated in nitrogen-doped graphene for H2O2 production and exhibits a kinetic current density of 2.8 mA cm−2 (at 0.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) and a mass activity of 155 A g−1 (at 0.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) with negligible activity loss over 110 hours."
335,Ordered three-dimensional nanomaterials using DNA-prescribed and valence-controlled material voxels,2020-01-13,"The ability to organize nanoscale objects into well-defined three-dimensional (3D) arrays can translate advances in nanoscale synthesis into targeted material fabrication. Despite successes in nanoparticle assembly, most extant methods are system specific and not fully compatible with biomolecules. Here, we report a platform for creating distinct 3D ordered arrays from different nanomaterials using DNA-prescribed and valence-controlled material voxels. These material voxels consist of 3D DNA frames that integrate nano-objects within their scaffold, thus enabling the object’s valence and coordination to be determined by the frame’s vertices, which can bind to each other through hybridization. Such DNA material voxels define the lattice symmetry through the spatially prescribed valence decoupling the 3D assembly process from the nature of the nanocomponents, such as their intrinsic properties and shapes. We show this by assembling metallic and semiconductor nanoparticles and also protein superlattices. We support the technological potential of such an assembly approach by fabricating light-emitting 3D arrays with diffraction-limited spectral purity and 3D enzymatic arrays with increased activity."
336,The entry of nanoparticles into solid tumours,2020-01-13,"The concept of nanoparticle transport through gaps between endothelial cells (inter-endothelial gaps) in the tumour blood vessel is a central paradigm in cancer nanomedicine. The size of these gaps was found to be up to 2,000 nm. This justified the development of nanoparticles to treat solid tumours as their size is small enough to extravasate and access the tumour microenvironment. Here we show that these inter-endothelial gaps are not responsible for the transport of nanoparticles into solid tumours. Instead, we found that up to 97% of nanoparticles enter tumours using an active process through endothelial cells. This result is derived from analysis of four different mouse models, three different types of human tumours, mathematical simulation and modelling, and two different types of imaging techniques. These results challenge our current rationale for developing cancer nanomedicine and suggest that understanding these active pathways will unlock strategies to enhance tumour accumulation."
337,Syndecan-4 tunes cell mechanics by activating the kindlin-integrin-RhoA pathway,2020-01-06,"Extensive research over the past decades has identified integrins to be the primary transmembrane receptors that enable cells to respond to external mechanical cues. We reveal here a mechanism whereby syndecan-4 tunes cell mechanics in response to localized tension via a coordinated mechanochemical signalling response that involves activation of two other receptors: epidermal growth factor receptor and β1 integrin. Tension on syndecan-4 induces cell-wide activation of the kindlin-2/β1 integrin/RhoA axis in a PI3K-dependent manner. Furthermore, syndecan-4-mediated tension at the cell–extracellular matrix interface is required for yes-associated protein activation. Extracellular tension on syndecan-4 triggers a conformational change in the cytoplasmic domain, the variable region of which is indispensable for the mechanical adaptation to force, facilitating the assembly of a syndecan-4/α-actinin/F-actin molecular scaffold at the bead adhesion. This mechanotransduction pathway for syndecan-4 should have immediate implications for the broader field of mechanobiology."
338,Tunable room-temperature spin galvanic and spin Hall effects in van der Waals heterostructures,2020-01-06,"Spin–orbit coupling stands as a powerful tool to interconvert charge and spin currents and to manipulate the magnetization of magnetic materials through spin-torque phenomena. However, despite the diversity of existing bulk materials and the recent advent of interfacial and low-dimensional effects, control of this interconversion at room temperature remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate strongly enhanced room-temperature spin-to-charge interconversion in graphene driven by the proximity of WS2. By performing spin precession experiments in appropriately designed Hall bars, we separate the contributions of the spin Hall and the spin galvanic effects. Remarkably, their corresponding conversion efficiencies can be tailored by electrostatic gating in magnitude and sign, peaking near the charge neutrality point with an equivalent magnitude that is comparable to the largest efficiencies reported to date. Such electric-field tunability provides a building block for spin generation free from magnetic materials and for ultra-compact magnetic memory technologies."
339,Dimensionally and environmentally ultra-stable polymer composites reinforced with carbon fibres,2019-12-23,"The quest to develop materials that enable the manufacture of dimensionally ultra-stable structures for critical-dimension components in spacecraft has led to much research over many decades and the evolution of carbon fibre reinforced polymer materials. This has resulted in structural designs that feature a near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion. However, the dimensional instabilities that result from moisture ingression and release remain the fundamental vulnerability of the matrix, which restricts many applications. Here, we address this challenge by developing a space-qualifiable physical surface barrier that blends within the mechanical properties of the composite, thus becoming part of the composite itself. The resulting enhanced composite features mechanical integrity and a strength that is superior to the underlying composite, while remaining impervious to moisture and outgassing. We demonstrate production capability for a model-sized component for the Sentinel-5 mission and demonstrate such capability for future European Space Agency (ESA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) programmes such as Copernicus Extension, Earth Explorer and Science Cosmic Visions."
340,Nanoscale percolation in doped BaZrO,2019-12-23,"Acceptor-doped barium zirconate is a promising proton-conducting oxide for various applications, for example, electrolysers, fuel cells or methane-conversion cells. Despite many experimental and theoretical investigations there is, however, only a limited understanding as to how to connect the complex microscopic proton motion and the macroscopic proton conductivity for the full range of acceptor levels, from diluted acceptors to concentrated solid solutions. Here we show that a combination of density functional theory calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations enables this connection. At low concentrations, acceptors trap protons, which results in a decrease of the average proton mobility. With increasing concentration, however, acceptors form nanoscale percolation pathways with low proton migration energies, which leads to a strong increase of the proton mobility and conductivity. Comparing our simulated proton conductivities with experimental values for yttrium-doped barium zirconate yields excellent agreement. We then predict that ordered dopant structures would not only strongly enhance the proton conductivities, but would also enable one- or two-dimensional proton conduction in barium zirconate. Finally, we show how the properties of other dopants influence the proton conductivity."
341,Targeted chemical pressure yields tuneable millimetre-wave dielectric,2019-12-23,"Epitaxial strain can unlock enhanced properties in oxide materials, but restricts substrate choice and maximum film thickness, above which lattice relaxation and property degradation occur. Here we employ a chemical alternative to epitaxial strain by providing targeted chemical pressure, distinct from random doping, to induce a ferroelectric instability with the strategic introduction of barium into today’s best millimetre-wave tuneable dielectric, the epitaxially strained 50-nm-thick n = 6 (SrTiO3)nSrO Ruddlesden–Popper dielectric grown on (110) DyScO3. The defect mitigating nature of (SrTiO3)nSrO results in unprecedented low loss at frequencies up to 125 GHz. No barium-containing Ruddlesden–Popper titanates are known, but the resulting atomically engineered superlattice material, (SrTiO3)n−m(BaTiO3)mSrO, enables low-loss, tuneable dielectric properties to be achieved with lower epitaxial strain and a 200% improvement in the figure of merit at commercially relevant millimetre-wave frequencies. As tuneable dielectrics are key constituents of emerging millimetre-wave high-frequency devices in telecommunications, our findings could lead to higher performance adaptive and reconfigurable electronics at these frequencies."
342,Programming nanoparticle valence bonds with single-stranded DNA encoders,2019-12-23,"Nature has evolved strategies to encode information within a single biopolymer to program biomolecular interactions with characteristic stoichiometry, orthogonality and reconfigurability. Nevertheless, synthetic approaches for programming molecular reactions or assembly generally rely on the use of multiple polymer chains (for example, patchy particles). Here we demonstrate a method for patterning colloidal gold nanoparticles with valence bond analogues using single-stranded DNA encoders containing polyadenine (polyA). By programming the order, length and sequence of each encoder with alternating polyA/non-polyA domains, we synthesize programmable atom-like nanoparticles (PANs) with n-valence that can be used to assemble a spectrum of low-coordination colloidal molecules with different composition, size, chirality and linearity. Moreover, by exploiting the reconfigurability of PANs, we demonstrate dynamic colloidal bond-breaking and bond-formation reactions, structural rearrangement and even the implementation of Boolean logic operations. This approach may be useful for generating responsive functional materials for distinct technological applications."
343,"A transparent, self-healing and high-",2019-12-16,"Stretchable optoelectronic materials are essential for applications in wearable electronics, human–machine interfaces and soft robots. However, intrinsically stretchable optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting capacitors usually require high driving alternating voltages and excitation frequencies to achieve sufficient luminance in ambient lighting conditions. Here, we present a healable, low-field illuminating optoelectronic stretchable (HELIOS) device by introducing a transparent, high permittivity polymeric dielectric material. The HELIOS device turns on at an alternating voltage of 23 V and a frequency below 1 kHz, safe operating conditions for human–machine interactions. We achieved a brightness of 1,460 cd m−2 at 2.5 V µm−1 with stable illumination demonstrated up to a maximum of 800% strain. The materials also self-healed mechanically and electronically from punctures or when severed. We further demonstrate various HELIOS light-emitting capacitor devices in environment sensing using optical feedback. Moreover, our devices can be powered wirelessly, potentially enabling applications for untethered damage-resilient soft robots."
344,Quantitative production of butenes from biomass-derived γ-valerolactone catalysed by hetero-atomic MFI zeolite,2019-12-16,"The efficient production of light olefins from renewable biomass is a vital and challenging target to achieve future sustainable chemical processes. Here we report a hetero-atomic MFI-type zeolite (NbAlS-1), over which aqueous solutions of γ-valerolactone (GVL), obtained from biomass-derived carbohydrates, can be quantitatively converted into butenes with a yield of >99% at ambient pressure under continuous flow conditions. NbAlS-1 incorporates simultaneously niobium(v) and aluminium(iii) centres into the framework and thus has a desirable distribution of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites with optimal strength. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and absorption spectroscopy show that there is cooperativity between Nb(v) and the Brønsted acid sites on the confined adsorption of GVL, whereas the catalytic mechanism for the conversion of the confined GVL into butenes is revealed by in situ inelastic neutron scattering, coupled with modelling. This study offers a prospect for the sustainable production of butene as a platform chemical for the manufacture of renewable materials."
345,Multi-messenger nanoprobes of hidden magnetism in a strained manganite,2019-12-16,"The ground-state properties of correlated electron systems can be extraordinarily sensitive to external stimuli, offering abundant platforms for functional materials. Using the multi-messenger combination of atomic force microscopy, cryogenic scanning near-field optical microscopy, magnetic force microscopy and ultrafast laser excitation, we demonstrate both ‘writing’ and ‘erasing’ of a metastable ferromagnetic metal phase in strained films of La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (LCMO) with nanometre-resolved finesse. By tracking both optical conductivity and magnetism at the nanoscale, we reveal how strain-coupling underlies the dynamic growth, spontaneous nanotexture and first-order melting transition of this hidden photoinduced metal. Our first-principles calculations reveal that epitaxially engineered Jahn–Teller distortion can stabilize nearly degenerate antiferromagnetic insulator and ferromagnetic metal phases. We propose a Ginzburg–Landau description to rationalize the co-active interplay of strain, lattice distortions and magnetism nano-resolved here in strained LCMO, thus guiding future functional engineering of epitaxial oxides into the regime of phase-programmable materials."
346,Thermoplastic moulding of regenerated silk,2019-12-16,"Early insights into the unique structure and properties of native silk suggested that β-sheet nanocrystallites in silk would degrade prior to melting when subjected to thermal processing. Since then, canonical approaches for fabricating silk-based materials typically involve solution-derived processing methods, which have inherent limitations with respect to silk protein solubility and stability in solution, and time and cost efficiency. Here we report a thermal processing method for the direct solid-state moulding of regenerated silk into bulk ‘parts’ or devices with tunable mechanical properties. At elevated temperature and pressure, regenerated amorphous silk nanomaterials with ultralow β-sheet content undergo thermal fusion via molecular rearrangement and self-assembly assisted by bound water to form a robust bulk material that retains biocompatibility, degradability and machinability. This technique reverses presumptions about the limitations of direct thermal processing of silk into a wide range of new material formats and composite materials with tailored properties and functionalities."
347,Biofuel powered glucose detection in bodily fluids with an n-type conjugated polymer,2019-12-16,"A promising class of materials for applications that rely on electron transfer for signal generation are the n-type semiconducting polymers. Here we demonstrate the integration of an n-type conjugated polymer with a redox enzyme for the autonomous detection of glucose and power generation from bodily fluids. The reversible, mediator-free, miniaturized glucose sensor is an enzyme-coupled organic electrochemical transistor with a detection range of six orders of magnitude. This n-type polymer is also used as an anode and paired with a polymeric cathode in an enzymatic fuel cell to convert the chemical energy of glucose and oxygen into electrical power. The all-polymer biofuel cell shows a performance that scales with the glucose content in the solution and a stability that exceeds 30 days. Moreover, at physiologically relevant glucose concentrations and from fluids such as human saliva, it generates enough power to operate an organic electrochemical transistor, thus contributes to the technological advancement of self-powered micrometre-scale sensors and actuators that run on metabolites produced in the body."
348,Mutant lamins cause nuclear envelope rupture and DNA damage in skeletal muscle cells,2019-12-16,"Mutations in the LMNA gene, which encodes the nuclear envelope (NE) proteins lamins A/C, cause Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophy and other diseases collectively known as laminopathies. The mechanisms responsible for these diseases remain incompletely understood. Using three mouse models of muscle laminopathies and muscle biopsies from individuals with LMNA-related muscular dystrophy, we found that Lmna mutations reduced nuclear stability and caused transient rupture of the NE in skeletal muscle cells, resulting in DNA damage, DNA damage response activation and reduced cell viability. NE and DNA damage resulted from nuclear migration during skeletal muscle maturation and correlated with disease severity in the mouse models. Reduction of cytoskeletal forces on the myonuclei prevented NE damage and rescued myofibre function and viability in Lmna mutant myofibres, indicating that myofibre dysfunction is the result of mechanically induced NE damage. Taken together, these findings implicate mechanically induced DNA damage as a pathogenic contributor to LMNA skeletal muscle diseases."
349,Taxanes convert regions of perturbed microtubule growth into rescue sites,2019-12-09,"Microtubules are polymers of tubulin dimers, and conformational transitions in the microtubule lattice drive microtubule dynamic instability and affect various aspects of microtubule function. The exact nature of these transitions and their modulation by anticancer drugs such as Taxol and epothilone, which can stabilize microtubules but also perturb their growth, are poorly understood. Here, we directly visualize the action of fluorescent Taxol and epothilone derivatives and show that microtubules can transition to a state that triggers cooperative drug binding to form regions with altered lattice conformation. Such regions emerge at growing microtubule ends that are in a pre-catastrophe state, and inhibit microtubule growth and shortening. Electron microscopy and in vitro dynamics data indicate that taxane accumulation zones represent incomplete tubes that can persist, incorporate tubulin dimers and repeatedly induce microtubule rescues. Thus, taxanes modulate the material properties of microtubules by converting destabilized growing microtubule ends into regions resistant to depolymerization."
350,Dirac fermions and flat bands in the ideal kagome metal FeSn,2019-12-09,"A kagome lattice of 3d transition metal ions is a versatile platform for correlated topological phases hosting symmetry-protected electronic excitations and magnetic ground states. However, the paradigmatic states of the idealized two-dimensional kagome lattice—Dirac fermions and flat bands—have not been simultaneously observed. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and de Haas–van Alphen quantum oscillations to reveal coexisting surface and bulk Dirac fermions as well as flat bands in the antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeSn, which has spatially decoupled kagome planes. Our band structure calculations and matrix element simulations demonstrate that the bulk Dirac bands arise from in-plane localized Fe-3d orbitals, and evidence that the coexisting Dirac surface state realizes a rare example of fully spin-polarized two-dimensional Dirac fermions due to spin-layer locking in FeSn. The prospect to harness these prototypical excitations in a kagome lattice is a frontier of great promise at the confluence of topology, magnetism and strongly correlated physics."
351,Hydrophilic microporous membranes for selective ion separation and flow-battery energy storage,2019-12-02,"Membranes with fast and selective ion transport are widely used for water purification and devices for energy conversion and storage including fuel cells, redox flow batteries and electrochemical reactors. However, it remains challenging to design cost-effective, easily processed ion-conductive membranes with well-defined pore architectures. Here, we report a new approach to designing membranes with narrow molecular-sized channels and hydrophilic functionality that enable fast transport of salt ions and high size-exclusion selectivity towards small organic molecules. These membranes, based on polymers of intrinsic microporosity containing Tröger’s base or amidoxime groups, demonstrate that exquisite control over subnanometre pore structure, the introduction of hydrophilic functional groups and thickness control all play important roles in achieving fast ion transport combined with high molecular selectivity. These membranes enable aqueous organic flow batteries with high energy efficiency and high capacity retention, suggesting their utility for a variety of energy-related devices and water purification processes."
352,Synthesis of orthogonally assembled 3D cross-stacked metal oxide semiconducting nanowires,2019-12-02,"Assemblies of metal oxide nanowires in 3D stacks can enable the realization of nanodevices with tailored conductivity, porous structure and a high surface area. Current fabrication methods require complicated multistep procedures that involve the initial preparation of nanowires followed by manual assembly or transfer printing, and thus lack synthesis flexibility and controllability. Here we report a general synthetic orthogonal assembly approach to controllably construct 3D multilayer-crossed metal oxide nanowire arrays. Taking tungsten oxide semiconducting nanowires as an example, we show the spontaneous orthogonal packing of composite nanorods of poly(ethylene oxide)-block-polystyrene and silicotungstic acid; the following calcination gives rise to 3D cross-stacked nanowire arrays of Si-doped metastable ε-phase WO3. This nanowire stack framework was also tested as a gas detector for the selective sensing of acetone. By using other polyoxometallates, this fabrication method for woodpile-like 3D nanostructures can also be generalized to different doped metal oxide nanowires, which provides a way to manipulate their physical properties for various applications."
353,Tunable quadruple-well ferroelectric van der Waals crystals,2019-11-18,"The family of layered thio- and seleno-phosphates has gained attention as potential control dielectrics for the rapidly growing family of two-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional electronic materials. Here we report a combination of density functional theory calculations, quantum molecular dynamics simulations and variable-temperature, -pressure and -bias piezoresponse force microscopy data to predict and verify the existence of an unusual ferroelectric property—a uniaxial quadruple potential well for Cu displacements—enabled by the van der Waals gap in copper indium thiophosphate (CuInP2S6). The calculated potential energy landscape for Cu displacements is strongly influenced by strain, accounting for the origin of the negative piezoelectric coefficient and rendering CuInP2S6 a rare example of a uniaxial multi-well ferroelectric. Experimental data verify the coexistence of four polarization states and explore the temperature-, pressure- and bias-dependent piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties, which are supported by bias-dependent molecular dynamics simulations. These phenomena offer new opportunities for both fundamental studies and applications in data storage and electronics."
354,Ultrasoft slip-mediated bending in few-layer graphene,2019-11-11,"Continuum scaling laws often break down when materials approach atomic length scales, reflecting changes in their underlying physics and the opportunities to access unconventional properties. These continuum limits are evident in two-dimensional materials, where there is no consensus on their bending stiffnesses or how they scale with thickness. Through combined computational and electron microscopy experiments, we measure the bending stiffness of graphene, obtaining 1.2–1.7 eV for a monolayer. Moreover, we find that the bending stiffness of few-layer graphene decreases sharply as a function of bending angle, tuning by almost 400% for trilayer graphene. This softening results from shear, slip and the onset of superlubricity between the atomic layers and corresponds with a gradual change in scaling power from cubic to linear. Our results provide a unified model for bending in two-dimensional materials and show that their multilayers can be orders of magnitude softer than previously thought, among the most flexible electronic materials currently known."
355,Three-dimensional printing of multicomponent glasses using phase-separating resins,2019-11-11,"The digital fabrication of oxide glasses by three-dimensional (3D) printing represents a major paradigm shift in the way glasses are designed and manufactured, opening opportunities to explore functionalities inaccessible by current technologies. The few enticing examples of 3D printed glasses are limited in their chemical compositions and suffer from the low resolution achievable with particle-based or molten glass technologies. Here, we report a digital light-processing 3D printing platform that exploits the photopolymerization-induced phase separation of hybrid resins to create glass parts with complex shapes, high spatial resolutions and multi-oxide chemical compositions. Analogously to conventional porous glass fabrication methods, we exploit phase separation phenomena to fabricate complex glass parts displaying light-controlled multiscale porosity and dense multicomponent transparent glasses with arbitrary geometry using a desktop printer. Because most functional properties of glasses emerge from their transparency and multicomponent nature, this 3D printing platform may be useful for distinct technologies, sciences and arts."
356,Extracellular matrix anisotropy is determined by TFAP2C-dependent regulation of cell collisions,2019-10-28,"The isotropic or anisotropic organization of biological extracellular matrices has important consequences for tissue function. We study emergent anisotropy using fibroblasts that generate varying degrees of matrix alignment from uniform starting conditions. This reveals that the early migratory paths of fibroblasts are correlated with subsequent matrix organization. Combined experimentation and adaptation of Vicsek modelling demonstrates that the reorientation of cells relative to each other following collision plays a role in generating matrix anisotropy. We term this behaviour ‘cell collision guidance’. The transcription factor TFAP2C regulates cell collision guidance in part by controlling the expression of RND3. RND3 localizes to cell–cell collision zones where it downregulates actomyosin activity. Cell collision guidance fails without this mechanism in place, leading to isotropic matrix generation. The cross-referencing of alignment and TFAP2C gene expression signatures against existing datasets enables the identification and validation of several classes of pharmacological agents that disrupt matrix anisotropy."
357,Stopping transformed cancer cell growth by rigidity sensing,2019-10-28,"A common feature of cancer cells is the alteration of kinases and biochemical signalling pathways enabling transformed growth on soft matrices, whereas cytoskeletal protein alterations are thought to be a secondary issue. However, we report here that cancer cells from different tissues can be toggled between transformed and rigidity-dependent growth states by the absence or presence of mechanosensory modules, respectively. In various cancer lines from different tissues, cells had over tenfold fewer rigidity-sensing contractions compared with normal cells from the same tissues. Restoring normal levels of cytoskeletal proteins, including tropomyosins, restored rigidity sensing and rigidity-dependent growth. Further depletion of other rigidity sensor proteins, including myosin IIA, restored transformed growth and blocked sensing. In addition, restoration of rigidity sensing to cancer cells inhibited tumour formation and changed expression patterns. Thus, the depletion of rigidity-sensing modules through alterations in cytoskeletal protein levels enables cancer cell growth on soft surfaces, which is an enabling factor for cancer progression."
358,Kinetic pathways of crystallization at the nanoscale,2019-10-28,"Nucleation and growth are universally important in systems from the atomic to the micrometre scale as they dictate structural and functional attributes of crystals. However, at the nanoscale, the pathways towards crystallization have been largely unexplored owing to the challenge of resolving the motion of individual building blocks in a liquid medium. Here we address this gap by directly imaging the full transition of dispersed gold nanoprisms to a superlattice at the single-particle level. We utilize liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy at low dose rates to control nanoparticle interactions without affecting their motions. Combining particle tracking with Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal that positional ordering of the superlattice emerges from orientational disorder. This method allows us to measure parameters such as line tension and phase coordinates, charting the nonclassical nucleation pathway involving a dense, amorphous intermediate. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach via crystallization of different nanoparticles, pointing the way to more general applications."
359,Reconfiguration of three-dimensional liquid-crystalline photonic crystals by electrostriction,2019-10-28,"Natural self-assembled three-dimensional photonic crystals such as blue-phase liquid crystals typically assume cubic lattice structures. Nonetheless, blue-phase liquid crystals with distinct crystal symmetries and thus band structures will be advantageous for optical applications. Here we use repetitive electrical pulses to reconfigure blue-phase liquid crystals into stable orthorhombic and tetragonal lattices. This approach, termed repetitively applied field, allows the system to relax between each pulse, gradually transforming the initial cubic lattice into various intermediate metastable states until a stable non-cubic crystal is achieved. We show that this technique is suitable for engineering non-cubic lattices with tailored photonic bandgaps, associated dispersion and band structure across the entire visible spectrum in blue-phase liquid crystals with distinct composition and initial crystal orientation. These field-free blue-phase liquid crystals exhibit large electro-optic responses and can be polymer-stabilized to have a wide operating temperature range and submillisecond response speed, which are promising properties for information display, electro-optics, nonlinear optics, microlasers and biosensing applications."
360,Reciprocal space imaging of ionic correlations in intercalation compounds,2019-10-21,"The intercalation of alkali ions into layered materials has played an essential role in battery technology since the development of the first lithium-ion electrodes. Coulomb repulsion between the intercalants leads to ordering of the intercalant sublattice, which hinders ionic diffusion and impacts battery performance. While conventional diffraction can identify the long-range order that can occur at discrete intercalant concentrations during the charging cycle, it cannot determine short-range order at other concentrations that also disrupt ionic mobility. In this Article, we show that the use of real-space transforms of single-crystal diffuse scattering, measured with high-energy synchrotron X-rays, allows a model-independent measurement of the temperature dependence of the length scale of ionic correlations along each of the crystallographic axes in sodium-intercalated V2O5. The techniques described here provide a new way of probing the evolution of structural ordering in crystalline materials."
361,Bias-free solar syngas production by integrating a molecular cobalt catalyst with perovskite–BiVO,2019-10-21,"The photoelectrochemical (PEC) production of syngas from water and CO2 represents an attractive technology towards a circular carbon economy. However, the high overpotential, low selectivity and cost of commonly employed catalysts pose challenges for this sustainable energy-conversion process. Here we demonstrate highly tunable PEC syngas production by integrating a cobalt porphyrin catalyst immobilized on carbon nanotubes with triple-cation mixed halide perovskite and BiVO4 photoabsorbers. Empirical data analysis is used to clarify the optimal electrode selectivity at low catalyst loadings. The perovskite photocathodes maintain selective aqueous CO2 reduction for one day at light intensities as low as 0.1 sun, which provides pathways to maximize daylight utilization by operating even under low solar irradiance. Under 1 sun irradiation, the perovskite–BiVO4 PEC tandems sustain bias-free syngas production coupled to water oxidation for three days. The devices present solar-to-H2 and solar-to-CO conversion efficiencies of 0.06 and 0.02%, respectively, and are able to operate as standalone artificial leaves in neutral pH solution."
362,Furin-mediated intracellular self-assembly of olsalazine nanoparticles for enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and tumour therapy,2019-10-21,"Among the strategies used for enhancement of tumour retention of imaging agents or anticancer drugs is the rational design of probes that undergo a tumour-specific enzymatic reaction preventing them from being pumped out of the cell. Here, the anticancer agent olsalazine (Olsa) was conjugated to the cell-penetrating peptide RVRR. Taking advantage of a biologically compatible condensation reaction, single Olsa-RVRR molecules were self-assembled into large intracellular nanoparticles by the tumour-associated enzyme furin. Both Olsa-RVRR and Olsa nanoparticles were readily detected with chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging by virtue of exchangeable Olsa hydroxyl protons. In vivo studies using HCT116 and LoVo murine xenografts showed that the OlsaCEST signal and anti-tumour therapeutic effect were 6.5- and 5.2-fold increased, respectively, compared to Olsa without RVRR, with an excellent ‘theranostic correlation’ (R2 = 0.97) between the imaging signal and therapeutic response (normalized tumour size). This furin-targeted, magnetic resonance imaging-detectable platform has potential for imaging tumour aggressiveness, drug accumulation and therapeutic response."
363,Collective topo-epitaxy in the self-assembly of a 3D quantum dot superlattice,2019-10-14,"Epitaxially fused colloidal quantum dot (QD) superlattices (epi-SLs) may enable a new class of semiconductors that combine the size-tunable photophysics of QDs with bulk-like electronic performance, but progress is hindered by a poor understanding of epi-SL formation and surface chemistry. Here we use X-ray scattering and correlative electron imaging and diffraction of individual SL grains to determine the formation mechanism of three-dimensional PbSe QD epi-SL films. We show that the epi-SL forms from a rhombohedrally distorted body centred cubic parent SL via a phase transition in which the QDs translate with minimal rotation (~10°) and epitaxially fuse across their {100} facets in three dimensions. This collective epitaxial transformation is atomically topotactic across the 103–105 QDs in each SL grain. Infilling the epi-SLs with alumina by atomic layer deposition greatly changes their electrical properties without affecting the superlattice structure. Our work establishes the formation mechanism of three-dimensional QD epi-SLs and illustrates the critical importance of surface chemistry to charge transport in these materials."
364,Mechanical dissipation via image potential states on a topological insulator surface,2019-10-14,"Joule energy loss due to resistive heating is omnipresent in today’s electronic devices whereas quantum-mechanical dissipation is largely unexplored. Here, we experimentally observe a suppression of the Joule dissipation in Bi2Te3 due to topologically protected surface states. Instead, a different type of dissipation mechanism is observed by pendulum atomic force microscopy, which is related to single-electron tunnelling resonances into image potential states that are slightly above the Bi2Te3 surface. The application of a magnetic field leads to the breakdown of the topological protection of the surface states and restores the expected Joule dissipation process. Nanomechanical energy dissipation experienced by the cantilever of the pendulum atomic force microscope provides a rich source of information on the dissipative nature of the quantum-tunnelling phenomena on the topological insulator surface, with implications for coupling a mechanical oscillator to the generic quantum material."
365,Reversible coordinative binding and separation of sulfur dioxide in a robust metal–organic framework with open copper sites,2019-10-14,"Emissions of SO2 from flue gas and marine transport have detrimental impacts on the environment and human health, but SO2 is also an important industrial feedstock if it can be recovered, stored and transported efficiently. Here we report the exceptional adsorption and separation of SO2 in a porous material, [Cu2(L)] (H4L = 4′,4‴-(pyridine-3,5-diyl)bis([1,1′-biphenyl]-3,5-dicarboxylic acid)), MFM-170. MFM-170 exhibits fully reversible SO2 uptake of 17.5 mmol g−1 at 298 K and 1.0 bar, and the SO2 binding domains for trapped molecules within MFM-170 have been determined. We report the reversible coordination of SO2 to open Cu(ii) sites, which contributes to excellent adsorption thermodynamics and selectivities for SO2 binding and facile regeneration of MFM-170 after desorption. MFM-170 is stable to water, acid and base and shows great promise for the dynamic separation of SO2 from simulated flue gas mixtures, as confirmed by breakthrough experiments."
366,Enhancement of thermoelectric performance across the topological phase transition in dense lead selenide,2019-10-07,"Alternative technologies are required in order to meet a worldwide demand for clean non-polluting energy sources. Thermoelectric generators, which generate electricity from heat in a compact and reliable manner, are potential devices for waste heat recovery. However, thermoelectric performance, as encapsulated by the figure of merit ZT, has remained at around 1.0 at room temperature, which has limited practical applications. Here, we study the effects of pressure on ZT in Cr-doped PbSe, which has a maximum ZT of less than 1.0 at a temperature of about 700 K. By applying external pressure using a diamond anvil cell, we obtained a room-temperature ZT value of about 1.7. From thermoelectric, magnetoresistance and Raman measurements, as well as density functional theory calculations, a pressure-driven topological phase transition is found to enable this enhancement. Experiments also support the appearance of a topological crystalline insulator after the transition. These findings point to the possibility of using compression to increase not just ZT in existing thermoelectric materials, but also the possibility of realizing topological crystalline insulators."
367,Imaging material functionality through three-dimensional nanoscale tracking of energy flow,2019-10-07,"The ability of energy carriers to move between atoms and molecules underlies biochemical and material function. Understanding and controlling energy flow, however, requires observing it on ultrasmall and ultrafast spatio-temporal scales, where energetic and structural roadblocks dictate the fate of energy carriers. Here, we developed a non-invasive optical scheme that leverages non-resonant interferometric scattering to track tiny changes in material polarizability created by energy carriers. We thus map evolving energy carrier distributions in four dimensions of spacetime with few-nanometre lateral precision and directly correlate them with material morphology. We visualize exciton, charge and heat transport in polyacene, silicon and perovskite semiconductors and elucidate how disorder affects energy flow in three dimensions. For example, we show that morphological boundaries in polycrystalline metal halide perovskites possess lateral- and depth-dependent resistivities, blocking lateral transport for surface but not bulk carriers. We also reveal strategies for interpreting energy transport in disordered environments that will direct the design of defect-tolerant materials for the semiconductor industry of tomorrow."
368,Directional massless Dirac fermions in a layered van der Waals material with one-dimensional long-range order,2019-10-07,"One or a few layers of van der Waals (vdW) materials are promising for applications in nanoscale electronics. Established properties include high mobility in graphene, a large direct gap in monolayer MoS2, the quantum spin Hall effect in monolayer WTe2 and so on. These exciting properties arise from electron quantum confinement in the two-dimensional limit. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to reveal directional massless Dirac fermions due to one-dimensional confinement of carriers in the layered vdW material NbSi0.45Te2. The one-dimensional directional massless Dirac fermions are protected by non-symmorphic symmetry, and emerge from a stripe-like structural modulation with long-range translational symmetry only along the stripe direction as we show using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Our work not only provides a playground for investigating further the properties of directional massless Dirac fermions, but also introduces a unique component with one-dimensional long-range order for engineering nano-electronic devices based on heterostructures of vdW materials."
369,Nanoscale semiconductor/catalyst interfaces in photoelectrochemistry,2019-10-07,"Semiconductor structures (for example, films, wires, particles) used in photoelectrochemical devices are often decorated with nanoparticles that catalyse fuel-forming reactions, including water oxidation, hydrogen evolution or carbon-dioxide reduction. For high performance, the catalyst nanoparticles must form charge-carrier-selective contacts with the underlying light-absorbing semiconductor, facilitating either hole or electron transfer while inhibiting collection of the opposite carrier. Despite the key role played by such selective contacts in photoelectrochemical energy conversion and storage, the underlying nanoscale interfaces are poorly understood because direct measurement of their properties is challenging, especially under operating conditions. Using an n-Si/Ni photoanode model system and potential-sensing atomic force microscopy, we measure interfacial electron-transfer processes and map the photovoltage generated during photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution at nanoscopic semiconductor/catalyst interfaces. We discover interfaces where the selectivity of low-Schottky-barrier n-Si/Ni contacts for holes is enhanced via a nanoscale size-dependent pinch-off effect produced when surrounding high-barrier regions develop during device operation. These results thus demonstrate (1) the ability to make nanoscale operando measurements of contact properties under practical photoelectrochemical conditions and (2) a design principle to control the flow of electrons and holes across semiconductor/catalyst junctions that is broadly relevant to different photoelectrochemical devices."
370,Ionomer distribution control in porous carbon-supported catalyst layers for high-power and low Pt-loaded proton exchange membrane fuel cells,2019-09-30,"The reduction of Pt content in the cathode for proton exchange membrane fuel cells is highly desirable to lower their costs. However, lowering the Pt loading of the cathodic electrode leads to high voltage losses. These voltage losses are known to originate from the mass transport resistance of O2 through the platinum–ionomer interface, the location of the Pt particle with respect to the carbon support and the supports’ structures. In this study, we present a new Pt catalyst/support design that substantially reduces local oxygen-related mass transport resistance. The use of chemically modified carbon supports with tailored porosity enabled controlled deposition of Pt nanoparticles on the outer and inner surface of the support particles. This resulted in an unprecedented uniform coverage of the ionomer over the high surface-area carbon supports, especially under dry operating conditions. Consequently, the present catalyst design exhibits previously unachieved fuel cell power densities in addition to high stability under voltage cycling. Thanks to the Coulombic interaction between the ionomer and N groups on the carbon support, homogeneous ionomer distribution and reproducibility during ink manufacturing process is ensured."
371,Ideal maximum strengths and defect-induced softening in nanocrystalline-nanotwinned metals,2019-09-23,"Strengthening of metals through nanoscale grain boundaries and coherent twin boundaries is manifested by a maximum strength—a phenomenon known as Hall–Petch breakdown. Different softening mechanisms are considered to occur for nanocrystalline and nanotwinned materials. Here, we report nanocrystalline-nanotwinned Ag materials that exhibit two strength transitions dissimilar from the above mechanisms. Atomistic simulations show three distinct strength regions as twin spacing decreases, delineated by positive Hall–Petch strengthening to grain-boundary-dictated (near-zero Hall–Petch slope) mechanisms and to softening (negative Hall–Petch slope) induced by twin-boundary defects. An ideal maximum strength is reached for a range of twin spacings below 7 nm. We synthesized nanocrystalline-nanotwinned Ag with hardness 3.05 GPa—42% higher than the current record, by segregating trace concentrations of Cu impurity (<1.0 weight (wt)%). The microalloy retains excellent electrical conductivity and remains stable up to 653 K; 215 K better than for pure nanotwinned Ag. This breaks the existing trade-off between strength and electrical conductivity, and demonstrates the potential for creating interface-dominated materials with unprecedented mechanical and physical properties."
372,Nodal superconducting exchange coupling,2019-09-16,"A superconducting spin valve consists of a thin-film superconductor between two ferromagnetic layers. A change of magnetization alignment shifts the superconducting transition temperature (ΔΤc) due to an interplay between the magnetic exchange energy and the superconducting condensate. The magnitude of ΔΤc scales inversely with the superconductor thickness (dS) and is zero when dS exceeds the superconducting coherence length (ξ). Here, we report a superconducting spin-valve effect involving a different underlying mechanism in which magnetization alignment and ΔΤc are determined by nodal quasiparticle excitation states on the Fermi surface of the d-wave superconductor YBa2Cu3O7–δ sandwiched between insulating layers of ferromagnetic Pr0.8Ca0.2MnO3. We observe ΔΤc values that approach 2 K with the sign of ΔΤc oscillating with dS over a length scale exceeding 100ξ and, for particular values of dS, the superconducting state reinforces an antiparallel magnetization alignment. These results pave the way to all-oxide superconducting memory in which superconductivity modulates the magnetic state."
373,Towards understanding the doping mechanism of organic semiconductors by Lewis acids,2019-09-16,"Precise doping of organic semiconductors allows control over the conductivity of these materials, an essential parameter in electronic applications. Although Lewis acids have recently shown promise as dopants for solution-processed polymers, their doping mechanism is not yet fully understood. In this study, we found that B(C6F5)3 is a superior dopant to the other Lewis acids investigated (BF3, BBr3 and AlCl3). Experiments indicate that Lewis acid–base adduct formation with polymers inhibits the doping process. Electron–nuclear double-resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, together with density functional theory, show that p-type doping occurs by generation of a water–Lewis acid complex with substantial Brønsted acidity, followed by protonation of the polymer backbone and electron transfer from a neutral chain segment to a positively charged, protonated one. This study provides insight into a potential path for protonic acid doping and shows how trace levels of water can transform Lewis acids into powerful Brønsted acids."
374,A multicolour bistable electronic shelf label based on intramolecular proton-coupled electron transfer,2019-09-09,"Bistable electrochromic materials have been explored as a viable alternative to reduce energy consumption in display applications. However, the development of ideal bistable electrochromic displays (especially multicolour displays) remains challenging due to the intrinsic limitations associated with existing electrochromic processes. Here, a bistable electrochromic device with good overall performance—including bistability (>52 h), reversibility (>12,000 cycles), colouration efficiency (≥1,240 cm2 C−1) and transmittance change (70%) with fast switching (≤1.5 s)—was designed and developed based on concerted intramolecular proton-coupled electron transfer. This approach was used to develop black, magenta, yellow and blue displays as well as a multicolour bistable electrochromic shelf label. The design principles derived from this unconventional exploration of concerted intramolecular proton-coupled electron transfer may also be useful in different optoelectronic applications."
375,Cycle stability of conversion-type iron fluoride lithium battery cathode at elevated temperatures in polymer electrolyte composites,2019-09-09,"Metal fluoride conversion cathodes offer a pathway towards developing lower-cost Li-ion batteries. Unfortunately, such cathodes suffer from extremely poor performance at elevated temperatures, which may prevent their use in large-scale energy storage applications. Here we report that replacing commonly used organic electrolytes with solid polymer electrolytes may overcome this hurdle. We demonstrate long-cycle stability for over 300 cycles at 50 °C attained in high-capacity (>450 mAh g−1) FeF2 cathodes. The absence of liquid solvents reduced electrolyte decomposition, while mechanical properties of the solid polymer electrolyte enhanced cathode structural stability. Our findings suggest that the formation of an elastic, thin and homogeneous cathode electrolyte interphase layer on active particles is a key for stable performance. The successful operation of metal fluorides at elevated temperatures opens a new avenue for their practical applications and future successful commercialization."
376,Titanium-carbide MXenes for work function and interface engineering in perovskite solar cells,2019-09-09,"To improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells, careful device design and tailored interface engineering are needed to enhance optoelectronic properties and the charge extraction process at the selective electrodes. Here, we use two-dimensional transition metal carbides (MXene Ti3C2Tx) with various termination groups (Tx) to tune the work function (WF) of the perovskite absorber and the TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL), and to engineer the perovskite/ETL interface. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations show that the addition of Ti3C2Tx to halide perovskite and TiO2 layers permits the tuning of the materials’ WFs without affecting other electronic properties. Moreover, the dipole induced by the Ti3C2Tx at the perovskite/ETL interface can be used to change the band alignment between these layers. The combined action of WF tuning and interface engineering can lead to substantial performance improvements in MXene-modified perovskite solar cells, as shown by the 26% increase of power conversion efficiency and hysteresis reduction with respect to reference cells without MXene."
377,Mapping spin–charge conversion to the band structure in a topological oxide two-dimensional electron gas,2019-09-09,"While spintronics has traditionally relied on ferromagnetic metals as spin generators and detectors, spin–orbitronics exploits the efficient spin–charge interconversion enabled by spin–orbit coupling in non-magnetic systems. Although the Rashba picture of split parabolic bands is often used to interpret such experiments, it fails to explain the largest conversion effects and their relationship with the electronic structure. Here, we demonstrate a very large spin-to-charge conversion effect in an interface-engineered, high-carrier-density SrTiO3 two-dimensional electron gas and map its gate dependence on the band structure. We show that the conversion process is amplified by enhanced Rashba-like splitting due to orbital mixing and in the vicinity of avoided band crossings with topologically non-trivial order. Our results indicate that oxide two-dimensional electron gases are strong candidates for spin-based information readout in new memory and transistor designs. Our results also emphasize the promise of topology as a new ingredient to expand the scope of complex oxides for spintronics."
378,Critical role of intermediate electronic states for spin-flip processes in charge-transfer-type organic molecules with multiple donors and acceptors,2019-09-02,"Spin-flip in purely organic molecular systems is often described as a forbidden process; however, it is commonly observed and utilized to harvest triplet excitons in a wide variety of organic material-based applications. Although the initial and final electronic states of spin-flip between the lowest singlet and lowest triplet excited state are self-evident, the exact process and the role of intermediate states through which spin-flip occurs are still far from being comprehensively determined. Here, via experimental photo-physical investigations in solution combined with first-principles quantum-mechanical calculations, we show that efficient spin-flip in multiple donor–acceptor charge-transfer-type organic molecular systems involves the critical role of an intermediate triplet excited state that corresponds to a partial molecular structure of the system. Our proposed mechanism unifies the understanding of the intersystem crossing mechanism in a wide variety of charge-transfer-type molecular systems, opening the way to greater control over spin-flip rates."
379,Room-temperature stabilization of antiferromagnetic skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets,2019-09-02,"Room-temperature skyrmions in ferromagnetic films and multilayers show promise for encoding information bits in new computing technologies. Despite recent progress, ferromagnetic order generates dipolar fields that prevent ultrasmall skyrmion sizes, and allows a transverse deflection of moving skyrmions that hinders their efficient manipulation. Antiferromagnetic skyrmions shall lift these limitations. Here we demonstrate that room-temperature antiferromagnetic skyrmions can be stabilized in synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs), in which perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, antiferromagnetic coupling and chiral order can be adjusted concurrently. Utilizing interlayer electronic coupling to an adjacent bias layer, we demonstrate that spin-spiral states obtained in a SAF with vanishing perpendicular magnetic anisotropy can be turned into isolated antiferromagnetic skyrmions. We also provide model-based estimates of skyrmion size and stability, showing that room-temperature antiferromagnetic skyrmions below 10 nm in radius can be anticipated in further optimized SAFs. Antiferromagnetic skyrmions in SAFs may thus solve major issues associated with ferromagnetic skyrmions for low-power spintronic devices."
380,Integrin nanoclusters can bridge thin matrix fibres to form cell–matrix adhesions,2019-09-02,"Integrin-mediated cell–matrix adhesions are key to sensing the geometry and rigidity of extracellular environments and influence vital cellular processes. In vivo, the extracellular matrix is composed of fibrous arrays. To understand the fibre geometries that are required for adhesion formation, we patterned nanolines of various line widths and arrangements in single, crossing or paired arrays with the integrin-binding peptide Arg-Gly-Asp. Single thin lines (width ≤30 nm) did not support cell spreading or formation of focal adhesions, despite the presence of a high density of Arg-Gly-Asp, but wide lines (>40 nm) did. Using super-resolution microscopy, we observed stable, dense integrin clusters formed on parallel (within 110 nm) or crossing thin lines (mimicking a matrix mesh) similar to those on continuous substrates. These dense clusters bridged the line pairs by recruiting activated but unliganded integrins, as verified by integrin mutants unable to bind ligands that coclustered with ligand-bound integrins when present in an active extended conformation. Thus, in a fibrous extracellular matrix mesh, stable integrin nanoclusters bridge between thin (≤30 nm) matrix fibres and bring about downstream consequences of cell motility and growth."
381,Actomyosin controls planarity and folding of epithelia in response to compression,2019-08-26,"Throughout embryonic development and adult life, epithelia are subjected to compressive deformations. While these have been shown to trigger mechanosensitive responses such as cell extrusion and differentiation, which span tens of minutes, little is known about how epithelia adapt to compression over shorter timescales. Here, using suspended epithelia, we uncover the immediate response of epithelial tissues to the application of in-plane compressive strains (5–80%). We show that fast compression induces tissue buckling followed by actomyosin-dependent tissue flattening that erases the buckle within tens of seconds, in both mono- and multi-layered epithelia. Strikingly, we identify a well-defined limit to this response, so that stable folds form in the tissue when compressive strains exceed a ‘buckling threshold’ of ~35%. A combination of experiment and modelling shows that this behaviour is orchestrated by adaptation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton as it re-establishes tissue tension following compression. Thus, tissue pre-tension allows epithelia to both buffer against deformation and sets their ability to form and retain folds during morphogenesis."
382,Enhanced sieving from exfoliated MoS,2019-08-26,"Nanolaminate membranes made of two-dimensional materials such as graphene oxide are promising candidates for molecular sieving via size-limited diffusion in the two-dimensional capillaries, but high hydrophilicity makes these membranes unstable in water. Here, we report a nanolaminate membrane based on covalently functionalized molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets. The functionalized MoS2 membranes demonstrate >90% and ~87% rejection for micropollutants and NaCl, respectively, when operating under reverse osmotic conditions. The sieving performance and water flux of the functionalized MoS2 membranes are attributed both to control of the capillary widths of the nanolaminates and to control of the surface chemistry of the nanosheets. We identify small hydrophobic functional groups, such as the methyl group, as the most promising for water purification. Methyl- functionalized nanosheets show high water permeation rates as confirmed by our molecular dynamic simulations, while maintaining high NaCl rejection. Control of the surface chemistry and the interlayer spacing therefore offers opportunities to tune the selectivity of the membranes while enhancing their stability."
383,Programming shape using kirigami tessellations,2019-08-19,"Kirigami tessellations, regular planar patterns formed by partially cutting flat, thin sheets, allow compact shapes to morph into open structures with rich geometries and unusual material properties. However, geometric and topological constraints make the design of such structures challenging. Here we pose and solve the inverse problem of determining the number, size and orientation of cuts that enables the deployment of a closed, compact regular kirigami tessellation to conform approximately to any prescribed target shape in two or three dimensions. We first identify the constraints on the lengths and angles of generalized kirigami tessellations that guarantee that their reconfigured face geometries can be contracted from a non-trivial deployed shape to a compact, non-overlapping planar cut pattern. We then encode these conditions into a flexible constrained optimization framework to obtain generalized kirigami patterns derived from various periodic tesselations of the plane that can be deployed into a wide variety of prescribed shapes. A simple mechanical analysis of the resulting structure allows us to determine and control the stability of the deployed state and control the deployment path. Finally, we fabricate physical models that deploy in two and three dimensions to validate this inverse design approach. Altogether, our approach, combining geometry, topology and optimization, highlights the potential for generalized kirigami tessellations as building blocks for shape-morphing mechanical metamaterials."
384,"Hyaluronic acid–bilirubin nanomedicine for targeted modulation of dysregulated intestinal barrier, microbiome and immune responses in colitis",2019-08-19,"While conventional approaches for inflammatory bowel diseases mainly focus on suppressing hyperactive immune responses, it remains unclear how to address disrupted intestinal barriers, dysbiosis of the gut commensal microbiota and dysregulated mucosal immune responses in inflammatory bowel diseases. Moreover, immunosuppressive agents can cause off-target systemic side effects and complications. Here, we report the development of hyaluronic acid–bilirubin nanomedicine (HABN) that accumulates in inflamed colonic epithelium and restores the epithelium barriers in a murine model of acute colitis. Surprisingly, HABN also modulates the gut microbiota, increasing the overall richness and diversity and markedly augmenting the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Clostridium XIVα, which are microorganisms with crucial roles in gut homeostasis. Importantly, HABN associated with pro-inflammatory macrophages, regulated innate immune responses and exerted potent therapeutic efficacy against colitis. Our work sheds light on the impact of nanotherapeutics on gut homeostasis, microbiome and innate immune responses for the treatment of inflammatory diseases."
385,Nanometre-thin indium tin oxide for advanced high-performance electronics,2019-08-12,"Although indium tin oxide (ITO) is widely used in optoelectronics due to its high optical transmittance and electrical conductivity, its degenerate doping limits exploitation as a semiconduction material. In this work, we created short-channel active transistors based on an ultra-thin (down to 4 nm) ITO channel and a high-quality, lanthanum-doped hafnium oxide dielectric of equivalent oxide thickness of 0.8 nm, with performance comparative to that of existing metal oxides and emerging two-dimensional materials. Short-channel immunity, with a subthreshold slope of 66 mV per decade, off-state current <100 fA μm–1 and on/off ratio up to 5.5 × 109, was measured for a 40-nm transistor. Logic inverters working in the subthreshold regime exhibit a high gain of 178 at a low-supply voltage of 0.5 V. Moreover, radiofrequency transistors, with as-measured cut-off frequency fT and maximum oscillation frequency fmax both >10 GHz, have been demonstrated. The unique wide bandgap and low dielectric constant of ITO provide prospects for future scaling below the 5-nm regime for advanced low-power electronics."
386,Self-assembled nanostructures in ionic liquids facilitate charge storage at electrified interfaces,2019-08-12,"Driven by the potential applications of ionic liquids (ILs) in many emerging electrochemical technologies, recent research efforts have been directed at understanding the complex ion ordering in these systems, to uncover novel energy storage mechanisms at IL–electrode interfaces. Here, we discover that surface-active ILs (SAILs), which contain amphiphilic structures inducing self-assembly, exhibit enhanced charge storage performance at electrified surfaces. Unlike conventional non-amphiphilic ILs, for which ion distribution is dominated by Coulombic interactions, SAILs exhibit significant and competing van der Waals interactions owing to the non-polar surfactant tails, leading to unusual interfacial ion distributions. We reveal that, at an intermediate degree of electrode polarization, SAILs display optimum performance, because the low-charge-density alkyl tails are effectively excluded from the electrode surfaces, whereas the formation of non-polar domains along the surface suppresses undesired overscreening effects. This work represents a crucial step towards understanding the unique interfacial behaviour and electrochemical properties of amphiphilic liquid systems showing long-range ordering, and offers insights into the design principles for high-energy-density electrolytes based on spontaneous self-assembly behaviour."
387,Active particles sense micromechanical properties of glasses,2019-08-05,"Understanding the mechanical properties of glasses is a great scientific challenge. A powerful technique to study the material response on a microscopic scale is microrheology, in which one analyses the translational dynamics of an externally driven probe particle. Here we show that the translational and rotational dynamics of a self-propelled probe particle with an unconstrained orientational motion can be used to gather information about the mechanical properties of a colloidal glassy system. We find that its rotational diffusion coefficient continuously increases towards the glass transition and drops down in the glassy state. Such unexpected behaviour demonstrates a strong coupling mechanism between the orientation of the active probe particle and the glassy structure, which can be well described by a simple rheological model. Our results suggest that active probe particles may be useful for the micromechanical characterization of complex materials."
388,Bio-inspired hydrophobicity promotes CO,2019-08-05,"The aqueous electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into alcohol and hydrocarbon fuels presents a sustainable route towards energy-rich chemical feedstocks. Cu is the only material able to catalyse the substantial formation of multicarbon products (C2/C3), but competing proton reduction to hydrogen is an ever-present drain on selectivity. Here, a superhydrophobic surface was generated by 1-octadecanethiol treatment of hierarchically structured Cu dendrites, inspired by the structure of gas-trapping cuticles on subaquatic spiders. The hydrophobic electrode attained a 56% Faradaic efficiency for ethylene and 17% for ethanol production at neutral pH, compared to 9% and 4% on a hydrophilic, wettable equivalent. These observations are assigned to trapped gases at the hydrophobic Cu surface, which increase the concentration of CO2 at the electrode–solution interface and consequently increase CO2 reduction selectivity. Hydrophobicity is thus proposed as a governing factor in CO2 reduction selectivity and can help explain trends seen on previously reported electrocatalysts."
389,Dynamic charge and oxidation state of Pt/CeO,2019-08-05,"The catalytic activity of metals supported on oxides depends on their charge and oxidation state. Yet, the determination of the degree of charge transfer at the interface remains elusive. Here, by combining density functional theory and first-principles molecular dynamics on Pt single atoms deposited on the CeO2 (100) surface, we show that the common representation of a static metal charge is oversimplified. Instead, we identify several well-defined charge states that are dynamically interconnected and thus coexist. The origin of this new class of strong metal–support interactions is the relative position of the Ce(4f) levels with respect to those of the noble metal, allowing electron injection to (or recovery from) the support. This process is phonon-assisted, as the Ce(4f) levels adjust by surface atom displacement, and appears for other metals (Ni) and supports (TiO2). Our dynamic model explains the unique reactivity found for activated single Pt atoms on ceria able to perform CO oxidation, meeting the Department of Energy 150 °C challenge for emissions."
390,Kinetics of electrochemical dissolution of metals in porous media,2019-07-29,"Metals embedded in porous media interact electrochemically with the liquid phase contained in the pores. A widespread form of this, adversely affecting the integrity of engineered structures, is corrosion of steel in porous media or in natural environments. While it is well documented that the rate of this electrochemical dissolution process can vary over several orders of magnitude, understanding the underlying mechanisms remains a critical challenge hampering the development of reliable predictive models. Here we study the electrochemical dissolution kinetics of steel in meso-to-macro-porous media, using cement-based materials, wood and artificial soil as model systems. Our results reveal the dual role of the pore structure (that is, the influence on the electrochemical behaviour through transport limitations and an area effect, which is ultimately due to microscopic inhomogeneity of the metal/porous material interface). We rationalize the observations with the theory of capillary condensation and propose a material-independent model to predict the corrosion rate."
391,Critical stripping current leads to dendrite formation on plating in lithium anode solid electrolyte cells,2019-07-29,"A critical current density on stripping is identified that results in dendrite formation on plating and cell failure. When the stripping current density removes Li from the interface faster than it can be replenished, voids form in the Li at the interface and accumulate on cycling, increasing the local current density at the interface and ultimately leading to dendrite formation on plating, short circuit and cell death. This occurs even when the overall current density is considerably below the threshold for dendrite formation on plating. For the Li/Li6PS5Cl/Li cell, this is 0.2 and 1.0 mA cm−2 at 3 and 7 MPa pressure, respectively, compared with a critical current for plating of 2.0 mA cm−2 at both 3 and 7 MPa. The pressure dependence on stripping indicates that creep rather than Li diffusion is the dominant mechanism transporting Li to the interface. The critical stripping current is a major factor limiting the power density of Li anode solid-state cells. Considerable pressure may be required to achieve even modest power densities in solid-state cells."
392,High stability and luminescence efficiency in donor–acceptor neutral radicals not following the Aufbau principle,2019-07-22,"With their unusual electronic structures, organic radical molecules display luminescence properties potentially relevant to lighting applications; yet, their luminescence quantum yield and stability lag behind those of other organic emitters. Here, we designed donor–acceptor neutral radicals based on an electron-poor perchlorotriphenylmethyl or tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl radical moiety combined with different electron-rich groups. Experimental and quantum-chemical studies demonstrate that the molecules do not follow the Aufbau principle: the singly occupied molecular orbital is found to lie below the highest (doubly) occupied molecular orbital. These donor–acceptor radicals have a strong emission yield (up to 54%) and high photostability, with estimated half-lives reaching up to several months under pulsed ultraviolet laser irradiation. Organic light-emitting diodes based on such a radical emitter show deep-red/near-infrared emission with a maximal external quantum efficiency of 5.3%. Our results provide a simple molecular-design strategy for stable, highly luminescent radicals with non-Aufbau electronic structures."
393,A hybrid material that reversibly switches between two stable solid states,2019-07-22,"Most types of solid matter have a single stable solid state for a particular set of conditions. Nonetheless, materials with distinct, interchangeable solid states would be advantageous for several technological applications. Here, we describe a material composed of a polymer impregnated with a supercooled salt solution, termed as sal-gel, that assumes two distinct but stable and reversible solid states under the same conditions for a range of temperatures (−90 to 58 °C) and pressure. On transient stimulation of nucleation, the material switches from a clear and soft solid to a white and hard state, which can be 104 times stiffer than the original (15 kPa versus 385 MPa). This hard solid becomes soft again by transient heating, demonstrating the reversibility of the transition. This concept, exploiting the robust physical metastability of a liquid state, is extended to sugar alcohols, resulting in a stimuli-responsive and non-evaporating sug-gel. These ‘two-in-one’ solid materials may find potential uses in soft robotics and adhesive applications."
394,Unjamming overcomes kinetic and proliferation arrest in terminally differentiated cells and promotes collective motility of carcinoma,2019-07-22,"During wound repair, branching morphogenesis and carcinoma dissemination, cellular rearrangements are fostered by a solid-to-liquid transition, known as unjamming. The biomolecular machinery behind unjamming and its pathophysiological relevance remain, however, unclear. Here, we study unjamming in a variety of normal and tumorigenic epithelial two-dimensional (2D) and 3D collectives. Biologically, the increased level of the small GTPase RAB5A sparks unjamming by promoting non-clathrin-dependent internalization of epidermal growth factor receptor that leads to hyperactivation of the kinase ERK1/2 and phosphorylation of the actin nucleator WAVE2. This cascade triggers collective motility effects with striking biophysical consequences. Specifically, unjamming in tumour spheroids is accompanied by persistent and coordinated rotations that progressively remodel the extracellular matrix, while simultaneously fluidizing cells at the periphery. This concurrent action results in collective invasion, supporting the concept that the endo-ERK1/2 pathway is a physicochemical switch to initiate collective invasion and dissemination of otherwise jammed carcinoma."
395,Self-gating in semiconductor electrocatalysis,2019-07-22,"The semiconductor–electrolyte interface dominates the behaviours of semiconductor electrocatalysis, which has been modelled as a Schottky-analogue junction according to classical electron transfer theories. However, this model cannot be used to explain the extremely high carrier accumulations in ultrathin semiconductor catalysis observed in our work. Inspired by the recently developed ion-controlled electronics, we revisit the semiconductor–electrolyte interface and unravel a universal self-gating phenomenon through microcell-based in situ electronic/electrochemical measurements to clarify the electronic-conduction modulation of semiconductors during the electrocatalytic reaction. We then demonstrate that the type of semiconductor catalyst strongly correlates with their electrocatalysis; that is, n-type semiconductor catalysts favour cathodic reactions such as the hydrogen evolution reaction, p-type ones prefer anodic reactions such as the oxygen evolution reaction and bipolar ones tend to perform both anodic and cathodic reactions. Our study provides new insight into the electronic origin of the semiconductor–electrolyte interface during electrocatalysis, paving the way for designing high-performance semiconductor catalysts."
396,Spatially dispersive circular photogalvanic effect in a Weyl semimetal,2019-07-15,"Weyl semimetals (WSMs) are gapless topological states of matter with broken inversion and/or time reversal symmetry. WSMs can support a circulating photocurrent when illuminated by circularly polarized light at normal incidence. Here, we report a spatially dispersive circular photogalvanic effect (s-CPGE) in a WSM that occurs with a spatially varying beam profile. Our analysis shows that the s-CPGE is controlled by a symmetry selection rule combined with asymmetric carrier excitation and relaxation dynamics. By evaluating the s-CPGE for a minimal model of a WSM, a frequency-dependent scaling behaviour of the photocurrent is obtained. Wavelength-dependent measurements from the visible to mid-infrared range show evidence of Berry curvature singularities and band inversion in the s-CPGE response. We present the s-CPGE as a promising spectroscopic probe for topological band properties, with the potential for controlling photoresponse by patterning optical fields on topological materials to store, manipulate and transmit information."
397,Predictive model of hydrogen trapping and bubbling in nanovoids in bcc metals,2019-07-15,"The interplay between hydrogen and nanovoids, despite long being recognized as a central factor in hydrogen-induced damage in structural materials, remains poorly understood. Here, focusing on tungsten as a model body-centred cubic system, we explicitly demonstrate sequential adsorption of hydrogen adatoms on Wigner–Seitz squares of nanovoids with distinct energy levels. Interaction between hydrogen adatoms on nanovoid surfaces is shown to be dominated by pairwise power-law repulsion. We establish a predictive model for quantitative determination of the configurations and energetics of hydrogen adatoms in nanovoids. This model, combined with the equation of states of hydrogen gas, enables the prediction of hydrogen molecule formation in nanovoids. Multiscale simulations, performed based on our model, show good agreement with recent thermal desorption experiments. This work clarifies fundamental physics and provides a full-scale predictive model for hydrogen trapping and bubbling in nanovoids, offering long-sought mechanistic insights that are crucial for understanding hydrogen-induced damage in structural materials."
398,Intermediate-sized molecular sieving of styrene from larger and smaller analogues,2019-07-15,"Molecular sieving can lead to ultrahigh selectivity and low regeneration energy because it completely excludes all larger molecules via a size restriction mechanism. However, it allows adsorption of all molecules smaller than the pore aperture and so separations of complicated mixtures can be hindered. Here, we report an intermediate-sized molecular sieving (iSMS) effect in a metal–organic framework (MAF-41) designed with restricted flexibility, which also exhibits superhydrophobicity and ultrahigh thermal/chemical stabilities. Single-component isotherms and computational simulations show adsorption of styrene but complete exclusion of the larger analogue ethylbenzene (because it exceeds the maximal aperture size) and smaller toluene/benzene molecules that have insufficient adsorption energy to open the cavity. Mixture adsorption experiments show a high styrene selectivity of 1,250 for an ethylbenzene/styrene mixture and 3,300 for an ethylbenzene/styrene/toluene/benzene mixture (orders of magnitude higher than previous reports). This produces styrene with a purity of 99.9%+ in a single adsorption–desorption cycle. Controlling/restricting flexibility is the key for iSMS and can be a promising strategy for discovering other exceptional properties."
399,Quantum jamming transition to a correlated electron glass in 1T-TaS,2019-07-15,"Distinct many-body states may be created under non-equilibrium conditions through different ordering paths, even when their constituents are subjected to the same fundamental interactions. The phase-transition mechanism to such states remains poorly understood. Here, we show that controlled optical or electromagnetic perturbations can lead to an amorphous metastable state of strongly correlated electrons in a quasi-two-dimensional dichalcogenide. Scanning tunnelling microscopy reveals a hyperuniform pattern of localized charges, whereas multitip surface nanoscale conductivity measurements and tunnelling spectroscopy show an electronically gapless conducting state that is different from conventional Coulomb glasses and many-body localized systems. The state is stable up to room temperature and shows no signs of either local charge order or phase separation. The mechanism for its formation is attributed to a dynamical localization of electrons through mutual interactions. Theoretical calculations confirm the correlations between localized charges to be crucial for the state’s unusual stability."
400,Formation of two-dimensional transition metal oxide nanosheets with nanoparticles as intermediates,2019-07-08,"Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted significant interest because of their large surface-to-volume ratios and electron confinement. Compared to common 2D materials such as graphene or metal hydroxides, with their intrinsic layered atomic structures, the formation mechanisms of 2D metal oxides with a rocksalt structure are not well understood. Here, we report the formation process for 2D cobalt oxide and cobalt nickel oxide nanosheets, after analysis by in situ liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy. Our observations reveal that three-dimensional (3D) nanoparticles are initially formed from the molecular precursor solution and then transform into 2D nanosheets. Ab initio calculations show that a small nanocrystal is dominated by positive edge energy, but when it grows to a certain size, the negative surface energy becomes dominant, driving the transformation of the 3D nanocrystal into a 2D structure. Uncovering these growth pathways, including the 3D-to-2D transition, provides opportunities for future material design and synthesis in solution."
401,Scalable in operando strain tuning in nanophotonic waveguides enabling three-quantum-dot superradiance,2019-07-08,"The quest for an integrated quantum optics platform has motivated the field of semiconductor quantum dot research for two decades. Demonstrations of quantum light sources, single photon switches, transistors and spin–photon interfaces have become very advanced. Yet the fundamental problem that every quantum dot is different prevents integration and scaling beyond a few quantum dots. Here, we address this challenge by patterning strain via local phase transitions to selectively tune individual quantum dots that are embedded in a photonic architecture. The patterning is implemented with in operando laser crystallization of a thin HfO2 film ‘sheath’ on the surface of a GaAs waveguide. Using this approach, we tune InAs quantum dot emission energies over the full inhomogeneous distribution with a step size down to the homogeneous linewidth and a spatial resolution better than 1 µm. Using these capabilities, we tune multiple quantum dots into resonance within the same waveguide and demonstrate a quantum interaction via superradiant emission from three quantum dots."
402,Regioselective generation and reactivity control of subnanometric platinum clusters in zeolites for high-temperature catalysis,2019-07-01,"Subnanometric metal species (single atoms and clusters) have been demonstrated to be unique compared with their nanoparticulate counterparts. However, the poor stabilization of subnanometric metal species towards sintering at high temperature (>500 °C) under oxidative or reductive reaction conditions limits their catalytic application. Zeolites can serve as an ideal support to stabilize subnanometric metal catalysts, but it is challenging to localize subnanometric metal species on specific sites and modulate their reactivity. We have achieved a very high preference for localization of highly stable subnanometric Pt and PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite, as revealed by atomically resolved electron microscopy combining high-angle annular dark-field and integrated differential phase contrast imaging techniques. These catalysts show very high stability, selectivity and activity for the industrially important dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene. This stabilization strategy could be extended to other crystalline porous materials."
403,Resorcinol–formaldehyde resins as metal-free semiconductor photocatalysts for solar-to-hydrogen peroxide energy conversion,2019-07-01,"Artificial photosynthesis is a critical challenge in moving towards a sustainable energy future. Photocatalytic generation of hydrogen peroxide from water and dioxygen (H2O + \(\frac{1}{2}\)O2 → H2O2, ΔG° = 117 kJ mol–1) by sunlight is a promising strategy for artificial photosynthesis because H2O2 is a storable and transportable fuel that can be used directly for electricity generation. All previously reported powder photocatalysts, however, have suffered from low efficiency in H2O2 generation. Here we report that resorcinol–formaldehyde resins, widely used inexpensive polymers, act as efficient semiconductor photocatalysts to provide a new basis for H2O2 generation. Simple high-temperature hydrothermal synthesis (~523 K) produces low-bandgap resorcinol–formaldehyde resins comprising π-conjugated and π-stacked benzenoid–quinoid donor–acceptor resorcinol couples. The resins absorb broad-wavelength light up to 700 nm and catalyse water oxidation and O2 reduction by the photogenerated charges. Simulated sunlight irradiation of the resins stably generates H2O2 with more than 0.5% solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency. Therefore, this metal-free system shows significant potential as a new artificial photosynthesis system."
404,High-resolution remote thermometry and thermography using luminescent low-dimensional tin-halide perovskites,2019-07-01,"Although metal-halide perovskites have recently revolutionized research in optoelectronics through a unique combination of performance and synthetic simplicity, their low-dimensional counterparts can further expand the field with hitherto unknown and practically useful optical functionalities. In this context, we present the strong temperature dependence of the photoluminescence lifetime of low-dimensional, perovskite-like tin-halides and apply this property to thermal imaging. The photoluminescence lifetimes are governed by the heat-assisted de-trapping of self-trapped excitons, and their values can be varied over several orders of magnitude by adjusting the temperature (up to 20 ns °C−1). Typically, this sensitive range spans up to 100 °C, and it is both compound-specific and shown to be compositionally and structurally tunable from −100 to 110 °C going from [C(NH2)3]2SnBr4 to Cs4SnBr6 and (C4N2H14I)4SnI6. Finally, through the implementation of cost-effective hardware for fluorescence lifetime imaging, based on time-of-flight technology, these thermoluminophores have been used to record thermographic videos with high spatial and thermal resolution."
405,Long-term implant fibrosis prevention in rodents and non-human primates using crystallized drug formulations,2019-06-24,"Implantable medical devices have revolutionized modern medicine. However, immune-mediated foreign body response (FBR) to the materials of these devices can limit their function or even induce failure. Here we describe long-term controlled-release formulations for local anti-inflammatory release through the development of compact, solvent-free crystals. The compact lattice structure of these crystals allows for very slow, surface dissolution and high drug density. These formulations suppress FBR in both rodents and non-human primates for at least 1.3 years and 6 months, respectively. Formulations inhibited fibrosis across multiple implant sites—subcutaneous, intraperitoneal and intramuscular. In particular, incorporation of GW2580, a colony stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor, into a range of devices, including human islet microencapsulation systems, electrode-based continuous glucose-sensing monitors and muscle-stimulating devices, inhibits fibrosis, thereby allowing for extended function. We believe that local, long-term controlled release with the crystal formulations described here enhances and extends function in a range of medical devices and provides a generalized solution to the local immune response to implanted biomaterials."
406,Shape-encoded dynamic assembly of mobile micromachines,2019-06-24,"Field-directed and self-propelled colloidal assembly have been used to build micromachines capable of performing complex motions and functions. However, integrating heterogeneous components into micromachines with specified structure, dynamics and function is still challenging. Here, we describe the dynamic self-assembly of mobile micromachines with desired configurations through pre-programmed physical interactions between structural and motor units. The assembly is driven by dielectrophoretic interactions, encoded in the three-dimensional shape of the individual parts. Micromachines assembled from magnetic and self-propelled motor parts exhibit reconfigurable locomotion modes and additional rotational degrees of freedom that are not available to conventional monolithic microrobots. The versatility of this site-selective assembly strategy is demonstrated on different reconfigurable, hierarchical and three-dimensional micromachine assemblies. Our results demonstrate how shape-encoded assembly pathways enable programmable, reconfigurable mobile micromachines. We anticipate that the presented design principle will advance and inspire the development of more sophisticated, modular micromachines and their integration into multiscale hierarchical systems."
407,Single crystal texture by directed molecular self-assembly along dual axes,2019-06-17,"Creating well-defined single-crystal textures in materials requires the biaxial alignment of all grains into desired orientations, which is challenging to achieve in soft materials. Here we report the formation of single crystals with rigorously controlled texture over macroscopic areas (>1 cm2) in a soft mesophase of a columnar discotic liquid crystal. We use two modes of directed self-assembly, physical confinement and magnetic fields, to achieve control of the orientations of the columnar axes and the hexagonal lattice along orthogonal directions. Field control of the lattice orientation emerges in a low-temperature phase of tilted discogens that breaks the field degeneracy around the columnar axis present in non-tilted states. Conversely, column orientation is controlled by physical confinement and the resulting imposition of homeotropic anchoring at bounding surfaces. These results extend our understanding of molecular organization in tilted systems and may enable the development of a range of new materials for distinct applications."
408,A map of the inorganic ternary metal nitrides,2019-06-17,"Exploratory synthesis in new chemical spaces is the essence of solid-state chemistry. However, uncharted chemical spaces can be difficult to navigate, especially when materials synthesis is challenging. Nitrides represent one such space, where stringent synthesis constraints have limited the exploration of this important class of functional materials. Here, we employ a suite of computational materials discovery and informatics tools to construct a large stability map of the inorganic ternary metal nitrides. Our map clusters the ternary nitrides into chemical families with distinct stability and metastability, and highlights hundreds of promising new ternary nitride spaces for experimental investigation—from which we experimentally realized seven new Zn- and Mg-based ternary nitrides. By extracting the mixed metallicity, ionicity and covalency of solid-state bonding from the density functional theory (DFT)-computed electron density, we reveal the complex interplay between chemistry, composition and electronic structure in governing large-scale stability trends in ternary nitride materials."
409,Quantitative imaging of electric surface potentials with single-atom sensitivity,2019-06-10,"Because materials consist of positive nuclei and negative electrons, electric potentials are omnipresent at the atomic scale. However, due to the long range of the Coulomb interaction, large-scale structures completely outshine small ones. This makes the isolation and quantification of the electric potentials that originate from nanoscale objects such as atoms or molecules very challenging. Here we report a non-contact scanning probe technique that addresses this challenge. It exploits a quantum dot sensor and the joint electrostatic screening by tip and surface, thus enabling quantitative surface potential imaging across all relevant length scales down to single atoms. We apply the technique to the characterization of a nanostructured surface, thereby extracting workfunction changes and dipole moments for important reference systems. This authenticates the method as a versatile tool to study the building blocks of materials and devices down to the atomic scale."
410,Mixed proton and electron conducting double perovskite anodes for stable and efficient tubular proton ceramic electrolysers,2019-06-03,"Hydrogen production from water electrolysis is a key enabling energy storage technology for the large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable energy sources. Proton ceramic electrolysers (PCEs) can produce dry pressurized hydrogen directly from steam, avoiding major parts of cost-driving downstream separation and compression. However, the development of PCEs has suffered from limited electrical efficiency due to electronic leakage and poor electrode kinetics. Here, we present the first fully operational BaZrO3-based tubular PCE, with 10 cm2 active area and a hydrogen production rate above 15 Nml min−1. The novel steam anode Ba1−xGd0.8La0.2+xCo2O6−δ exhibits mixed p-type electronic and protonic conduction and low activation energy for water splitting, enabling total polarization resistances below 1 Ω cm2 at 600 °C and Faradaic efficiencies close to 100% at high steam pressures. These tubular PCEs are mechanically robust, tolerate high pressures, allow improved process integration and offer scale-up modularity."
411,Formation of aligned periodic patterns during the crystallization of organic semiconductor thin films,2019-06-03,"Self-organizing patterns with micrometre-scale features are promising for the large-area fabrication of photonic devices and scattering layers in optoelectronics. Pattern formation would ideally occur in the active semiconductor to avoid the need for further processing steps. Here, we report an approach to form periodic patterns in single layers of organic semiconductors by a simple annealing process. When heated, a crystallization front propagates across the film, producing a sinusoidal surface structure with wavelengths comparable to that of near-infrared light. These surface features initially form in the amorphous region within a micrometre of the crystal growth front, probably due to competition between crystal growth and surface mass transport. The pattern wavelength can be tuned from 800 nm to 2,400 nm by varying the film thickness and annealing temperature, and millimetre-scale domain sizes are obtained. This phenomenon could be exploited for the self-assembly of microstructured organic optoelectronic devices."
412,Long-range chiral exchange interaction in synthetic antiferromagnets,2019-06-03,"The exchange interaction governs static and dynamic magnetism. This fundamental interaction comes in two flavours—symmetric and antisymmetric. The symmetric interaction leads to ferro- and antiferromagnetism, and the antisymmetric interaction has attracted significant interest owing to its major role in promoting topologically non-trivial spin textures that promise fast, energy-efficient devices. So far, the antisymmetric exchange interaction has been found to be rather short ranged and limited to a single magnetic layer. Here we report a long-range antisymmetric interlayer exchange interaction in perpendicularly magnetized synthetic antiferromagnets with parallel and antiparallel magnetization alignments. Asymmetric hysteresis loops under an in-plane field reveal a unidirectional and chiral nature of this interaction, which results in canted magnetic structures. We explain our results by considering spin–orbit coupling combined with reduced symmetry in multilayers. Our discovery of a long-range chiral interaction provides an additional handle to engineer magnetic structures and could enable three-dimensional topological structures."
413,Traction forces at the cytokinetic ring regulate cell division and polyploidy in the migrating zebrafish epicardium,2019-06-03,"Epithelial repair and regeneration are driven by collective cell migration and division. Both cellular functions involve tightly controlled mechanical events, but how physical forces regulate cell division in migrating epithelia is largely unknown. Here we show that cells dividing in the migrating zebrafish epicardium exert large cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) forces during cytokinesis. These forces point towards the division axis and are exerted through focal adhesions that connect the cytokinetic ring to the underlying ECM. When subjected to high loading rates, these cytokinetic focal adhesions prevent closure of the contractile ring, leading to multi-nucleation through cytokinetic failure. By combining a clutch model with experiments on substrates of different rigidity, ECM composition and ligand density, we show that failed cytokinesis is triggered by adhesion reinforcement downstream of increased myosin density. The mechanical interaction between the cytokinetic ring and the ECM thus provides a mechanism for the regulation of cell division and polyploidy that may have implications in regeneration and cancer."
414,Diffraction imaging of nanocrystalline structures in organic semiconductor molecular thin films,2019-06-03,"The properties of organic solids depend on their structure and morphology, yet direct imaging using conventional electron microscopy methods is hampered by the complex internal structure of these materials and their sensitivity to electron beams. Here, we manage to observe the nanocrystalline structure of two organic molecular thin-film systems using transmission electron microscopy by employing a scanning nanodiffraction method that allows for full access to reciprocal space over the size of a spatially localized probe (~2 nm). The morphologies revealed by this technique vary from grains with pronounced segmentation of the structure—characterized by sharp grain boundaries and overlapping domains—to liquid-crystal structures with crystalline orientations varying smoothly over all possible rotations that contain disclinations representing singularities in the director field. The results show how structure–property relationships can be visualized in organic systems using techniques previously only available for hard materials such as metals and ceramics."
415,Molecular optical imaging probes for early diagnosis of drug-induced acute kidney injury,2019-05-27,"Drug-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) with a high morbidity and mortality is poorly diagnosed in hospitals and deficiently evaluated in drug discovery. Here, we report the development of molecular renal probes (MRPs) with high renal clearance efficiency for in vivo optical imaging of drug-induced AKI. MRPs specifically activate their near-infrared fluorescence or chemiluminescence signals towards the prodromal biomarkers of AKI including the superoxide anion, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase and caspase-3, enabling an example of longitudinal imaging of multiple molecular events in the kidneys of living mice. Importantly, they in situ report the sequential occurrence of oxidative stress, lysosomal damage and cellular apoptosis, which precedes clinical manifestation of AKI (decreased glomerular filtration). Such an active imaging mechanism allows MRPs to non-invasively detect the onset of cisplatin-induced AKI at least 36 h earlier than the existing imaging methods. MRPs can also act as exogenous tracers for optical urinalysis that outperforms typical clinical/preclinical assays, demonstrating their clinical promise for early diagnosis of AKI."
416,Targeted homology-directed repair in blood stem and progenitor cells with CRISPR nanoformulations,2019-05-27,"Ex vivo CRISPR gene editing in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells has opened potential treatment modalities for numerous diseases. The current process uses electroporation, sometimes followed by virus transduction. While this complex manipulation has resulted in high levels of gene editing at some genetic loci, cellular toxicity was observed. We have developed a CRISPR nanoformulation based on colloidal gold nanoparticles with a unique loading design capable of cellular entry without the need for electroporation or viruses. This highly monodispersed nanoformulation avoids lysosomal entrapment and localizes to the nucleus in primary human blood progenitors without toxicity. Nanoformulation-mediated gene editing is efficient and sustained with different CRISPR nucleases at multiple loci of therapeutic interest. The engraftment kinetics of nanoformulation-treated primary cells in humanized mice are better relative to those of non-treated cells, with no differences in differentiation. Here we demonstrate non-toxic delivery of the entire CRISPR payload into primary human blood progenitors."
417,"A mechano-signalling network linking microtubules, myosin IIA filaments and integrin-based adhesions",2019-05-21,"The interrelationship between microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton in mechanoregulation of integrin-mediated adhesions is poorly understood. Here, we show that the effects of microtubules on two major types of cell-matrix adhesion, focal adhesions and podosomes, are mediated by KANK family proteins connecting the adhesion protein talin with microtubule tips. Both total microtubule disruption and microtubule uncoupling from adhesions by manipulations with KANKs trigger a massive assembly of myosin IIA filaments, augmenting focal adhesions and disrupting podosomes. Myosin IIA filaments are indispensable effectors in the microtubule-driven regulation of integrin-mediated adhesions. Myosin IIA filament assembly depends on Rho activation by the RhoGEF GEF-H1, which is trapped by microtubules when they are connected with integrin-mediated adhesions via KANK proteins but released after their disconnection. Thus, microtubule capture by integrin-mediated adhesions modulates the GEF-H1-dependent effect of microtubules on the assembly of myosin IIA filaments. Subsequent actomyosin reorganization then remodels the focal adhesions and podosomes, closing the regulatory loop."
418,Parenchymal and stromal tissue regeneration of tooth organ by pivotal signals reinstated in decellularized matrix,2019-05-21,"Cells are transplanted to regenerate an organs’ parenchyma, but how transplanted parenchymal cells induce stromal regeneration is elusive. Despite the common use of a decellularized matrix, little is known as to the pivotal signals that must be restored for tissue or organ regeneration. We report that Alx3, a developmentally important gene, orchestrated adult parenchymal and stromal regeneration by directly transactivating Wnt3a and vascular endothelial growth factor. In contrast to the modest parenchyma formed by native adult progenitors, Alx3-restored cells in decellularized scaffolds not only produced vascularized stroma that involved vascular endothelial growth factor signalling, but also parenchymal dentin via the Wnt/β–catenin pathway. In an orthotopic large-animal model following parenchyma and stroma ablation, Wnt3a-recruited endogenous cells regenerated neurovascular stroma and differentiated into parenchymal odontoblast-like cells that extended the processes into newly formed dentin with a structure–mechanical equivalency to native dentin. Thus, the Alx3–Wnt3a axis enables postnatal progenitors with a modest innate regenerative capacity to regenerate adult tissues. Depleted signals in the decellularized matrix may be reinstated by a developmentally pivotal gene or corresponding protein."
419,Anisotropic spin fluctuations in detwinned FeSe,2019-05-20,"Superconductivity in FeSe emerges from a nematic phase that breaks four-fold rotational symmetry in the iron plane. This phase may arise from orbital ordering, spin fluctuations or hidden magnetic quadrupolar order. Here we use inelastic neutron scattering on a mosaic of single crystals of FeSe, detwinned by mounting on a BaFe2As2 substrate to demonstrate that spin excitations are most intense at the antiferromagnetic wave vectors QAF = (±1, 0) at low energies E = 6–11 meV in the normal state. This two-fold (C2) anisotropy is reduced at lower energies, 3–5 meV, indicating a gapped four-fold (C4) mode. In the superconducting state, however, the strong nematic anisotropy is again reflected in the spin resonance (E = 3.6 meV) at QAF with incommensurate scattering around 5–6 meV. Our results highlight the extreme electronic anisotropy of the nematic phase of FeSe and are consistent with a highly anisotropic superconducting gap driven by spin fluctuations."
420,Bioactive site-specifically modified proteins for 4D patterning of gel biomaterials,2019-05-20,"Protein-modified biomaterials can be used to modulate cellular function in three dimensions. However, as the dynamic heterogeneous control over complex cell physiology continues to be sought, strategies that permit a reversible and user-defined tethering of fragile proteins to materials remain in great need. Here we introduce a modular and robust semisynthetic approach to reversibly pattern cell-laden hydrogels with site-specifically modified proteins. Exploiting a versatile sortase-mediated transpeptidation, we generate a diverse library of homogeneous, singly functionalized proteins with bioorthogonal reactive handles for biomaterial modification. We demonstrate the photoreversible immobilization of fluorescent proteins, enzymes and growth factors to gels with excellent spatiotemporal resolution while retaining native protein bioactivity. Localized epidermal growth factor presentation enables dynamic regulation over proliferation, intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling and subcellularly resolved receptor endocytosis. Our method broadly permits the modification and patterning of a wide range of proteins, which provides newfound avenues to probe and direct advanced cellular fates in four dimensions."
421,Shear-strain-mediated magnetoelectric effects revealed by imaging,2019-05-20,"Large changes in the magnetization of ferromagnetic films can be electrically driven by non-180° ferroelectric domain switching in underlying substrates, but the shear components of the strains that mediate these magnetoelectric effects have not been considered so far. Here we reveal the presence of these shear strains in a polycrystalline film of Ni on a 0.68Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3–0.32PbTiO3 substrate in the pseudo-cubic (011)pc orientation. Although vibrating sample magnetometry records giant magnetoelectric effects that are consistent with the hitherto expected 90° rotations of a global magnetic easy axis, high-resolution vector maps of magnetization (constructed from photoemission electron microscopy data, with contrast from X-ray magnetic circular dichroism) reveal that the local magnetization typically rotates through smaller angles of 62–84°. This shortfall with respect to 90° is a consequence of the shear strain associated with ferroelectric domain switching. The non-orthogonality represents both a challenge and an opportunity for the development and miniaturization of magnetoelectric devices."
422,Highly stable fullerene-based porous molecular crystals with open metal sites,2019-05-13,"The synthesis of conventional porous crystals involves building a framework using reversible chemical bond formation, which can result in hydrolytic instability. In contrast, porous molecular crystals assemble using only weak intermolecular interactions, which generally do not provide the same environmental stability. Here, we report that the simple co-crystallization of a phthalocyanine derivative and a fullerene (C60 or C70) forms porous molecular crystals with environmental stability towards high temperature and hot aqueous base or acid. Moreover, by using diamond anvil cells and synchrotron single-crystal measurements, stability towards extreme pressure (>4 GPa) is demonstrated, with the stabilizing fullerene held between two phthalocyanines and the hold tightening at high pressure. Access to open metal centres within the porous molecular co-crystal is demonstrated by in situ crystallographic analysis of the chemisorption of pyridine, oxygen and carbon monoxide. This suggests strategies for the formation of highly stable and potentially functional porous materials using only weak van der Waals intermolecular interactions."
423,Gap suppression at a Lifshitz transition in a multi-condensate superconductor,2019-05-13,"In multi-orbital materials, superconductivity can exhibit several coupled condensates. In this context, quantum confinement in two-dimensional superconducting oxide interfaces offers new degrees of freedom to engineer the band structure and selectively control the occupancy of 3d orbitals by electrostatic doping. Here, we use resonant microwave transport to extract the superfluid stiffness of the (110)-oriented LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface in the entire phase diagram. We provide evidence of a transition from single-condensate to two-condensate superconductivity driven by continuous and reversible electrostatic doping, which we relate to the Lifshitz transition between 3d bands based on numerical simulations of the quantum well. We find that the superconducting gap is suppressed while the second band is populated, challenging Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theory. We ascribe this behaviour to the existence of superconducting order parameters with opposite signs in the two condensates due to repulsive coupling. Our findings offer an innovative perspective on the possibility to tune and control multiple-orbital physics in superconducting interfaces."
424,The ground exciton state of formamidinium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals is a singlet dark state,2019-05-13,"Lead halide perovskites have emerged as promising new semiconductor materials for high-efficiency photovoltaics, light-emitting applications and quantum optical technologies. Their luminescence properties are governed by the formation and radiative recombination of bound electron–hole pairs known as excitons, whose bright or dark character of the ground state remains unknown and debated. While symmetry analysis predicts a singlet non-emissive ground exciton topped with a bright exciton triplet, it has been predicted that the Rashba effect may reverse the bright and dark level ordering. Here, we provide the direct spectroscopic signature of the dark exciton emission in the low-temperature photoluminescence of single formamidinium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals under magnetic fields. The dark singlet is located several millielectronvolts below the bright triplet, in fair agreement with an estimation of the long-range electron–hole exchange interaction. Nevertheless, these perovskites display an intense luminescence because of an extremely reduced bright-to-dark phonon-assisted relaxation."
425,Ultrafast generation and control of an electron vortex beam via chiral plasmonic near fields,2019-05-06,"Vortex-carrying matter waves, such as chiral electron beams, are of significant interest in both applied and fundamental science. Continuous-wave electron vortex beams are commonly prepared via passive phase masks imprinting a transverse phase modulation on the electron’s wavefunction. Here, we show that femtosecond chiral plasmonic near fields enable the generation and dynamic control on the ultrafast timescale of an electron vortex beam. The vortex structure of the resulting electron wavepacket is probed in both real and reciprocal space using ultrafast transmission electron microscopy. This method offers a high degree of scalability to small length scales and a highly efficient manipulation of the electron vorticity with attosecond precision. Besides the direct implications in the investigation of nanoscale ultrafast processes in which chirality plays a major role, we further discuss the perspectives of using this technique to shape the wavefunction of charged composite particles, such as protons, and how it can be used to probe their internal structure."
426,Deterministic optical control of room temperature multiferroicity in BiFeO,2019-05-06,"Controlling ferroic orders (ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism and ferroelasticity) by optical methods is a significant challenge due to the large mismatch in energy scales between the order parameter coupling strengths and the incident photons. Here, we demonstrate an approach to manipulate multiple ferroic orders in an epitaxial mixed-phase BiFeO3 thin film at ambient temperature via laser illumination. Phase-field simulations indicate that a light-driven flexoelectric effect allows the targeted formation of ordered domains. We also achieved precise sequential laser writing and erasure of different domain patterns, which demonstrates a deterministic optical control of multiferroicity at room temperature. As ferroic orders directly influence susceptibility and conductivity in complex materials, our results not only shed light on the optical control of multiple functionalities, but also suggest possible developments for optoelectronics and related applications."
427,General rule for the energy of water-induced traps in organic semiconductors,2019-04-22,"Charge carrier traps are generally highly detrimental for the performance of semiconductor devices. Unlike the situation for inorganic semiconductors, detailed knowledge about the characteristics and causes of traps in organic semiconductors is still very limited. Here, we accurately determine hole and electron trap energies for a wide range of organic semiconductors in thin-film form. We find that electron and hole trap energies follow a similar empirical rule and lie ~0.3–0.4 eV above the highest occupied molecular orbital and below the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, respectively. Combining experimental and theoretical methods, the origin of the traps is shown to be a dielectric effect of water penetrating nanovoids in the organic semiconductor thin film. We also propose a solvent-annealing method to remove water-related traps from the materials investigated, irrespective of their energy levels. These findings represent a step towards the realization of trap-free organic semiconductor thin films."
428,Reversible and cooperative photoactivation of single-atom Cu/TiO,2019-04-22,"The reversible and cooperative activation process, which includes electron transfer from surrounding redox mediators, the reversible valence change of cofactors and macroscopic functional/structural change, is one of the most important characteristics of biological enzymes, and has frequently been used in the design of homogeneous catalysts. However, there are virtually no reports on industrially important heterogeneous catalysts with these enzyme-like characteristics. Here, we report on the design and synthesis of highly active TiO2 photocatalysts incorporating site-specific single copper atoms (Cu/TiO2) that exhibit a reversible and cooperative photoactivation process. Our atomic-level design and synthetic strategy provide a platform that facilitates valence control of co-catalyst copper atoms, reversible modulation of the macroscopic optoelectronic properties of TiO2 and enhancement of photocatalytic hydrogen generation activity, extending the boundaries of conventional heterogeneous catalysts."
429,Structural evolution of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts dictates reactivity,2019-04-22,"The use of oxide-supported isolated Pt-group metal atoms as catalytic active sites is of interest due to their unique reactivity and efficient metal utilization. However, relationships between the structure of these active sites, their dynamic response to environments and catalytic functionality have proved difficult to experimentally establish. Here, sinter-resistant catalysts where Pt was deposited uniformly as isolated atoms in well-defined locations on anatase TiO2 nanoparticle supports were used to develop such relationships. Through a combination of in situ atomic-resolution microscopy- and spectroscopy-based characterization supported by first-principles calculations it was demonstrated that isolated Pt species can adopt a range of local coordination environments and oxidation states, which evolve in response to varied environmental conditions. The variation in local coordination showed a strong influence on the chemical reactivity and could be exploited to control the catalytic performance."
430,Site-selective CO disproportionation mediated by localized surface plasmon resonance excited by electron beam,2019-04-15,"Recent reports of hot-electron-induced dissociation of small molecules, such as hydrogen, demonstrate the potential application of plasmonic nanostructures for harvesting light to initiate catalytic reactions. Theories have assumed that plasmonic catalysis is mediated by the energy transfer from nanoparticles to adsorbed molecules during the dephasing of localized surface plasmon (LSP) modes optically excited on plasmonic nanoparticles. However, LSP-induced chemical processes have not been resolved at a sub-nanoparticle scale to identify the active sites responsible for the energy transfer. Here, we exploit the LSP resonance excited by electron beam on gold nanoparticles to drive CO disproportionation at room temperature in an environmental scanning transmission electron microscope. Using in situ electron energy-loss spectroscopy with a combination of density functional theory and electromagnetic boundary element method calculations, we show at the subparticle level that the active sites on gold nanoparticles are where preferred gas adsorption sites and the locations of maximum LSP electric field amplitude (resonance antinodes) superimpose. Our findings provide insight into plasmonic catalysis and will be valuable in designing plasmonic antennas for low-temperature catalytic processes."
431,Multi-scale ordering in highly stretchable polymer semiconducting films,2019-04-15,"Stretchable semiconducting polymers have been developed as a key component to enable skin-like wearable electronics, but their electrical performance must be improved to enable more advanced functionalities. Here, we report a solution processing approach that can achieve multi-scale ordering and alignment of conjugated polymers in stretchable semiconductors to substantially improve their charge carrier mobility. Using solution shearing with a patterned microtrench coating blade, macroscale alignment of conjugated-polymer nanostructures was achieved along the charge transport direction. In conjunction, the nanoscale spatial confinement aligns chain conformation and promotes short-range π–π ordering, substantially reducing the energetic barrier for charge carrier transport. As a result, the mobilities of stretchable conjugated-polymer films have been enhanced up to threefold and maintained under a strain up to 100%. This method may also serve as the basis for large-area manufacturing of stretchable semiconducting films, as demonstrated by the roll-to-roll coating of metre-scale films."
432,Rigid helical-like assemblies from a self-aggregating tripeptide,2019-04-15,"The structural versatility, biocompatibility and dynamic range of the mechanical properties of protein materials have been explored in functional biomaterials for a wide array of biotechnology applications. Typically, such materials are made from self-assembled peptides with a predominant β-sheet structure, a common structural motif in silk and amyloid fibrils. However, collagen, the most abundant protein in mammals, is based on a helical arrangement. Here we show that Pro-Phe-Phe, the most aggregation-prone tripeptide of natural amino acids, assembles into a helical-like sheet that is stabilized by the dry hydrophobic interfaces of Phe residues. This architecture resembles that of the functional PSMα3 amyloid, highlighting the role of dry helical interfaces as a core structural motif in amyloids. Proline replacement by hydroxyproline, a major constituent of collagen, generates minimal helical-like assemblies with enhanced mechanical rigidity. These results establish a framework for designing functional biomaterials based on ultrashort helical protein elements."
433,Metal–polymer hybrid nanomaterials for plasmonic ultrafast hydrogen detection,2019-04-01,"Hydrogen–air mixtures are highly flammable. Hydrogen sensors are therefore of paramount importance for timely leak detection during handling. However, existing solutions do not meet the stringent performance targets set by stakeholders, while deactivation due to poisoning, for example by carbon monoxide, is a widely unsolved problem. Here we present a plasmonic metal–polymer hybrid nanomaterial concept, where the polymer coating reduces the apparent activation energy for hydrogen transport into and out of the plasmonic nanoparticles, while deactivation resistance is provided via a tailored tandem polymer membrane. In concert with an optimized volume-to-surface ratio of the signal transducer uniquely offered by nanoparticles, this enables subsecond sensor response times. Simultaneously, hydrogen sorption hysteresis is suppressed, sensor limit of detection is enhanced, and sensor operation in demanding chemical environments is enabled, without signs of long-term deactivation. In a wider perspective, our work suggests strategies for next-generation optical gas sensors with functionalities optimized by hybrid material engineering."
434,Cellulose ionic conductors with high differential thermal voltage for low-grade heat harvesting,2019-03-25,"Converting low-grade heat into useful electricity requires a technology that is efficient and cost effective. Here, we demonstrate a cellulosic membrane that relies on sub-nanoscale confinement of ions in oxidized and aligned cellulose molecular chains to enhance selective diffusion under a thermal gradient. After infiltrating electrolyte into the cellulosic membrane and applying an axial temperature gradient, the ionic conductor exhibits a thermal gradient ratio (analogous to the Seebeck coefficient in thermoelectrics) of 24 mV K–1—more than twice the highest value reported until now. We attribute the enhanced thermally generated voltage to effective sodium ion insertion into the charged molecular chains of the cellulosic membrane, which consists of type II cellulose, while this process does not occur in natural wood or type I cellulose. With this material, we demonstrate a flexible and biocompatible heat-to-electricity conversion device via nanoscale engineering based on sustainable materials that can enable large-scale manufacture."
435,An integrin α,2019-03-25,"Integrins are membrane receptors that mediate cell adhesion and mechanosensing. The structure–function relationship of integrins remains incompletely understood, despite the extensive studies carried out because of its importance to basic cell biology and translational medicine. Using a fluorescence dual biomembrane force probe, microfluidics and cone-and-plate rheometry, we applied precisely controlled mechanical stimulations to platelets and identified an intermediate state of integrin αIIbβ3 that is characterized by an ectodomain conformation, ligand affinity and bond lifetimes that are all intermediate between the well-known inactive and active states. This intermediate state is induced by ligand engagement of glycoprotein (GP) Ibα via a mechanosignalling pathway and potentiates the outside-in mechanosignalling of αIIbβ3 for further transition to the active state during integrin mechanical affinity maturation. Our work reveals distinct αIIbβ3 state transitions in response to biomechanical and biochemical stimuli, and identifies a role for the αIIbβ3 intermediate state in promoting biomechanical platelet aggregation."
436,Unified picture of anionic redox in Li/Na-ion batteries,2019-03-18,"Anionic redox in Li-rich and Na-rich transition metal oxides (A-rich-TMOs) has emerged as a new paradigm to increase the energy density of rechargeable batteries. Ever since, numerous electrodes delivering extra anionic capacity beyond the theoretical cationic capacity have been reported. Unfortunately, most often the anionic capacity achieved in charge is partly irreversible in discharge. A unified picture of anionic redox in A-rich-TMOs is designed here to identify the electronic origin of this irreversibility and to propose new directions to improve the cycling performance of the electrodes. The electron localization function is introduced as a holistic tool to unambiguously locate the oxygen lone pairs in the structure and follow their participation in the redox activity of A-rich-TMOs. The charge-transfer gap of transition metal oxides is proposed as the pertinent observable to quantify the amount of extra capacity achievable in charge and its reversibility in discharge, irrespective of the material chemical composition. From this generalized approach, we conclude that the reversibility of the anionic capacity is limited to a critical number of O holes per oxygen, hO ≤ 1/3."
437,The Fermi surface geometrical origin of axis-dependent conduction polarity in layered materials,2019-03-18,"Electronic materials generally exhibit a single isotropic majority carrier type, electrons or holes. Some superlattice1,2 and hexagonal3,4,5 materials exhibit opposite conduction polarities along in-plane and cross-plane directions due to multiple electron and hole bands. Here, we uncover a material genus with this behaviour that originates from the Fermi surface geometry of a single band. NaSn2As2, a layered metal, has such a Fermi surface. It displays in-plane electron and cross-plane hole conduction in thermopower and exactly the opposite polarity in the Hall effect. The small Nernst coefficient and magnetoresistance preclude multi-band transport. We label this direction-dependent carrier polarity in single-band systems ‘goniopolarity’. We expect to find goniopolarity and the Fermi surface geometry that produces it in many metals and semiconductors whose electronic structure is at the boundary between two and three dimensions. Goniopolarity may enable future explorations of complex transport phenomena that lead to unprecedented device concepts."
438,Ultrahigh conductivity in Weyl semimetal NbAs nanobelts,2019-03-18,"In two-dimensional (2D) systems, high mobility is typically achieved in low-carrier-density semiconductors and semimetals. Here, we discover that the nanobelts of Weyl semimetal NbAs maintain a high mobility even in the presence of a high sheet carrier density. We develop a growth scheme to synthesize single crystalline NbAs nanobelts with tunable Fermi levels. Owing to a large surface-to-bulk ratio, we argue that a 2D surface state gives rise to the high sheet carrier density, even though the bulk Fermi level is located near the Weyl nodes. A surface sheet conductance up to 5–100 S per □ is realized, exceeding that of conventional 2D electron gases, quasi-2D metal films, and topological insulator surface states. Corroborated by theory, we attribute the origin of the ultrahigh conductance to the disorder-tolerant Fermi arcs. The evidenced low-dissipation property of Fermi arcs has implications for both fundamental study and potential electronic applications."
439,Local nascent protein deposition and remodelling guide mesenchymal stromal cell mechanosensing and fate in three-dimensional hydrogels,2019-03-18,"Hydrogels serve as valuable tools for studying cell–extracellular matrix interactions in three-dimensional environments that recapitulate aspects of native extracellular matrix. However, the impact of early protein deposition on cell behaviour within hydrogels has largely been overlooked. Using a bio-orthogonal labelling technique, we visualized nascent proteins within a day of culture across a range of hydrogels. In two engineered hydrogels of interest in three-dimensional mechanobiology studies—proteolytically degradable covalently crosslinked hyaluronic acid and dynamic viscoelastic hyaluronic acid hydrogels—mesenchymal stromal cell spreading, YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation and osteogenic differentiation were observed with culture. However, inhibition of cellular adhesion to nascent proteins or reduction in nascent protein remodelling reduced mesenchymal stromal cell spreading and nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ, resulting in a shift towards adipogenic differentiation. Our findings emphasize the role of nascent proteins in the cellular perception of engineered materials and have implications for in vitro cell signalling studies and application to tissue repair."
440,Pressure promoted low-temperature melting of metal–organic frameworks,2019-03-18,"Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are microporous materials with huge potential for chemical processes. Structural collapse at high pressure, and transitions to liquid states at high temperature, have recently been observed in the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) family of MOFs. Here, we show that simultaneous high-pressure and high-temperature conditions result in complex behaviour in ZIF-62 and ZIF-4, with distinct high- and low-density amorphous phases occurring over different regions of the pressure–temperature phase diagram. In situ powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and optical microscopy reveal that the stability of the liquid MOF state expands substantially towards lower temperatures at intermediate, industrially achievable pressures and first-principles molecular dynamics show that softening of the framework coordination with pressure makes melting thermodynamically easier. Furthermore, the MOF glass formed by melt quenching the high-temperature liquid possesses permanent, accessible porosity. Our results thus imply a route to the synthesis of functional MOF glasses at low temperatures, avoiding decomposition on heating at ambient pressure."
441,Optical creation of a supercrystal with three-dimensional nanoscale periodicity,2019-03-18,"Stimulation with ultrafast light pulses can realize and manipulate states of matter with emergent structural, electronic and magnetic phenomena. However, these non-equilibrium phases are often transient and the challenge is to stabilize them as persistent states. Here, we show that atomic-scale PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices, counterpoising strain and polarization states in alternate layers, are converted by sub-picosecond optical pulses to a supercrystal phase. This phase persists indefinitely under ambient conditions, has not been created via equilibrium routes, and can be erased by heating. X-ray scattering and microscopy show this unusual phase consists of a coherent three-dimensional structure with polar, strain and charge-ordering periodicities of up to 30 nm. By adjusting only dielectric properties, the phase-field model describes this emergent phase as a photo-induced charge-stabilized supercrystal formed from a two-phase equilibrium state. Our results demonstrate opportunities for light-activated pathways to thermally inaccessible and emergent metastable states."
442,Growth of environmentally stable transition metal selenide films,2019-03-11,"Two-dimensional transition metal selenides (TMSs) possess fascinating physical properties. However, many as-prepared TMSs are environmentally unstable and limited in sample size, which greatly hinder their wide applications in high-performance electrical devices. Here we develop a general two-step vapour deposition method and successfully grow different TMS films with controllable thickness, wafer size and high quality. The superconductivity of the grown NbSe2 film is comparable with sheets exfoliated from bulk materials, and can maintain stability after a variety of harsh treatments, which are ascribed to the absence of oxygen during the whole growth process. Such environmental stability can greatly simplify the fabrication procedure for device applications, and should be of both fundamental and technological significance in developing TMS-based devices."
443,Polymer–inorganic solid–electrolyte interphase for stable lithium metal batteries under lean electrolyte conditions,2019-03-11,"The solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) is pivotal in stabilizing lithium metal anodes for rechargeable batteries. However, the SEI is constantly reforming and consuming electrolyte with cycling. The rational design of a stable SEI is plagued by the failure to control its structure and stability. Here we report a molecular-level SEI design using a reactive polymer composite, which effectively suppresses electrolyte consumption in the formation and maintenance of the SEI. The SEI layer consists of a polymeric lithium salt, lithium fluoride nanoparticles and graphene oxide sheets, as evidenced by cryo-transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and surface-sensitive spectroscopies. This structure is different from that of a conventional electrolyte-derived SEI and has excellent passivation properties, homogeneity and mechanical strength. The use of the polymer–inorganic SEI enables high-efficiency Li deposition and stable cycling of 4 V Li|LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cells under lean electrolyte, limited Li excess and high capacity conditions. The same approach was also applied to design stable SEI layers for sodium and zinc anodes."
444,Colossal mid-infrared bulk photovoltaic effect in a type-I Weyl semimetal,2019-03-04,"Broadband, efficient and fast conversion of light to electricity is crucial for sensing and clean energy. The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) is a second-order nonlinear optical effect that intrinsically converts light into electrical current. Here, we demonstrate a large mid-infrared BPVE in microscopic devices of the Weyl semimetal TaAs. This discovery results from combining recent developments in Weyl semimetals, focused-ion beam fabrication and theoretical works suggesting a connection between BPVE and topology. We also present a detailed symmetry analysis that allows us to separate the shift current response from photothermal effects. The magnitude and wavelength range of the assigned shift current may impact optical detectors, clean energy and topology, and demonstrate the utility of Weyl semimetals for practical applications."
445,Nonlinear photoresponse of type-II Weyl semimetals,2019-03-04,"The experimental manifestation of topological effects in bulk materials is attracting enormous research interest. However, direct experimental evidence of the effective k-space monopole of the Weyl nodes has so far been lacking. Here, signatures of the singular topology of the type-II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 are revealed in the photoresponses, which are related to divergence of the Berry curvature. TaIrTe4 exhibits a large photoresponsivity of 130.2 mA W−1—with 4 μm excitation in an unbiased field-effect transistor at room temperature—arising from the third-order nonlinear optical response, approaching the performance of commercial low-temperature detectors. In addition, the circularly polarized galvanic response is enhanced at 4 μm, possibly due to the same Berry curvature singularity enhancement. Considering the optical selection rule of chiral Weyl cones, this may open the door for studying and controlling the chiral polarization of Weyl fermions with an electric field in addition to the optical helicities."
446,Real-time in situ observations of reaction and transport phenomena during silicate glass corrosion by fluid-cell Raman spectroscopy,2019-02-25,"Borosilicate glass is an important material used in various industries due to its chemical durability, such as for the immobilization of high-level nuclear waste. However, it is susceptible to aqueous corrosion, recognizable by the formation of surface alteration layers (SALs). Here, we report in situ fluid-cell Raman spectroscopic experiments providing real-time insights into reaction and transport processes during the aqueous corrosion of a borosilicate glass. The formation of a several-micrometre-thick water-rich zone between the SAL and the glass, interpreted as an interface solution, is detected, as well as pH gradients at the glass surface and within the SAL. By replacing the solution with a deuterated solution, it is observed that water transport through the SAL is not rate-limiting. The data support an interface-coupled dissolution–reprecipitation process for SAL formation. Fluid-cell Raman spectroscopic experiments open up new avenues for studying solid–water reactions, with the ability to in situ trace specific sub-processes in real time by using stable isotopes."
447,Bioinspired neuron-like electronics,2019-02-25,"As an important application of functional biomaterials, neural probes have contributed substantially to studying the brain. Bioinspired and biomimetic strategies have begun to be applied to the development of neural probes, although these and previous generations of probes have had structural and mechanical dissimilarities from their neuron targets that lead to neuronal loss, neuroinflammatory responses and measurement instabilities. Here, we present a bioinspired design for neural probes—neuron-like electronics (NeuE)—where the key building blocks mimic the subcellular structural features and mechanical properties of neurons. Full three-dimensional mapping of implanted NeuE–brain interfaces highlights the structural indistinguishability and intimate interpenetration of NeuE and neurons. Time-dependent histology and electrophysiology studies further reveal a structurally and functionally stable interface with the neuronal and glial networks shortly following implantation, thus opening opportunities for next-generation brain–machine interfaces. Finally, the NeuE subcellular structural features are shown to facilitate migration of endogenous neural progenitor cells, thus holding promise as an electrically active platform for transplantation-free regenerative medicine."
448,Manipulating exchange bias by spin–orbit torque,2019-02-18,"Exchange bias, a shift in the hysteresis loop of a ferromagnet arising from interfacial exchange coupling between adjacent ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic layers, is an integral part of spintronic devices. Here, we show that spin–orbit torque generated from spin current, a promising approach to switch the ferromagnetic magnetization of next-generation magnetic random access memory, can also be used to manipulate the exchange bias. Applying current pulses to a Pt/Co/IrMn trilayer causes concurrent switching of ferromagnetic magnetization and exchange bias, but with different underlying mechanisms. This implies that the ferromagnetic magnetization and exchange bias can be manipulated independently. Our work demonstrates that spin–orbit torque in ferromagnet/antiferromagnet heterostructures facilitates independent manipulations of distinct magnetic properties, motivating innovative designs for future spintronics devices."
449,Fine tuning the extracellular environment accelerates the derivation of kidney organoids from human pluripotent stem cells,2019-02-18,"The generation of organoids is one of the biggest scientific advances in regenerative medicine. Here, by lengthening the time that human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) were exposed to a three-dimensional microenvironment, and by applying defined renal inductive signals, we generated kidney organoids that transcriptomically matched second-trimester human fetal kidneys. We validated these results using ex vivo and in vitro assays that model renal development. Furthermore, we developed a transplantation method that utilizes the chick chorioallantoic membrane. This approach created a soft in vivo microenvironment that promoted the growth and differentiation of implanted kidney organoids, as well as providing a vascular component. The stiffness of the in ovo chorioallantoic membrane microenvironment was recapitulated in vitro by fabricating compliant hydrogels. These biomaterials promoted the efficient generation of renal vesicles and nephron structures, demonstrating that a soft environment accelerates the differentiation of hPSC-derived kidney organoids."
450,Electric field modulation of magnetic exchange in molecular helices,2019-02-18,"The possibility to operate on magnetic materials through the application of electric rather than magnetic fields—promising faster, more compact and energy efficient circuits—continues to spur the investigation of magnetoelectric effects. Symmetry considerations, in particular the lack of an inversion centre, characterize the magnetoelectric effect. In addition, spin–orbit coupling is generally considered necessary to make a spin system sensitive to a charge distribution. However, a magnetoelectric effect not relying on spin–orbit coupling is appealing for spin-based quantum technologies. Here, we report the detection of a magnetoelectric effect that we attribute to an electric field modulation of the magnetic exchange interaction without atomic displacement. The effect is visible in electron paramagnetic resonance absorption of molecular helices under electric field modulation and confirmed by specific symmetry properties and spectral simulation."
451,Strange metal from a frustration-driven charge order instability,2019-02-11,"Interparticle interactions are self-conflicting rather than cooperative on particular lattices. When such geometrical frustration occurs, charge ordering (CO) can be destabilized into non-trivial charge states such as the recently observed charge glass (CG). A more extreme case is the frustration-induced quantum melting of the CO that has been theoretically proposed. Here, we report d.c. charge transport and noise spectroscopy measurements for a triangular-lattice organic conductor situated close to the CO or CG. Our experiments demonstrate that these materials can host a strange metal with unusual charge dynamics, which we attribute to frustration-induced fluctuations of the CO or CG. Our results also show that the anomalous charge fluctuations can freeze into an insulating state when uniaxial stress is applied, which reduces the geometrical frustration. The present observations suggest the existence of the frustration-induced quantum melting of charges analogous to spin liquids."
452,A high-rate and long-life organic–oxygen battery,2019-02-11,"Alkali metal–oxygen batteries promise high gravimetric energy densities but suffer from low rate capability, poor cycle life and safety hazards associated with metal anodes. Here we describe a safe, high-rate and long-life oxygen battery that exploits a potassium biphenyl complex anode and a dimethylsulfoxide-mediated potassium superoxide cathode. The proposed potassium biphenyl complex–oxygen battery exhibits an unprecedented cycle life (3,000 cycles) with a superior average coulombic efficiency of more than 99.84% at a high current density of 4.0 mA cm−2. We further reduce the redox potential of biphenyl by adding the electron-donating methyl group to the benzene ring, which successfully achieved a redox potential of 0.14 V versus K/K+. This demonstrates the direction and opportunities to further improve the cell voltage and energy density of the alkali-metal organic–oxygen batteries."
453,Gate controlling of quantum interference and direct observation of anti-resonances in single molecule charge transport,2019-02-11,"Quantum interference can profoundly affect charge transport in single molecules, but experiments can usually measure only the conductance at the Fermi energy. Because, in general, the most pronounced features of the quantum interference are not located at the Fermi energy, it is highly desirable to probe charge transport in a broader energy range. Here, by means of electrochemical gating, we measure the conductance and map the transmission functions of single molecules at and around the Fermi energy, and study signatures associated with constructive and destructive interference. With electrochemical gate control, we tune the quantum interference between the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, and directly observe anti-resonance, a distinct feature of destructive interference. By tuning the molecule in and out of anti-resonance, we achieve continuous control of the conductance over two orders of magnitude, demonstrating a different gating mechanism to conventional field-effect transistors."
454,Anti-resonance features of destructive quantum interference in single-molecule thiophene junctions achieved by electrochemical gating,2019-02-11,"Controlling the electrical conductance and in particular the occurrence of quantum interference in single-molecule junctions through gating effects has potential for the realization of high-performance functional molecular devices. In this work we used an electrochemically gated, mechanically controllable break junction technique to tune the electronic behaviour of thiophene-based molecular junctions that show destructive quantum interference features. By varying the voltage applied to the electrochemical gate at room temperature, we reached a conductance minimum that provides direct evidence of charge transport controlled by an anti-resonance arising from destructive quantum interference. Our molecular system enables conductance tuning close to two orders of magnitude within the non-faradaic potential region, which is significantly higher than that achieved with molecules not showing destructive quantum interference. Our experimental results, interpreted using quantum transport theory, demonstrate that electrochemical gating is a promising strategy for obtaining improved in situ control over the electrical performance of interference-based molecular devices."
455,Metal–oxygen decoordination stabilizes anion redox in Li-rich oxides,2019-02-04,"Reversible high-voltage redox chemistry is an essential component of many electrochemical technologies, from (electro)catalysts to lithium-ion batteries. Oxygen-anion redox has garnered intense interest for such applications, particularly lithium-ion batteries, as it offers substantial redox capacity at more than 4 V versus Li/Li+ in a variety of oxide materials. However, oxidation of oxygen is almost universally correlated with irreversible local structural transformations, voltage hysteresis and voltage fade, which currently preclude its widespread use. By comprehensively studying the Li2−xIr1−ySnyO3 model system, which exhibits tunable oxidation state and structural evolution with y upon cycling, we reveal that this structure–redox coupling arises from the local stabilization of short approximately 1.8 Å metal–oxygen π bonds and approximately 1.4 Å O–O dimers during oxygen redox, which occurs in Li2−xIr1−ySnyO3 through ligand-to-metal charge transfer. Crucially, formation of these oxidized oxygen species necessitates the decoordination of oxygen to a single covalent bonding partner through formation of vacancies at neighbouring cation sites, driving cation disorder. These insights establish a point-defect explanation for why anion redox often occurs alongside local structural disordering and voltage hysteresis during cycling. Our findings offer an explanation for the unique electrochemical properties of lithium-rich layered oxides, with implications generally for the design of materials employing oxygen redox chemistry."
456,Molecular parameters responsible for thermally activated transport in doped organic semiconductors,2019-01-28,"Doped organic semiconductors typically exhibit a thermal activation of their electrical conductivity, whose physical origin is still under scientific debate. In this study, we disclose relationships between molecular parameters and the thermal activation energy (EA) of the conductivity, revealing that charge transport is controlled by the properties of host–dopant integer charge transfer complexes (ICTCs) in efficiently doped organic semiconductors. At low doping concentrations, charge transport is limited by the Coulomb binding energy of ICTCs, which can be minimized by systematic modification of the charge distribution on the individual ions. The investigation of a wide variety of material systems reveals that static energetic disorder induced by ICTC dipole moments sets a general lower limit for EA at large doping concentrations. The impact of disorder can be reduced by adjusting the ICTC density and the intramolecular relaxation energy of host ions, allowing an increase of conductivity by many orders of magnitude."
457,Three-dimensional printing of piezoelectric materials with designed anisotropy and directional response,2019-01-21,"Piezoelectric coefficients are constrained by the intrinsic crystal structure of the constituent material. Here we describe design and manufacturing routes to previously inaccessible classes of piezoelectric materials that have arbitrary piezoelectric coefficient tensors. Our scheme is based on the manipulation of electric displacement maps from families of structural cell patterns. We implement our designs by additively manufacturing free-form, perovskite-based piezoelectric nanocomposites with complex three-dimensional architectures. The resulting voltage response of the activated piezoelectric metamaterials at a given mode can be selectively suppressed, reversed or enhanced with applied stress. Additionally, these electromechanical metamaterials achieve high specific piezoelectric constants and tailorable flexibility using only a fraction of their parent materials. This strategy may be applied to create the next generation of intelligent infrastructure, able to perform a variety of structural and functional tasks, including simultaneous impact absorption and monitoring, three-dimensional pressure mapping and directionality detection."
458,Chiral crystal-like droplets displaying unidirectional rotational sliding,2019-01-21,"The self-assembly of organic molecules into supramolecular materials with structural ordering beyond the nanometre scale is challenging. Here, we report the spontaneous self-assembly of a chiral discotic triphenylene derivative into millimetre-sized droplets. The structure of the droplets is characterized by high positional and orientational ordering and a three-dimensional integrity similar to that of single crystals. Notwithstanding, these assemblies slide when placed on a vertical substrate demonstrating their fluid nature. X-ray imaging shows that during the sliding process the internal crystal-like structure is maintained and that the droplets undergo clockwise or counterclockwise unidirectional rotation, depending on the chirality of their molecular components. Rheological measurements suggest that this rotational behaviour might result from the distinct yield stress between the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers. Overall, our findings demonstrate that molecular chirality can determine the movement direction of a supramolecular structure, thus expanding the fundamental understanding of the structure and dynamics of soft materials."
459,Sterile particle-induced inflammation is mediated by macrophages releasing IL-33 through a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway,2019-01-21,"Initiation of the innate sterile inflammatory response that can develop in response to microparticle exposure is little understood. Here, we report that a potent type 2 immune response associated with the accumulation of neutrophils, eosinophils and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages was observed in response to sterile microparticles similar in size to wear debris associated with prosthetic implants. Although elevations in interleukin-33 (IL-33) and type 2 cytokines occurred independently of caspase-1 inflammasome signalling, the response was dependent on Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). IL-33 was produced by macrophages and BTK-dependent expression of IL-33 by macrophages was sufficient to initiate the type 2 response. Analysis of inflammation in patient periprosthetic tissue also revealed type 2 responses under aseptic conditions in patients undergoing revision surgery. These findings indicate that microparticle-induced sterile inflammation is initiated by macrophages activated to produce IL-33. They further suggest that both BTK and IL-33 may provide therapeutic targets for wear debris-induced periprosthetic inflammation."
460,Antigens reversibly conjugated to a polymeric glyco-adjuvant induce protective humoral and cellular immunity,2019-01-14,"Fully effective vaccines for complex infections must elicit a diverse repertoire of antibodies (humoral immunity) and CD8+ T-cell responses (cellular immunity). Here, we present a synthetic glyco-adjuvant named p(Man–TLR7), which, when conjugated to antigens, elicits robust humoral and cellular immunity. p(Man–TLR7) is a random copolymer composed of monomers that either target dendritic cells (DCs) via mannose-binding receptors or activate DCs via Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7). Protein antigens are conjugated to p(Man–TLR7) via a self-immolative linkage that releases chemically unmodified antigen after endocytosis, thus amplifying antigen presentation to T cells. Studies with ovalbumin (OVA)–p(Man–TLR7) conjugates demonstrate that OVA–p(Man–TLR7) generates greater humoral and cellular immunity than OVA conjugated to polymers lacking either mannose targeting or TLR7 ligand. We show significant enhancement of Plasmodium falciparum-derived circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-specific T-cell responses, expansion in the breadth of the αCSP IgG response and increased inhibition of sporozoite invasion into hepatocytes with CSP–p(Man–TLR7) when compared with CSP formulated with MPLA/QS-21-loaded liposomes—the adjuvant used in the most clinically advanced malaria vaccine. We conclude that our antigen–p(Man–TLR7) platform offers a strategy to enhance the immunogenicity of protein subunit vaccines."
461,Double doping of conjugated polymers with monomer molecular dopants,2019-01-14,"Molecular doping is a crucial tool for controlling the charge-carrier concentration in organic semiconductors. Each dopant molecule is commonly thought to give rise to only one polaron, leading to a maximum of one donor:acceptor charge-transfer complex and hence an ionization efficiency of 100%. However, this theoretical limit is rarely achieved because of incomplete charge transfer and the presence of unreacted dopant. Here, we establish that common p-dopants can in fact accept two electrons per molecule from conjugated polymers with a low ionization energy. Each dopant molecule participates in two charge-transfer events, leading to the formation of dopant dianions and an ionization efficiency of up to 200%. Furthermore, we show that the resulting integer charge-transfer complex can dissociate with an efficiency of up to 170%. The concept of double doping introduced here may allow the dopant fraction required to optimize charge conduction to be halved."
462,Phonon coherences reveal the polaronic character of excitons in two-dimensional lead halide perovskites,2019-01-14,"Hybrid organic–inorganic semiconductors feature complex lattice dynamics due to the ionic character of the crystal and the softness arising from non-covalent bonds between molecular moieties and the inorganic network. Here we establish that such dynamic structural complexity in a prototypical two-dimensional lead iodide perovskite gives rise to the coexistence of diverse excitonic resonances, each with a distinct degree of polaronic character. By means of high-resolution resonant impulsive stimulated Raman spectroscopy, we identify vibrational wavepacket dynamics that evolve along different configurational coordinates for distinct excitons and photocarriers. Employing density functional theory calculations, we assign the observed coherent vibrational modes to various low-frequency (≲50 cm−1) optical phonons involving motion in the lead iodide layers. We thus conclude that different excitons induce specific lattice reorganizations, which are signatures of polaronic binding. This insight into the energetic/configurational landscape involving globally neutral primary photoexcitations may be relevant to a broader class of emerging hybrid semiconductor materials."
463,Addressing the isomer cataloguing problem for nanopores in two-dimensional materials,2019-01-14,"The presence of extended defects or nanopores in two-dimensional (2D) materials can change the electronic, magnetic and barrier membrane properties of the materials. However, the large number of possible lattice isomers of nanopores makes their quantitative study a seemingly intractable problem, confounding the interpretation of experimental and simulated data. Here we formulate a solution to this isomer cataloguing problem (ICP), combining electronic-structure calculations, kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, and chemical graph theory, to generate a catalogue of unique, most-probable isomers of 2D lattice nanopores. The results demonstrate remarkable agreement with precise nanopore shapes observed experimentally in graphene and show that the thermodynamic stability of a nanopore is distinct from its kinetic stability. Triangular nanopores prevalent in hexagonal boron nitride are also predicted, extending this approach to other 2D lattices. The proposed method should accelerate the application of nanoporous 2D materials by establishing specific links between experiment and theory/simulations, and by providing a much-needed connection between molecular design and fabrication."
464,Asymmetrically strained quantum dots with non-fluctuating single-dot emission spectra and subthermal room-temperature linewidths,2019-01-07,"The application of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots as single-dot light sources still requires several challenges to be overcome. Recently, there has been considerable progress in suppressing intensity fluctuations (blinking) by encapsulating an emitting core in a thick protective shell. However, these nanostructures still show considerable fluctuations in both emission energy and linewidth. Here we demonstrate type-I core/shell heterostructures that overcome these deficiencies. They are made by combining wurtzite semiconductors with a large, directionally anisotropic lattice mismatch, which results in strong asymmetric compression of the emitting core. This modifies the structure of band-edge excitonic states and leads to accelerated radiative decay, reduced exciton–phonon interactions, and suppressed coupling to the fluctuating electrostatic environment. As a result, individual asymmetrically strained dots exhibit highly stable emission energy (<1 meV standard deviation) and a subthermal room-temperature linewidth (~20 meV), concurrent with nearly nonblinking behaviour, high emission quantum yields, and a widely tunable emission colour."
465,High-resolution mapping of infraslow cortical brain activity enabled by graphene microtransistors,2018-12-31,"Recording infraslow brain signals (<0.1 Hz) with microelectrodes is severely hampered by current microelectrode materials, primarily due to limitations resulting from voltage drift and high electrode impedance. Hence, most recording systems include high-pass filters that solve saturation issues but come hand in hand with loss of physiological and pathological information. In this work, we use flexible epicortical and intracortical arrays of graphene solution-gated field-effect transistors (gSGFETs) to map cortical spreading depression in rats and demonstrate that gSGFETs are able to record, with high fidelity, infraslow signals together with signals in the typical local field potential bandwidth. The wide recording bandwidth results from the direct field-effect coupling of the active transistor, in contrast to standard passive electrodes, as well as from the electrochemical inertness of graphene. Taking advantage of such functionality, we envision broad applications of gSGFET technology for monitoring infraslow brain activity both in research and in the clinic."
466,Observation of higher-order topological acoustic states protected by generalized chiral symmetry,2018-12-31,"Topological systems are inherently robust to disorder and continuous perturbations, resulting in dissipation-free edge transport of electrons in quantum solids, or reflectionless guiding of photons and phonons in classical wave systems characterized by topological invariants. Recently, a new class of topological materials characterized by bulk polarization has been introduced, and was shown to host higher-order topological corner states. Here, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that 3D-printed two-dimensional acoustic meta-structures can possess nontrivial bulk topological polarization and host one-dimensional edge and Wannier-type second-order zero-dimensional corner states with unique acoustic properties. We observe second-order topological states protected by a generalized chiral symmetry of the meta-structure, which are localized at the corners and are pinned to ‘zero energy’. Interestingly, unlike the ‘zero energy’ states protected by conventional chiral symmetry, the generalized chiral symmetry of our three-atom sublattice enables their spectral overlap with the continuum of bulk states without leakage. Our findings offer possibilities for advanced control of the propagation and manipulation of sound, including within the radiative continuum."
467,Multiferroic quantum criticality,2018-12-31,"The zero-temperature limit of a continuous phase transition is marked by a quantum critical point, which can generate physical effects that extend to elevated temperatures. Magnetic quantum criticality is now well established, and has been explored in systems ranging from heavy fermion metals to quantum Ising materials. Ferroelectric quantum critical behaviour has also been recently demonstrated, motivating a flurry of research investigating its consequences. Here, we introduce the concept of multiferroic quantum criticality, in which both magnetic and ferroelectric quantum criticality occur in the same system. We develop the phenomenology of multiferroic quantum criticality and describe the associated experimental signatures, such as phase stability and modified scaling relations of observables. We propose several material systems that could be tuned to multiferroic quantum criticality utilizing alloying and strain as control parameters. We hope that these results stimulate exploration of the interplay between different kinds of quantum critical behaviours."
468,Dislocation-induced thermal transport anisotropy in single-crystal group-III nitride films,2018-12-17,"Dislocations, one-dimensional lattice imperfections, are common to technologically important materials such as III–V semiconductors, and adversely affect heat dissipation in, for example, nitride-based high-power electronic devices. For decades, conventional nonlinear elasticity models have predicted that this thermal resistance is only appreciable when the heat flux is perpendicular to the dislocations. However, this dislocation-induced anisotropic thermal transport has yet to be seen experimentally. Using time-domain thermoreflectance, we measure strong thermal transport anisotropy governed by highly oriented threading dislocation arrays throughout micrometre-thick, single-crystal indium nitride films. We find that the cross-plane thermal conductivity is almost tenfold higher than the in-plane thermal conductivity at 80 K when the dislocation density is ~3 × 1010 cm−2. This large anisotropy is not predicted by conventional models. With enhanced understanding of dislocation–phonon interactions, our results may allow the tailoring of anisotropic thermal transport with line defects, and could facilitate methods for directed heat dissipation in the thermal management of diverse device applications."
469,Ionic modulation and ionic coupling effects in MoS,2018-12-17,"Coupled ionic–electronic effects present intriguing opportunities for device and circuit development. In particular, layered two-dimensional materials such as MoS2 offer highly anisotropic ionic transport properties, facilitating controlled ion migration and efficient ionic coupling among devices. Here, we report reversible modulation of MoS2 films that is consistent with local 2H–1T′ phase transitions by controlling the migration of Li+ ions with an electric field, where an increase/decrease in the local Li+ ion concentration leads to the transition between the 2H (semiconductor) and 1T′ (metal) phases. The resulting devices show excellent memristive behaviour and can be directly coupled with each other through local ionic exchange, naturally leading to synaptic competition and synaptic cooperation effects observed in biology. These results demonstrate the potential of direct modulation of two-dimensional materials through field-driven ionic processes, and can lead to future electronic and energy devices based on coupled ionic–electronic effects and biorealistic implementation of artificial neural networks."
470,Double-lattice photonic-crystal resonators enabling high-brightness semiconductor lasers with symmetric narrow-divergence beams,2018-12-17,"Achieving high brightness (where brightness is defined as optical power per unit area per unit solid angle) in semiconductor lasers is important for various applications, including direct-laser processing and light detection and ranging for next-generation smart production and mobility. Although the brightness of semiconductor lasers has been increased by the use of edge-emitting-type resonators, their brightness is still one order of magnitude smaller than that of gas and solid-state/fibre lasers, and they often suffer from large beam divergence with strong asymmetry and astigmatism. Here, we develop a so-called ‘double-lattice photonic crystal’, where we superimpose two photonic lattice groups separated by one-quarter wavelength in the x and y directions. Using this resonator, an output power of 10 W with a very narrow-divergence-angle (<0.3°) symmetric surface-emitted beam is achieved from a circular emission area of 500 μm diameter under pulsed conditions, which corresponds to a brightness of over 300 MW cm−2 sr−1. In addition, an output power up to ~7 W is obtained under continuous-wave conditions. Detailed analyses on the double-lattice structure indicate that the resonators have the potential to realize a brightness of up to 10 GW cm−2 sr−1, suggesting that compact, affordable semiconductor lasers will be able to rival existing gas and fibre/disk lasers."
471,Shape-based separation of synthetic microparticles,2018-12-10,"The functional properties of colloidal materials can be tailored by tuning the shape of their constituent particles. Unfortunately, a reliable, general methodology for purifying colloidal materials solely based on shape is still lacking. Here we exploit the single-particle analysis and sorting capabilities of the fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) instrument, a commonly used tool in biomedical research, and demonstrate the ability to separate mixtures of synthetic microparticles based solely on their shape with high purity. We achieve this by simultaneously obtaining four independent optical scattering signals from the FACS instrument to create shape-specific ‘scattering signatures’ that can be used for particle classification and sorting. We demonstrate that these four-dimensional signatures can overcome the confounding effects of particle orientation on shape-based characterization. Using this strategy, robust discrimination of particles differing only slightly in shape and an efficient selection of desired shapes from mixtures comprising particles of diverse sizes and materials is demonstrated."
472,Electric-field induced structural transition in vertical MoTe,2018-12-10,"Transition metal dichalcogenides have attracted attention as potential building blocks for various electronic applications due to their atomically thin nature and polymorphism. Here, we report an electric-field-induced structural transition from a 2H semiconducting to a distorted transient structure (2Hd) and orthorhombic Td conducting phase in vertical 2H-MoTe2- and Mo1−xWxTe2-based resistive random access memory (RRAM) devices. RRAM programming voltages are tunable by the transition metal dichalcogenide thickness and show a distinctive trend of requiring lower electric fields for Mo1−xWxTe2 alloys versus MoTe2 compounds. Devices showed reproducible resistive switching within 10 ns between a high resistive state and a low resistive state. Moreover, using an Al2O3/MoTe2 stack, On/off current ratios of 106 with programming currents lower than 1 μA were achieved in a selectorless RRAM architecture. The sum of these findings demonstrates that controlled electrical state switching in two-dimensional materials is achievable and highlights the potential of transition metal dichalcogenides for memory applications."
473,Revealing molecular-level surface redox sites of controllably oxidized black phosphorus nanosheets,2018-12-10,"Bulk and two-dimensional black phosphorus are considered to be promising battery materials due to their high theoretical capacities of 2,600 mAh g−1. However, their rate and cycling capabilities are limited by the intrinsic (de-)alloying mechanism. Here, we demonstrate a unique surface redox molecular-level mechanism of P sites on oxidized black phosphorus nanosheets that are strongly coupled with graphene via strong interlayer bonding. These redox-active sites of the oxidized black phosphorus are confined at the amorphorized heterointerface, revealing truly reversible pseudocapacitance (99% of total stored charge at 2,000 mV s−1). Moreover, oxidized black-phosphorus-based electrodes exhibit a capacitance of 478 F g–1 (four times greater than black phosphorus) with a rate capability of ~72% (compared to 21.2% for black phosphorus) and retention of ~91% over 50,000 cycles. In situ spectroelectrochemical and theoretical analyses reveal a reversible change in the surface electronic structure and chemical environment of the surface-exposed P redox sites."
474,Long spin coherence length and bulk-like spin–orbit torque in ferrimagnetic multilayers,2018-12-03,"Spintronics relies on magnetization switching through current-induced spin torques. However, because spin transfer torque for ferromagnets is a surface torque, a large switching current is required for a thick, thermally stable ferromagnetic cell, and this remains a fundamental obstacle for high-density non-volatile applications with ferromagnets. Here, we report a long spin coherence length and associated bulk-like torque characteristics in an antiferromagnetically coupled ferrimagnetic multilayer. We find that a transverse spin current can pass through >10-nm-thick ferrimagnetic Co/Tb multilayers, whereas it is entirely absorbed by a 1-nm-thick ferromagnetic Co/Ni multilayer. We also find that the switching efficiency of Co/Tb multilayers partially reflects a bulk-like torque characteristic, as it increases with ferrimagnet thickness up to 8 nm and then decreases, in clear contrast to the 1/thickness dependence of ferromagnetic Co/Ni multilayers. Our results on antiferromagnetically coupled systems will invigorate research towards the development of energy-efficient spintronics."
475,Regioselective surface encoding of nanoparticles for programmable self-assembly,2018-12-03,"Surface encoding of colloidal nanoparticles with DNA is fundamental for fields where recognition interaction is required, particularly controllable material self-assembly. However, regioselective surface encoding of nanoparticles is still challenging because of the difficulty associated with breaking the identical chemical environment on nanoparticle surfaces. Here we demonstrate the selective blocking of nanoparticle surfaces with a diblock copolymer (polystyrene-b-polyacrylic acid). By tuning the interfacial free energies of a ternary system involving the nanoparticles, solvent and copolymer, controllable accessibilities to the nanoparticles’ surfaces are obtained. Through the modification of the polymer-free surface region with single-stranded DNA, regioselective and programmable surface encoding is realized. The resultant interparticle binding potential is selective and directional, allowing for an increased degree of complexity of potential self-assemblies. The versatility of this regioselective surface encoding strategy is demonstrated on various nanoparticles of isotropic or anisotropic shape and a total of 24 distinct complex nanoassemblies are fabricated."
476,Thermal meta-device in analogue of zero-index photonics,2018-12-03,"Inspired by the developments in photonic metamaterials, the concept of thermal metamaterials has promised new avenues for manipulating the flow of heat. In photonics, the existence of natural materials with both positive and negative permittivities has enabled the creation of metamaterials with a very wide range of effective parameters. In contrast, in conductive heat transfer, the available range of thermal conductivities in natural materials is far narrower, strongly restricting the effective parameters of thermal metamaterials and limiting possible applications in extreme environments. Here, we identify a rigorous correspondence between zero index in Maxwell’s equations and infinite thermal conductivity in Fourier’s law. We also propose a conductive system with an integrated convective element that creates an extreme effective thermal conductivity, and hence by correspondence a thermal analogue of photonic near-zero-index metamaterials, a class of metamaterials with crucial importance in controlling light. Synergizing the general properties of zero-index metamaterials and the specific diffusive nature of thermal conduction, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate a thermal zero-index cloak. In contrast with conventional thermal cloaks, this meta-device can operate in a highly conductive background and the cloaked object preserves great sensitivity to external temperature changes. Our work demonstrates a thermal metamaterial which greatly enhances the capability for molding the flow of heat."
477,Real-time insight into the doping mechanism of redox-active organic radical polymers,2018-11-26,"Organic radical polymers for batteries represent some of the fastest-charging redox active materials available. Electron transport and charge storage must be accompanied by ion transport and doping for charge neutrality, but the nature of this process in organic radical polymers is not well understood. This is difficult to intuitively predict because the pendant radical group distinguishes organic radical polymers from conjugated, charged or polar polymers. Here we show for the first time a quantitative view of in situ ion transport and doping in organic radical polymers during the redox process. Two modes dominate: doping by lithium ion expulsion and doping by anion uptake. The dominance of one mode over the other is controlled by anion type, electrolyte concentration and timescale. These results apply in any scenario in which electrolyte is in contact with a non-conjugated redox active polymer and present a means of quantifying doping effects."
478,Highly mechanosensitive ion channels from graphene-embedded crown ethers,2018-11-26,"The ability to tune ionic permeation across nanoscale pores profoundly impacts diverse fields from nanofluidic computing to drug delivery. Here, we take advantage of complex formation between crown ethers and dissolved metal ions to demonstrate graphene-based ion channels highly sensitive to externally applied lattice strain. We perform extensive room-temperature molecular dynamics simulations of the effects of tensile lattice strain on ion permeation across graphene-embedded crown ether pores. Our findings suggest the first instance of solid-state ion channels with an exponential permeation sensitivity to strain, yielding an order of magnitude ion current increase for 2% of isotropic lattice strain. Significant permeation tuning is also shown to be achievable with anisotropic strains. Finally, we demonstrate strain-controllable ion sieving in salt mixtures. The observed high mechanosensitivity is shown to arise from strain-induced control over the competition between ion–crown and ion–solvent interactions, mediated by the atomic thinness of graphene."
479,Flexible layer-structured Bi,2018-11-19,"Inorganic chalcogenides are traditional high-performance thermoelectric materials. However, they suffer from intrinsic brittleness and it is very difficult to obtain materials with both high thermoelectric ability and good flexibility. Here, we report a flexible thermoelectric material comprising highly ordered Bi2Te3 nanocrystals anchored on a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) network, where a crystallographic relationship exists between the Bi2Te3 <\(\bar{1}2\bar{1}0\)> orientation and SWCNT bundle axis. This material has a power factor of ~1,600 μW m−1 K−2 at room temperature, decreasing to 1,100 μW m−1 K−2 at 473 K. With a low in-plane lattice thermal conductivity of 0.26 ± 0.03 W m−1 K−1, a maximum thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 0.89 at room temperature is achieved, originating from a strong phonon scattering effect. The origin of the excellent flexibility and thermoelectric performance of the Bi2Te3–SWCNT material is attributed, by experimental and computational evidence, to its crystal orientation, interface and nanopore structure. Our results provide insight into the design and fabrication of high-performance flexible thermoelectric materials."
480,Metal-induced ordered microporous polymers for fabricating large-area gas separation membranes,2018-11-19,"Metal-induced ordered microporous polymers (MMPs), a class of porous polymer, are synthesized from amine-bearing polymers, small organic linkers and divalent metal ions using a polymer-directed chemical synthesis process. Specifically, small organic linkers first coordinate to metal ions, with the resulting unit cells then self-assembling along the extension of polymer chains to construct three-dimensional frameworks. The MMPs demonstrate good controllability of crystal and framework size, as well as hydrolytic stability. MMP dispersions were coated on a modified polysulfone substrate to fabricate MMP/mPSf membranes with an ultrathin selective layer (below 50 nm) and surface areas of >100 cm2. The MMPs are readily fabricated into defect-free thin selective-layered membranes with high CO2 permeance (3,000 GPU) and stable CO2/N2 selectivity (78) under both humid and dry gas feed conditions, demonstrating promising CO2 membrane separation performance. This synthetic methodology could be extended to other polymers, potentially enabling facile synthesis of membrane materials."
481,Large Pockels effect in micro- and nanostructured barium titanate integrated on silicon,2018-11-12,"The electro-optical Pockels effect is an essential nonlinear effect used in many applications. The ultrafast modulation of the refractive index is, for example, crucial to optical modulators in photonic circuits. Silicon has emerged as a platform for integrating such compact circuits, but a strong Pockels effect is not available on silicon platforms. Here, we demonstrate a large electro-optical response in silicon photonic devices using barium titanate. We verify the Pockels effect to be the physical origin of the response, with r42 = 923 pm V−1, by confirming key signatures of the Pockels effect in ferroelectrics: the electro-optic response exhibits a crystalline anisotropy, remains strong at high frequencies, and shows hysteresis on changing the electric field. We prove that the Pockels effect remains strong even in nanoscale devices, and show as a practical example data modulation up to 50 Gbit s−1. We foresee that our work will enable novel device concepts with an application area largely extending beyond communication technologies."
482,Diffusion-defining atomic-scale spinodal decomposition within nanoprecipitates,2018-11-12,"Stoichiometric precipitates owe their fixed composition to an ordered crystal structure. Deviations from that nominal value, however, are encountered at times. Here we investigate composition, structure and diffusion phenomena of ordered precipitates that form during heat treatment in an industrially cast Al–Mg–Sc–Zr alloy system. Experimental investigations based on aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and analytical tomography reveal the temporal evolution of precipitate ordering and formation of non-equilibrium structures with unprecedented spatial resolution, supported by thermodynamic calculations and diffusion simulations. This detailed view reveals atomic-scale spinodal decomposition to majorly define the ongoing diffusion process. It is illustrated that even small deviations in composition and ordering can have a considerable impact on a system’s evolution, due to the interplay of Gibbs energies, atomic jump activation energies and phase ordering, which may play an important role for multicomponent alloys."
483,Magneto-ionic control of magnetism using a solid-state proton pump,2018-11-12,"Voltage-gated ion transport as a means of manipulating magnetism electrically could enable ultralow-power memory, logic and sensor technologies. Earlier work made use of electric-field-driven O2− displacement to modulate magnetism in thin films by controlling interfacial or bulk oxidation states. However, elevated temperatures are required and chemical and structural changes lead to irreversibility and device degradation. Here we show reversible and non-destructive toggling of magnetic anisotropy at room temperature using a small gate voltage through H+ pumping in all-solid-state heterostructures. We achieve 90° magnetization switching by H+ insertion at a Co/GdOx interface, with no degradation in magnetic properties after >2,000 cycles. We then demonstrate reversible anisotropy gating by hydrogen loading in Pd/Co/Pd heterostructures, making metal–metal interfaces susceptible to voltage control. The hydrogen storage metals Pd and Pt are high spin–orbit coupling materials commonly used to generate perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction, and spin–orbit torques in ferromagnet/heavy-metal heterostructures. Thus, our work provides a platform for voltage-controlled spin–orbitronics."
484,Epitaxial growth of ultraflat stanene with topological band inversion,2018-11-05,"Two-dimensional (2D) topological materials, including quantum spin/anomalous Hall insulators, have attracted intense research efforts owing to their promise for applications ranging from low-power electronics and high-performance thermoelectrics to fault-tolerant quantum computation. One key challenge is to fabricate topological materials with a large energy gap for room-temperature use. Stanene—the tin counterpart of graphene—is a promising material candidate distinguished by its tunable topological states and sizeable bandgap. Recent experiments have successfully fabricated stanene, but none of them have yet observed topological states. Here we demonstrate the growth of high-quality stanene on Cu(111) by low-temperature molecular beam epitaxy. Importantly, we discovered an unusually ultraflat stanene showing an in-plane s–p band inversion together with a spin–orbit-coupling-induced topological gap (~0.3 eV) at the Γ point, which represents a foremost group-IV ultraflat graphene-like material displaying topological features in experiment. The finding of ultraflat stanene opens opportunities for exploring two-dimensional topological physics and device applications."
485,Molecular sieving of ethylene from ethane using a rigid metal–organic framework,2018-11-05,"There are great challenges in developing efficient adsorbents to replace the currently used and energy-intensive cryogenic distillation processes for olefin/paraffin separation, owing to the similar physical properties of the two molecules. Here we report an ultramicroporous metal–organic framework [Ca(C4O4)(H2O)], synthesized from calcium nitrate and squaric acid, that possesses rigid one-dimensional channels. These apertures are of a similar size to ethylene molecules, but owing to the size, shape and rigidity of the pores, act as molecular sieves to prevent the transport of ethane. The efficiency of this molecular sieve for the separation of ethylene/ethane mixtures is validated by breakthrough experiments with high ethylene productivity under ambient conditions. This material can be easily synthesized at the kilogram scale using an environmentally friendly method and is water-stable, which is important for potential industrial implementation. The strategy of using highly rigid metal–organic frameworks with well defined and rigid pores could also be extended to other porous materials for chemical separation processes."
486,Ferroelectrically tunable magnetic skyrmions in ultrathin oxide heterostructures,2018-11-05,"Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected whirling spin texture. Their nanoscale dimensions, topologically protected stability and solitonic nature, together are promising for future spintronics applications. To translate these compelling features into practical spintronic devices, a key challenge lies in achieving effective control of skyrmion properties, such as size, density and thermodynamic stability. Here, we report the discovery of ferroelectrically tunable skyrmions in ultrathin BaTiO3/SrRuO3 bilayer heterostructures. The ferroelectric proximity effect at the BaTiO3/SrRuO3 heterointerface triggers a sizeable Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction, thus stabilizing robust skyrmions with diameters less than a hundred nanometres. Moreover, by manipulating the ferroelectric polarization of the BaTiO3 layer, we achieve local, switchable and nonvolatile control of both skyrmion density and thermodynamic stability. This ferroelectrically tunable skyrmion system can simultaneously enhance the integratability and addressability of skyrmion-based functional devices."
487,Solving mazes with single-molecule DNA navigators,2018-11-05,"Molecular devices with information-processing capabilities hold great promise for developing intelligent nanorobotics. Here we demonstrate a DNA navigator system that can perform single-molecule parallel depth-first search on a ten-vertex rooted tree defined on a two-dimensional DNA origami platform. Pathfinding by the DNA navigators exploits a localized strand exchange cascade, which is initiated at a unique trigger site on the origami with subsequent automatic progression along paths defined by DNA hairpins containing a universal traversal sequence. Each single-molecule navigator autonomously explores one of the possible paths through the tree. A specific solution path connecting a given pair of start and end vertices can then be easily extracted from the set of all paths taken by the navigators collectively. The solution path laid out on origami is illustrated with single-molecule imaging. Our approach points towards the realization of molecular materials with embedded computational functions operating at the single-molecule level."
488,The role of defects and excess surface charges at finite temperature for optimizing oxide photoabsorbers,2018-10-29,"Computational screening of materials for solar to fuel conversion technologies has mostly focused on bulk properties, thus neglecting the structure and chemistry of surfaces and interfaces with water. We report a finite temperature study of WO3, a promising anode for photoelectrochemical cells, carried out using first-principles molecular dynamics simulations coupled with many-body perturbation theory. We identified three major factors determining the chemical reactivity of the material interfaced with water: the presence of surface defects, the dynamics of excess charge at the surface, and finite temperature fluctuations of the surface electronic orbitals. These general descriptors are essential for the understanding and prediction of optimal oxide photoabsorbers for water oxidation."
489,Hybrid photoelectrochemical and photovoltaic cells for simultaneous production of chemical fuels and electrical power,2018-10-29,"Harnessing solar energy to drive photoelectrochemical reactions is widely studied for sustainable fuel production and versatile energy storage over different timescales. However, the majority of solar photoelectrochemical cells cannot drive the overall photosynthesis reactions without the assistance of an external power source. A device for simultaneous and direct production of renewable fuels and electrical power from sunlight is now proposed. This hybrid photoelectrochemical and photovoltaic device allows tunable control over the branching ratio between two high-value products of solar energy conversion, requires relatively simple modification to existing photovoltaic technologies, and circumvents the photocurrent mismatches that lead to significant loss in tandem photoelectrochemical systems comprising chemically stable photoelectrodes. Our proof-of-concept device is based on a transition metal oxide photoanode monolithically integrated onto silicon that possesses both front- and backside photovoltaic junctions. This integrated assembly drives spontaneous overall water splitting with no external power source, while also producing electricity near the maximum power point of the backside photovoltaic junction. The concept that photogenerated charge carriers can be controllably directed to produce electricity and chemical fuel provides an opportunity to significantly increase the energy return on energy invested in solar fuels systems and can be adapted to a variety of architectures assembled from different materials."
490,Autoperforation of 2D materials for generating two-terminal memristive Janus particles,2018-10-23,"Graphene and other two-dimensional materials possess desirable mechanical, electrical and chemical properties for incorporation into or onto colloidal particles, potentially granting them unique electronic functions. However, this application has not yet been realized, because conventional top-down lithography scales poorly for producing colloidal solutions. Here, we develop an ‘autoperforation’ technique that provides a means of spontaneous assembly for surfaces composed of two-dimensional molecular scaffolds. Chemical vapour deposited two-dimensional sheets can autoperforate into circular envelopes when sandwiching a microprinted polymer composite disk of nanoparticle ink, allowing liftoff into solution and simultaneous assembly. The resulting colloidal microparticles have two independently addressable, external Janus faces that we show can function as an intraparticle array of vertically aligned, two-terminal electronic devices. Such particles demonstrate remarkable chemical and mechanical stability and form the basis of particulate electronic devices capable of collecting and storing information about their surroundings, extending nanoelectronics into previously inaccessible environments."
491,On-chip valley topological materials for elastic wave manipulation,2018-10-22,"Valley topological materials, in which electrons possess valley pseudospin, have attracted a growing interest recently. The additional valley degree of freedom offers a great potential for its use in information encoding and processing. The valley pseudospin and valley edge transport have been investigated in photonic and phononic crystals for electromagnetic and acoustic waves, respectively. In this work, by using a micromanufacturing technology, valley topological materials are fabricated on silicon chips, which allows the observation of gyral valley states and valley edge transport for elastic waves. The edge states protected by the valley topology are robust against the bending and weak randomness of the channel between distinct valley Hall phases. At the channel intersection, a counterintuitive partition of the valley edge states manifests for elastic waves, in which the partition ratio can be freely adjusted. These results may enable the creation of on-chip high-performance micro-ultrasonic materials and devices."
492,Spatial confinement downsizes the inflammatory response of macrophages,2018-10-22,"Macrophages respond to chemical/metabolic and physical stimuli, but their effects cannot be readily decoupled in vivo during pro-inflammatory activation. Here, we show that preventing macrophage spreading by spatial confinement, as imposed by micropatterning, microporous substrates or cell crowding, suppresses late lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated transcriptional programs (biomarkers IL-6, CXCL9, IL-1β, and iNOS) by mechanomodulating chromatin compaction and epigenetic alterations (HDAC3 levels and H3K36-dimethylation). Mechanistically, confinement reduces actin polymerization, thereby lowers the LPS-stimulated nuclear translocation of MRTF-A. This lowers the activity of the MRTF-A–SRF complex and subsequently downregulates the inflammatory response, as confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative PCR and RNA sequencing analysis. Confinement thus downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and, well before any activation processes, the phagocytic potential of macrophages. Contrarily, early events, including activation of the LPS receptor TLR4, and downstream NF-κB and IRF3 signalling and hence the expression of early LPS-responsive genes were marginally affected by confinement. These findings have broad implications in the context of mechanobiology, inflammation and immunology, as well as in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine."
493,A rhombohedral ferroelectric phase in epitaxially strained Hf,2018-10-22,"Hafnia-based thin films are a favoured candidate for the integration of robust ferroelectricity at the nanoscale into next-generation memory and logic devices. This is because their ferroelectric polarization becomes more robust as the size is reduced, exposing a type of ferroelectricity whose mechanism still remains to be understood. Thin films with increased crystal quality are therefore needed. We report the epitaxial growth of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thin films on (001)-oriented La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrTiO3 substrates. The films, which are under epitaxial compressive strain and predominantly (111)-oriented, display large ferroelectric polarization values up to 34 μC cm−2 and do not need wake-up cycling. Structural characterization reveals a rhombohedral phase, different from the commonly reported polar orthorhombic phase. This finding, in conjunction with density functional theory calculations, allows us to propose a compelling model for the formation of the ferroelectric phase. In addition, these results point towards thin films of simple oxides as a vastly unexplored class of nanoscale ferroelectrics."
494,High-mobility band-like charge transport in a semiconducting two-dimensional metal–organic framework,2018-10-15,"Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are hybrid materials based on crystalline coordination polymers that consist of metal ions connected by organic ligands. In addition to the traditional applications in gas storage and separation or catalysis, the long-range crystalline order in MOFs, as well as the tunable coupling between the organic and inorganic constituents, has led to the recent development of electrically conductive MOFs as a new generation of electronic materials. However, to date, the nature of charge transport in the MOFs has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate, using high-frequency terahertz photoconductivity and Hall effect measurements, Drude-type band-like transport in a semiconducting, π–d conjugated porous Fe3(THT)2(NH4)3 (THT, 2,3,6,7,10,11-triphenylenehexathiol) two-dimensional MOF, with a room-temperature mobility up to ~ 220 cm2 V–1 s–1. The temperature-dependent conductivity reveals that this mobility represents a lower limit for the material, as mobility is limited by impurity scattering. These results illustrate the potential for high-mobility semiconducting MOFs as active materials in thin-film optoelectronic devices."
495,Phase-selective synthesis of 1T′ MoS,2018-10-15,"Two-dimensional (2D) MoS2, which has great potential for optoelectronic and other applications, is thermodynamically stable and hence easily synthesized in its semiconducting 2H phase. In contrast, growth of its metastable 1T and 1T′ phases is hampered by their higher formation energy. Here we use theoretical calculations to design a potassium (K)-assisted chemical vapour deposition method for the phase-selective growth of 1T′ MoS2 monolayers and 1T′/2H heterophase bilayers. This is realized by tuning the concentration of K in the growth products to invert the stability of the 1T′ and 2H phases. The synthesis of 1T′ MoS2 monolayers with high phase purity allows us to characterize their intrinsic optical and electrical properties, revealing a characteristic in-plane anisotropy. This phase-controlled bottom-up synthesis offers a simple and efficient way of manipulating the relevant device structures, and provides a general approach for producing other metastable-phase 2D materials with unique properties."
496,Injectable tissue integrating networks from recombinant polypeptides with tunable order,2018-10-15,"Emergent properties of natural biomaterials result from the collective effects of nanoscale interactions among ordered and disordered domains. Here, using recombinant sequence design, we have created a set of partially ordered polypeptides to study emergent hierarchical structures by precisely encoding nanoscale order–disorder interactions. These materials, which combine the stimuli-responsiveness of disordered elastin-like polypeptides and the structural stability of polyalanine helices, are thermally responsive with tunable thermal hysteresis and the ability to reversibly form porous, viscoelastic networks above threshold temperatures. Through coarse-grain simulations, we show that hysteresis arises from physical crosslinking due to mesoscale phase separation of ordered and disordered domains. On injection of partially ordered polypeptides designed to transition at body temperature, they form stable, porous scaffolds that rapidly integrate into surrounding tissue with minimal inflammation and a high degree of vascularization. Sequence-level modulation of structural order and disorder is an untapped principle for the design of functional protein-based biomaterials."
497,Coatings super-repellent to ultralow surface tension liquids,2018-10-15,"High-performance coatings that durably and fully repel liquids are of interest for fundamental research and practical applications. Such coatings should allow for droplet beading, roll off and bouncing, which is difficult to achieve for ultralow surface tension liquids. Here we report a bottom-up approach to prepare super-repellent coatings using a mixture of fluorosilanes and cyanoacrylate. On application to surfaces, the coatings assemble into thin films of locally multi-re-entrant hierarchical structures with very low surface energies. The resulting materials are super-repellent to solvents, acids and bases, polymer solutions and ultralow surface tension liquids, characterized by ultrahigh liquid contact angles (>150°) and negligible roll-off angles (~0°). Furthermore, the coatings are transparent, durable and demonstrate universal liquid bouncing, tailored responsiveness and anti-freezing properties, and are thus a promising alternative to existing synthetic super-repellent coatings."
498,Polarity governs atomic interaction through two-dimensional materials,2018-10-08,"The transparency of two-dimensional (2D) materials to intermolecular interactions of crystalline materials has been an unresolved topic. Here we report that remote atomic interaction through 2D materials is governed by the binding nature, that is, the polarity of atomic bonds, both in the underlying substrates and in 2D material interlayers. Although the potential field from covalent-bonded materials is screened by a monolayer of graphene, that from ionic-bonded materials is strong enough to penetrate through a few layers of graphene. Such field penetration is substantially attenuated by 2D hexagonal boron nitride, which itself has polarization in its atomic bonds. Based on the control of transparency, modulated by the nature of materials as well as interlayer thickness, various types of single-crystalline materials across the periodic table can be epitaxially grown on 2D material-coated substrates. The epitaxial films can subsequently be released as free-standing membranes, which provides unique opportunities for the heterointegration of arbitrary single-crystalline thin films in functional applications."
499,Programmed assembly of synthetic protocells into thermoresponsive prototissues,2018-10-08,"Although several new types of synthetic cell-like entities are now available, their structural integration into spatially interlinked prototissues that communicate and display coordinated functions remains a considerable challenge. Here we describe the programmed assembly of synthetic prototissue constructs based on the bio-orthogonal adhesion of a spatially confined binary community of protein–polymer protocells, termed proteinosomes. The thermoresponsive properties of the interlinked proteinosomes are used collectively to generate prototissue spheroids capable of reversible contractions that can be enzymatically modulated and exploited for mechanochemical transduction. Overall, our methodology opens up a route to the fabrication of artificial tissue-like materials capable of collective behaviours, and addresses important emerging challenges in bottom-up synthetic biology and bioinspired engineering."
500,Topological quantum properties of chiral crystals,2018-10-01,"Chiral crystals are materials with a lattice structure that has a well-defined handedness due to the lack of inversion, mirror or other roto-inversion symmetries. Although it has been shown that the presence of crystalline symmetries can protect topological band crossings, the topological electronic properties of chiral crystals remain largely uncharacterized. Here we show that Kramers–Weyl fermions are a universal topological electronic property of all non-magnetic chiral crystals with spin–orbit coupling and are guaranteed by structural chirality, lattice translation and time-reversal symmetry. Unlike conventional Weyl fermions, they appear at time-reversal-invariant momenta. We identify representative chiral materials in 33 of the 65 chiral space groups in which Kramers–Weyl fermions are relevant to the low-energy physics. We determine that all point-like nodal degeneracies in non-magnetic chiral crystals with relevant spin–orbit coupling carry non-trivial Chern numbers. Kramers–Weyl materials can exhibit a monopole-like electron spin texture and topologically non-trivial bulk Fermi surfaces over an unusually large energy window."
501,Ultrafast water harvesting and transport in hierarchical microchannels,2018-09-24,"Various natural materials have hierarchical microscale and nanoscale structures that allow for directional water transport. Here we report an ultrafast water transport process in the surface of a Sarracenia trichome, whose transport velocity is about three orders of magnitude faster than those measured in cactus spine and spider silk. The high velocity of water transport is attributed to the unique hierarchical microchannel organization of the trichome. Two types of ribs with different height regularly distribute around the trichome cone, where two neighbouring high ribs form a large channel that contains 1–5 low ribs that define smaller base channels. This results in two successive but distinct modes of water transport. Initially, a rapid thin film of water is formed inside the base channels (Mode I), which is followed by ultrafast water sliding on top of that thin film (Mode II). This two-step ultrafast water transport mechanism is modelled and experimentally tested in bio-inspired microchannels, which demonstrates the potential of this hierarchal design for microfluidic applications."
502,Large electrostrictive response in lead halide perovskites,2018-09-24,"Lead halide perovskites have demonstrated outstanding performance in photovoltaics, photodetectors, radiation detectors and light-emitting diodes. However, the electromechanical properties, which are the main application of inorganic perovskites, have rarely been explored for lead halide perovskites. Here, we report the discovery of a large electrostrictive response in methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) single crystals. Under an electric field of 3.7 V µm−1, MAPbI3 shows a large compressive strain of 1%, corresponding to a mechanical energy density of 0.74 J cm−3, comparable to that of human muscles. The influences of piezoelectricity, thermal expansion, intrinsic electrostrictive effect, Maxwell stress, ferroelectricity, local polar fluctuation and methylammonium cation ordering on this electromechanical response are excluded. We speculate, using density functional theory, that electrostriction of MAPbI3 probably originates from lattice deformation due to formation of additional defects under applied bias. The discovery of large electrostriction in lead iodide perovskites may lead to new potential applications in actuators, sonar and micro-electromechanical systems and aid the understanding of other field-dependent material properties."
503,Golden single-atomic-site platinum electrocatalysts,2018-09-24,"Bimetallic nanoparticles with tailored structures constitute a desirable model system for catalysts, as crucial factors such as geometric and electronic effects can be readily controlled by tailoring the structure and alloy bonding of the catalytic site. Here we report a facile colloidal method to prepare a series of platinum–gold (PtAu) nanoparticles with tailored surface structures and particle diameters on the order of 7 nm. Samples with low Pt content, particularly Pt4Au96, exhibited unprecedented electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of formic acid. A high forward current density of 3.77 A mgPt−1 was observed for Pt4Au96, a value two orders of magnitude greater than those observed for core–shell structured Pt78Au22 and a commercial Pt nanocatalyst. Extensive structural characterization and theoretical density functional theory simulations of the best-performing catalysts revealed densely packed single-atom Pt surface sites surrounded by Au atoms, which suggests that their superior catalytic activity and selectivity could be attributed to the unique structural and alloy-bonding properties of these single-atomic-site catalysts."
504,4π-periodic Andreev bound states in a Dirac semimetal,2018-09-17,"Although signatures of superconductivity in Dirac semimetals have been reported, for instance by applying pressure or using point contacts, our understanding of the topological aspects of Dirac semimetal superconductivity is still developing. Here, we utilize nanoscale phase-sensitive junction technology to induce superconductivity in the Dirac semimetal Bi1−xSbx. Our radiofrequency irradiation experiments then reveal a significant contribution of 4π-periodic Andreev bound states to the supercurrent in Nb–Bi0.97Sb0.03–Nb Josephson junctions. The conditions for a substantial 4π contribution to the supercurrent are favourable because of the Dirac cone’s very broad transmission resonances and a measurement frequency faster than the quasiparticle poisoning rate. In addition, we show that a magnetic field applied in the plane of the junction allows tuning of the Josephson junctions from 0 to π regimes. Our results open the technologically appealing avenue of employing the topological bulk properties of Dirac semimetals for topological superconductivity research and topological quantum computer development."
505,The mechanism of the ultrafast crystal growth of pure metals from their melts,2018-09-17,"Pure metals can have ultrafast growth rates from their melts, such as a crystal of pure nickel that grows at a rate reaching 70 m s−1. These extraordinary growth rates suggest that metallic crystals might provide the next generation of phase-change materials. The huge crystal growth rates of metals are the consequence of kinetics without activated control, in sharp contrast to the prediction of the ‘classic’ theory of crystal growth. While the existence of barrierless growth kinetics is now well established in atomic melts, the physical explanation for the absence of an activation barrier to ordering remains unclear. It is something of a paradox that diffusion in the liquid metal is governed by thermal activation while the movement of the same atoms organizing into a crystal is not. Here we use computer simulations of crystallization in pure metals to explicitly resolve the origin of the barrierless growth kinetics."
506,Fluid-enhanced surface diffusion controls intraparticle phase transformations,2018-09-17,"Phase transformations driven by compositional change require mass flux across a phase boundary. In some anisotropic solids, however, the phase boundary moves along a non-conductive crystallographic direction. One such material is LiXFePO4, an electrode for lithium-ion batteries. With poor bulk ionic transport along the direction of phase separation, it is unclear how lithium migrates during phase transformations. Here, we show that lithium migrates along the solid/liquid interface without leaving the particle, whereby charge carriers do not cross the double layer. X-ray diffraction and microscopy experiments as well as ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that organic solvent and water molecules promote this surface ion diffusion, effectively rendering LiXFePO4 a three-dimensional lithium-ion conductor. Phase-field simulations capture the effects of surface diffusion on phase transformation. Lowering surface diffusivity is crucial towards supressing phase separation. This work establishes fluid-enhanced surface diffusion as a key dial for tuning phase transformation in anisotropic solids."
507,A multicaloric cooling cycle that exploits thermal hysteresis,2018-09-10,"The giant magnetocaloric effect, in which large thermal changes are induced in a material on the application of a magnetic field, can be used for refrigeration applications, such as the cooling of systems from a small to a relatively large scale. However, commercial uptake is limited. We propose an approach to magnetic cooling that rejects the conventional idea that the hysteresis inherent in magnetostructural phase-change materials must be minimized to maximize the reversible magnetocaloric effect. Instead, we introduce a second stimulus, uniaxial stress, so that we can exploit the hysteresis. This allows us to lock-in the ferromagnetic phase as the magnetizing field is removed, which drastically removes the volume of the magnetic field source and so reduces the amount of expensive Nd–Fe–B permanent magnets needed for a magnetic refrigerator. In addition, the mass ratio between the magnetocaloric material and the permanent magnet can be increased, which allows scaling of the cooling power of a device simply by increasing the refrigerant body. The technical feasibility of this hysteresis-positive approach is demonstrated using Ni–Mn–In Heusler alloys. Our study could lead to an enhanced usage of the giant magnetocaloric effect in commercial applications."
508,Molecularly thin two-dimensional hybrid perovskites with tunable optoelectronic properties due to reversible surface relaxation,2018-09-10,"Due to their layered structure, two-dimensional Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites (RPPs), composed of multiple organic/inorganic quantum wells, can in principle be exfoliated down to few and single layers. These molecularly thin layers are expected to present unique properties with respect to the bulk counterpart, due to increased lattice deformations caused by interface strain. Here, we have synthesized centimetre-sized, pure-phase single-crystal RPP perovskites (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1–4) from which single quantum well layers have been exfoliated. We observed a reversible shift in excitonic energies induced by laser annealing on exfoliated layers encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride. Moreover, a highly efficient photodetector was fabricated using a molecularly thin n = 4 RPP crystal, showing a photogain of 105 and an internal quantum efficiency of ~34%. Our results suggest that, thanks to their dynamic structure, atomically thin perovskites enable an additional degree of control for the bandgap engineering of these materials"
509,Compositional and orientational control in metal halide perovskites of reduced dimensionality,2018-09-10,"Reduced-dimensional metal halide perovskites (RDPs) have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their promising light harvesting and emissive properties. We sought to increase the systematic understanding of how RDPs are formed. Here we report that layered intermediate complexes formed with the solvent provide a scaffold that facilitates the nucleation and growth of RDPs during annealing, as observed via in situ X-ray scattering. Transient absorption spectroscopy of RDP single crystals and films enables the identification of the distribution of quantum well thicknesses. These insights allow us to develop a kinetic model of RDP formation that accounts for the experimentally observed size distribution of wells. RDPs exhibit a thickness distribution (with sizes that extend above n = 5) determined largely by the stoichiometric proportion between the intercalating cation and solvent complexes. The results indicate a means to control the distribution, composition and orientation of RDPs via the selection of the intercalating cation, the solvent and the deposition technique."
510,Decoupling the role of stress and corrosion in the intergranular cracking of noble-metal alloys,2018-09-10,"Intergranular stress-corrosion cracking (IGSCC) is a form of environmentally induced crack propagation causing premature failure of elemental metals and alloys. It is believed to require the simultaneous presence of tensile stress and corrosion; however, the exact nature of this synergy has eluded experimental identification. For noble metal alloys such as Ag–Au, IGSCC is a consequence of dealloying corrosion, forming a nanoporous gold layer that is believed to have the ability to transmit cracks into grain boundaries in un-dealloyed parent phase via a pure mechanical process. Here using atomic-scale techniques and statistical characterizations for this alloy system, we show that the separate roles of stress and anodic dissolution can be decoupled and that the apparent synergy exists owing to rapid time-dependent morphology changes at the dealloyed layer/parent phase interface. We discuss the applicability of our findings to the IGSCC of important engineering Fe- and Ni-based alloys in critical applications."
511,Imaging orbital-selective quasiparticles in the Hund’s metal state of FeSe,2018-09-03,"Strong electronic correlations, emerging from the parent Mott insulator phase, are key to copper-based high-temperature superconductivity. By contrast, the parent phase of an iron-based high-temperature superconductor is never a correlated insulator. However, this distinction may be deceptive because Fe has five actived d orbitals while Cu has only one. In theory, such orbital multiplicity can generate a Hund’s metal state, in which alignment of the Fe spins suppresses inter-orbital fluctuations, producing orbitally selective strong correlations. The spectral weights Zm of quasiparticles associated with different Fe orbitals m should then be radically different. Here we use quasiparticle scattering interference resolved by orbital content to explore these predictions in FeSe. Signatures of strong, orbitally selective differences of quasiparticle Zm appear on all detectable bands over a wide energy range. Further, the quasiparticle interference amplitudes reveal that \(Z_{xy} < Z_{xz} \ll Z_{yz}\), consistent with earlier orbital-selective Cooper pairing studies. Thus, orbital-selective strong correlations dominate the parent state of iron-based high-temperature superconductivity in FeSe."
512,Efficient electrical detection of mid-infrared graphene plasmons at room temperature,2018-08-27,"Optical excitation and subsequent decay of graphene plasmons can produce a significant increase in charge-carrier temperature. An efficient method to convert this temperature elevation into electrical signals can enable important mid-infrared applications. However, the modest thermoelectric coefficient and weak temperature dependence of carrier transport in graphene hinder this goal. Here, we demonstrate mid-infrared graphene detectors consisting of arrays of plasmonic resonators interconnected by quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons. Localized barriers associated with disorder in the nanoribbons produce a dramatic temperature dependence of carrier transport, thus enabling the electrical detection of plasmon decay in the nearby graphene resonators. Our device has a subwavelength footprint of 5 × 5 μm2 and operates at 12.2 μm with an external responsivity of 16 mA W–1 and a low noise-equivalent power of 1.3 nW Hz–1/2 at room temperature. It is fabricated using large-scale graphene and possesses a simple two-terminal geometry, representing an essential step towards the realization of an on-chip graphene mid-infrared detector array."
513,Chemical nature of ferroelastic twin domains in CH,2018-08-27,"The extraordinary optoelectronic performance of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites has resulted in extensive efforts to unravel their properties. Recently, observations of ferroic twin domains in methylammonium lead triiodide drew significant attention as a possible explanation for the current–voltage hysteretic behaviour in these materials. However, the properties of the twin domains, their local chemistry and the chemical impact on optoelectronic performance remain unclear. Here, using multimodal chemical and functional imaging methods, we unveil the mechanical origin of the twin domain contrast observed with piezoresponse force microscopy in methylammonium lead triiodide. By combining experimental results with first principles simulations we reveal an inherent coupling between ferroelastic twin domains and chemical segregation. These results reveal an interplay of ferroic properties and chemical segregation on the optoelectronic performance of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites, and offer an exploratory path to improving functional devices."
514,A conductive topological insulator with large spin Hall effect for ultralow power spin–orbit torque switching,2018-07-30,"Spin–orbit torque switching using the spin Hall effect in heavy metals and topological insulators has a great potential for ultralow power magnetoresistive random-access memory. To be competitive with conventional spin-transfer torque switching, a pure spin current source with a large spin Hall angle (θSH > 1) and high electrical conductivity (σ > 105 Ω−1 m−1) is required. Here we demonstrate such a pure spin current source: conductive topological insulator BiSb thin films with σ ≈ 2.5 × 105 Ω−1 m−1, θSH ≈ 52 and spin Hall conductivity σSH ≈ 1.3 × 107 \(\frac{\hbar }{{2e}}\)Ω−1 m−1 at room temperature. We show that BiSb thin films can generate a very large spin–orbit field of 2.3 kOe MA–1 cm2 and a critical switching current density as low as 1.5 MA cm–2 in Bi0.9Sb0.1/MnGa bilayers, which underlines the potential of BiSb for industrial applications."
515,Robust microscale superlubricity in graphite/hexagonal boron nitride layered heterojunctions,2018-07-30,"Structural superlubricity is a fascinating tribological phenomenon, in which the lateral interactions between two incommensurate contacting surfaces are effectively cancelled resulting in ultralow sliding friction. Here we report the experimental realization of robust superlubricity in microscale monocrystalline heterojunctions, which constitutes an important step towards the macroscopic scale-up of superlubricity. The results for interfaces between graphite and hexagonal boron nitride clearly demonstrate that structural superlubricity persists even when the aligned contact sustains external loads under ambient conditions. The observed frictional anisotropy in the heterojunctions is found to be orders of magnitude smaller than that measured for their homogeneous counterparts. Atomistic simulations reveal that the underlying frictional mechanisms in the two cases originate from completely different dynamical regimes. Our results are expected to be of a general nature and should be applicable to other van der Waals heterostructures."
516,Room-temperature high spin–orbit torque due to quantum confinement in sputtered Bi,2018-07-30,"The spin–orbit torque (SOT) that arises from materials with large spin–orbit coupling promises a path for ultralow power and fast magnetic-based storage and computational devices. We investigated the SOT from magnetron-sputtered BixSe(1–x) thin films in BixSe(1–x)/Co20Fe60B20 heterostructures by using d.c. planar Hall and spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) methods. Remarkably, the spin torque efficiency (θS) was determined to be as large as 18.62 ± 0.13 and 8.67 ± 1.08 using the d.c. planar Hall and ST-FMR methods, respectively. Moreover, switching of the perpendicular CoFeB multilayers using the SOT from the BixSe(1–x) was observed at room temperature with a low critical magnetization switching current density of 4.3 × 105 A cm–2. Quantum transport simulations using a realistic sp3 tight-binding model suggests that the high SOT in sputtered BixSe(1–x) is due to the quantum confinement effect with a charge-to-spin conversion efficiency that enhances with reduced size and dimensionality. The demonstrated θS, ease of growth of the films on a silicon substrate and successful growth and switching of perpendicular CoFeB multilayers on BixSe(1–x) films provide an avenue for the use of BixSe(1–x) as a spin density generator in SOT-based memory and logic devices."
517,Structural evolution of titanium dioxide during reduction in high-pressure hydrogen,2018-07-16,"The excellent photocatalytic properties of titanium oxide (TiO2) under ultraviolet light have long motivated the search for doping strategies capable of extending its photoactivity to the visible part of the spectrum. One approach is high-pressure and high-temperature hydrogenation, which results in reduced ‘black TiO2’ nanoparticles with a crystalline core and a disordered shell that absorbs visible light. Here we elucidate the formation mechanism and structural features of black TiO2 using first-principles-validated reactive force field molecular dynamics simulations of anatase TiO2 surfaces and nanoparticles at high temperature and under high hydrogen pressures. Simulations reveal that surface oxygen vacancies created upon reaction of H2 with surface oxygen atoms diffuse towards the bulk material but encounter a high barrier for subsurface migration on {001} facets of the nanoparticles, which initiates surface disordering. Besides confirming that the hydrogenated amorphous shell has a key role in the photoactivity of black TiO2, our results provide insight into the properties of the disordered surface layers that are observed on regular anatase nanocrystals under photocatalytic water-splitting conditions."
518,Large anomalous Hall current induced by topological nodal lines in a ferromagnetic van der Waals semimetal,2018-07-16,"Topological semimetals host electronic structures with several band-contact points or lines and are generally expected to exhibit strong topological responses. Up to now, most work has been limited to non-magnetic materials and the interplay between topology and magnetism in this class of quantum materials has been largely unexplored. Here we utilize theoretical calculations, magnetotransport and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to propose Fe3GeTe2, a van der Waals material, as a candidate ferromagnetic (FM) nodal line semimetal. We find that the spin degree of freedom is fully quenched by the large FM polarization, but the line degeneracy is protected by crystalline symmetries that connect two orbitals in adjacent layers. This orbital-driven nodal line is tunable by spin orientation due to spin–orbit coupling and produces a large Berry curvature, which leads to a large anomalous Hall current, angle and factor. These results demonstrate that FM topological semimetals hold significant potential for spin- and orbital-dependent electronic functionalities."
519,Design rules for minimizing voltage losses in high-efficiency organic solar cells,2018-07-16,"The open-circuit voltage of organic solar cells is usually lower than the values achieved in inorganic or perovskite photovoltaic devices with comparable bandgaps. Energy losses during charge separation at the donor–acceptor interface and non-radiative recombination are among the main causes of such voltage losses. Here we combine spectroscopic and quantum-chemistry approaches to identify key rules for minimizing voltage losses: (1) a low energy offset between donor and acceptor molecular states and (2) high photoluminescence yield of the low-gap material in the blend. Following these rules, we present a range of existing and new donor–acceptor systems that combine efficient photocurrent generation with electroluminescence yield up to 0.03%, leading to non-radiative voltage losses as small as 0.21 V. This study provides a rationale to explain and further improve the performance of recently demonstrated high-open-circuit-voltage organic solar cells."
520,Surface distortion as a unifying concept and descriptor in oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysis,2018-07-16,"Tuning the surface structure at the atomic level is of primary importance to simultaneously meet the electrocatalytic performance and stability criteria required for the development of low-temperature proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, transposing the knowledge acquired on extended, model surfaces to practical nanomaterials remains highly challenging. Here, we propose ‘surface distortion’ as a novel structural descriptor, which is able to reconciliate and unify seemingly opposing notions and contradictory experimental observations in regards to the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) reactivity. Beyond its unifying character, we show that surface distortion is pivotal to rationalize the electrocatalytic properties of state-of-the-art of PtNi/C nanocatalysts with distinct atomic composition, size, shape and degree of surface defectiveness under a simulated PEMFC cathode environment. Our study brings fundamental and practical insights into the role of surface defects in electrocatalysis and highlights strategies to design more durable ORR nanocatalysts."
521,Impacts of surface depletion on the plasmonic properties of doped semiconductor nanocrystals,2018-07-09,"Degenerately doped semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike metals, semiconductor NCs offer tunable LSPR characteristics enabled by doping, or via electrochemical or photochemical charging. Tuning plasmonic properties through carrier density modulation suggests potential applications in smart optoelectronics, catalysis and sensing. Here, we elucidate fundamental aspects of LSPR modulation through dynamic carrier density tuning in Sn-doped In2O3 (Sn:In2O3) NCs. Monodisperse Sn:In2O3 NCs with various doping levels and sizes were synthesized and assembled in uniform films. NC films were then charged in an in situ electrochemical cell and the LSPR modulation spectra were monitored. Based on spectral shifts and intensity modulation of the LSPR, combined with optical modelling, it was found that often-neglected semiconductor properties, specifically band structure modification due to doping and surface states, strongly affect LSPR modulation. Fermi level pinning by surface defect states creates a surface depletion layer that alters the LSPR properties; it determines the extent of LSPR frequency modulation, diminishes the expected near-field enhancement, and strongly reduces sensitivity of the LSPR to the surroundings."
522,Non-specific interactions govern cytosolic diffusion of nanosized objects in mammalian cells,2018-07-02,"The diffusivity of macromolecules in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells varies over orders of magnitude and dictates the kinetics of cellular processes. However, a general description that associates the Brownian or anomalous nature of intracellular diffusion to the architectural and biochemical properties of the cytoplasm has not been achieved. Here we measure the mobility of individual fluorescent nanoparticles in living mammalian cells to obtain a comprehensive analysis of cytoplasmic diffusion. We identify a correlation between tracer size, its biochemical nature and its mobility. Inert particles with size equal or below 50 nm behave as Brownian particles diffusing in a medium of low viscosity with negligible effects of molecular crowding. Increasing the strength of non-specific interactions of the nanoparticles within the cytoplasm gradually reduces their mobility and leads to subdiffusive behaviour. These experimental observations and the transition from Brownian to subdiffusive motion can be captured in a minimal phenomenological model."
523,Long-range symmetry breaking in embedded ferroelectrics,2018-06-25,"The characteristic functionality of ferroelectric materials is due to the symmetry of their crystalline structure. As such, ferroelectrics lend themselves to design approaches that manipulate this structural symmetry by introducing extrinsic strain. Using in situ dark-field X-ray microscopy to map lattice distortions around deeply embedded domain walls and grain boundaries in BaTiO3, we reveal that symmetry-breaking strain fields extend up to several micrometres from domain walls. As this exceeds the average domain width, no part of the material is elastically relaxed, and symmetry is universally broken. Such extrinsic strains are pivotal in defining the local properties and self-organization of embedded domain walls, and must be accounted for by emerging computational approaches to material design."
524,The relation of local order to material properties in relaxor ferroelectrics,2018-06-25,"Correlating electromechanical and dielectric properties with nanometre-scale order is the defining challenge for the development of piezoelectric oxides. Current lead (Pb)-based relaxor ferroelectrics can serve as model systems with which to unravel these correlations, but the nature of the local order and its relation to material properties remains controversial. Here we employ recent advances in diffuse scattering instrumentation to investigate crystals that span the phase diagram of PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3-xPbTiO3 (PMN-xPT) and identify four forms of local order. From the compositional dependence, we resolve the coupling of each form to the dielectric and electromechanical properties observed. We show that relaxor behaviour does not correlate simply with ferroic diffuse scattering; instead, it results from a competition between local antiferroelectric correlations, seeded by chemical short-range order, and local ferroic order. The ferroic diffuse scattering is strongest where piezoelectricity is maximal and displays previously unrecognized modulations caused by anion displacements. Our observations provide new guidelines for evaluating displacive models and hence the piezoelectric properties of environmentally friendly next-generation materials."
525,Interplay of water and reactive elements in oxidation of alumina-forming alloys,2018-06-11,"High-temperature alloys are crucial to many important technologies that underpin our civilization. All these materials rely on forming an external oxide layer (scale) for corrosion protection. Despite decades of research on oxide scale growth, many open questions remain, including the crucial role of the so-called reactive elements and water. Here, we reveal the hitherto unknown interplay between reactive elements and water during alumina scale growth, causing a metastable ‘messy’ nano-structured alumina layer to form. We propose that reactive-element-decorated, hydroxylated interfaces between alumina nanograins enable water to access an inner cathode in the bottom of the scale, at odds with the established scale growth scenario. As evidence, hydride-nanodomains and reactive element/hydrogen (deuterium) co-variation are observed in the alumina scale. The defect-rich alumina subsequently recrystallizes to form a protective scale. First-principles modelling is also performed to validate the RE effect. Our findings open up promising avenues in oxidation research and suggest ways to improve alloy properties."
526,"Re-entrant charge order in overdoped (Bi,Pb)",2018-06-11,"In the underdoped regime, the cuprate high-temperature superconductors exhibit a host of unusual collective phenomena, including unconventional spin and charge density modulations, Fermi surface reconstructions, and a pseudogap in various physical observables. Conversely, overdoped cuprates are generally regarded as conventional Fermi liquids possessing no collective electronic order. In partial contradiction to this widely held picture, we report resonant X-ray scattering measurements revealing incommensurate charge order reflections for overdoped (Bi,Pb)2.12Sr1.88CuO6+δ (Bi2201), with correlation lengths of 40–60 lattice units, that persist up to temperatures of at least 250 K. The value of the charge order wavevector decreases with doping, in line with the extrapolation of the trend previously observed in underdoped Bi2201. In overdoped materials, however, charge order coexists with a single, unreconstructed Fermi surface without nesting or pseudogap features. The discovery of re-entrant charge order in Bi2201 thus calls for investigations in other cuprate families and for a reconsideration of theories that posit an essential relationship between these phenomena."
527,Fully textured monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with 25.2% power conversion efficiency,2018-06-11,"Tandem devices combining perovskite and silicon solar cells are promising candidates to achieve power conversion efficiencies above 30% at reasonable costs. State-of-the-art monolithic two-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem devices have so far featured silicon bottom cells that are polished on their front side to be compatible with the perovskite fabrication process. This concession leads to higher potential production costs, higher reflection losses and non-ideal light trapping. To tackle this issue, we developed a top cell deposition process that achieves the conformal growth of multiple compounds with controlled optoelectronic properties directly on the micrometre-sized pyramids of textured monocrystalline silicon. Tandem devices featuring a silicon heterojunction cell and a nanocrystalline silicon recombination junction demonstrate a certified steady-state efficiency of 25.2%. Our optical design yields a current density of 19.5 mA cm−2 thanks to the silicon pyramidal texture and suggests a path for the realization of 30% monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem devices."
528,Therapeutic luminal coating of the intestine,2018-06-11,"The gastrointestinal tract is the site of most drug delivery and therapeutic interventions for the management and treatment of numerous diseases. However, selective access to its mucosa, especially in the small bowel, is challenging. Here we develop an orally administered gut-coating formulation that provides a transient coating of the bowel. Through a materials screening campaign, we identified a sucrose octasulfate aluminium complex and further engineered the pH-dependent material into a complex coacervate formulation linked via pH-independent electrostatic interaction, which allowed an effective transient physical coating on the gastrointestinal mucosa, independent of gastric acid exposure. We tested the therapeutic values of this technology in two settings. Oral administration of this gut-coating formulation modulated the nutrient contact with bowel mucosa, which lowered the glucose responses in rodent models indicating a potential therapeutic utility in diabetes. Furthermore, the formulation protected biological agents from gastric acid exposure and degradation, which enabled oral delivery to the small bowel mucosa."
529,Local immunomodulation with Fas ligand-engineered biomaterials achieves allogeneic islet graft acceptance,2018-06-04,"Islet transplantation is a promising therapy for type 1 diabetes. However, chronic immunosuppression to control rejection of allogeneic islets induces morbidities and impairs islet function. T effector cells are responsible for islet allograft rejection and express Fas death receptors following activation, becoming sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Here, we report that localized immunomodulation using microgels presenting an apoptotic form of the Fas ligand with streptavidin (SA-FasL) results in prolonged survival of allogeneic islet grafts in diabetic mice. A short course of rapamycin treatment boosted the immunomodulatory efficacy of SA-FasL microgels, resulting in acceptance and function of allografts over 200 days. Survivors generated normal systemic responses to donor antigens, implying immune privilege of the graft, and had increased CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T regulatory cells in the graft and draining lymph nodes. Deletion of T regulatory cells resulted in acute rejection of established islet allografts. This localized immunomodulatory biomaterial-enabled approach may provide an alternative to chronic immunosuppression for clinical islet transplantation."
530,Electron delocalization and charge mobility as a function of reduction in a metal–organic framework,2018-06-04,"Conductive metal–organic frameworks are an emerging class of three-dimensional architectures with degrees of modularity, synthetic flexibility and structural predictability that are unprecedented in other porous materials. However, engendering long-range charge delocalization and establishing synthetic strategies that are broadly applicable to the diverse range of structures encountered for this class of materials remain challenging. Here, we report the synthesis of K
                  x
                Fe2(BDP)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2; BDP2− = 1,4-benzenedipyrazolate), which exhibits full charge delocalization within the parent framework and charge mobilities comparable to technologically relevant polymers and ceramics. Through a battery of spectroscopic methods, computational techniques and single-microcrystal field-effect transistor measurements, we demonstrate that fractional reduction of Fe2(BDP)3 results in a metal–organic framework that displays a nearly 10,000-fold enhancement in conductivity along a single crystallographic axis. The attainment of such properties in a K
                  x
                Fe2(BDP)3 field-effect transistor represents the realization of a general synthetic strategy for the creation of new porous conductor-based devices."
531,Self-assembled highly ordered acid layers in precisely sulfonated polyethylene produce efficient proton transport,2018-05-28,"Recent advances in polymer synthesis have allowed remarkable control over chain microstructure and conformation. Capitalizing on such developments, here we create well-controlled chain folding in sulfonated polyethylene, leading to highly uniform hydrated acid layers of subnanometre thickness with high proton conductivity. The linear polyethylene contains sulfonic acid groups pendant to precisely every twenty-first carbon atom that induce tight chain folds to form the hydrated layers, while the methylene segments crystallize. The proton conductivity is on par with Nafion 117, the benchmark for fuel cell membranes. We demonstrate that well-controlled hairpin chain folding can be utilized for proton conductivity within a crystalline polymer structure, and we project that this structure could be adapted for ion transport. This layered polyethylene-based structure is an innovative and versatile design paradigm for functional polymer membranes, opening doors to efficient and selective transport of other ions and small molecules on appropriate selection of functional groups."
532,Significant Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction at graphene–ferromagnet interfaces due to the Rashba effect,2018-05-28,The possibility of utilizing the rich spin-dependent properties of graphene has attracted much attention in the pursuit of spintronics advances. The promise of high-speed and low-energy-consumption devices motivates the search for layered structures that stabilize chiral spin textures such as topologically protected skyrmions. Here we demonstrate that chiral spin textures are induced at graphene/ferromagnetic metal interfaces. Graphene is a weak spin–orbit coupling material and is generally not expected to induce a sufficient Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction to affect magnetic chirality. We demonstrate that indeed graphene does induce a type of Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction due to the Rashba effect. First-principles calculations and experiments using spin-polarized electron microscopy show that this graphene-induced Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction can have a similar magnitude to that at interfaces with heavy metals. This work paves a path towards two-dimensional-material-based spin–orbitronics.
533,An autonomously electrically self-healing liquid metal–elastomer composite for robust soft-matter robotics and electronics,2018-05-21,"Large-area stretchable electronics are critical for progress in wearable computing, soft robotics and inflatable structures. Recent efforts have focused on engineering electronics from soft materials—elastomers, polyelectrolyte gels and liquid metal. While these materials enable elastic compliance and deformability, they are vulnerable to tearing, puncture and other mechanical damage modes that cause electrical failure. Here, we introduce a material architecture for soft and highly deformable circuit interconnects that are electromechanically stable under typical loading conditions, while exhibiting uncompromising resilience to mechanical damage. The material is composed of liquid metal droplets suspended in a soft elastomer; when damaged, the droplets rupture to form new connections with neighbours and re-route electrical signals without interruption. Since self-healing occurs spontaneously, these materials do not require manual repair or external heat. We demonstrate this unprecedented electronic robustness in a self-repairing digital counter and self-healing soft robotic quadruped that continue to function after significant damage."
534,Mechanics-guided embryonic patterning of neuroectoderm tissue from human pluripotent stem cells,2018-05-21,"Classic embryological studies have successfully applied genetics and cell biology principles to understand embryonic development. However, it remains unresolved how mechanics, as an integral driver of development, is involved in controlling tissue-scale cell fate patterning. Here we report a micropatterned human pluripotent stem (hPS)-cell-based neuroectoderm developmental model, in which pre-patterned geometrical confinement induces emergent patterning of neuroepithelial and neural plate border cells, mimicking neuroectoderm regionalization during early neurulation in vivo. In this hPS-cell-based neuroectoderm patterning model, two tissue-scale morphogenetic signals—cell shape and cytoskeletal contractile force—instruct neuroepithelial/neural plate border patterning via BMP-SMAD signalling. We further show that ectopic mechanical activation and exogenous BMP signalling modulation are sufficient to perturb neuroepithelial/neural plate border patterning. This study provides a useful microengineered, hPS-cell-based model with which to understand the biomechanical principles that guide neuroectoderm patterning and hence to study neural development and disease."
535,Dual-function injectable angiogenic biomaterial for the repair of brain tissue following stroke,2018-05-21,"Stroke is the primary cause of disability due to the brain's limited ability to regenerate damaged tissue. After stroke, an increased inflammatory and immune response coupled with severely limited angiogenesis and neuronal growth results in a stroke cavity devoid of normal brain tissue. In the adult, therapeutic angiogenic materials have been used to repair ischaemic tissues through the formation of vascular networks. However, whether a therapeutic angiogenic material can regenerate brain tissue and promote neural repair is poorly understood. Here we show that the delivery of an engineered immune-modulating angiogenic biomaterial directly to the stroke cavity promotes tissue formation de novo, and results in axonal networks along thee generated blood vessels. This regenerated tissue produces functional recovery through the established axonal networks. Thus, this biomaterials approach generates a vascularized network of regenerated functional neuronal connections within previously dead tissue and lays the groundwork for the use of angiogenic materials to repair other neurologically diseased tissues."
536,Electron–phonon interaction in efficient perovskite blue emitters,2018-05-14,"Low-dimensional perovskites have—in view of their high radiative recombination rates—shown great promise in achieving high luminescence brightness and colour saturation. Here we investigate the effect of electron–phonon interactions on the luminescence of single crystals of two-dimensional perovskites, showing that reducing these interactions can lead to bright blue emission in two-dimensional perovskites. Resonance Raman spectra and deformation potential analysis show that strong electron–phonon interactions result in fast non-radiative decay, and that this lowers the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Neutron scattering, solid-state NMR measurements of spin–lattice relaxation, density functional theory simulations and experimental atomic displacement measurements reveal that molecular motion is slowest, and rigidity greatest, in the brightest emitter. By varying the molecular configuration of the ligands, we show that a PLQY up to 79% and linewidth of 20 nm can be reached by controlling crystal rigidity and electron–phonon interactions. Designing crystal structures with electron–phonon interactions in mind offers a previously underexplored avenue to improve optoelectronic materials' performance."
537,Vapour–liquid–solid growth of monolayer MoS,2018-04-23,"Chemical vapour deposition of two-dimensional materials typically involves the conversion of vapour precursors to solid products in a vapour–solid–solid mode. Here, we report the vapour–liquid–solid growth of monolayer MoS2, yielding highly crystalline ribbons with a width of few tens to thousands of nanometres. This vapour–liquid–solid growth is triggered by the reaction between MoO3 and NaCl, which results in the formation of molten Na–Mo–O droplets. These droplets mediate the growth of MoS2 ribbons in the ‘crawling mode’ when saturated with sulfur. The locally well-defined orientations of the ribbons reveal the regular horizontal motion of the droplets during growth. Using atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and second harmonic generation microscopy, we show that the ribbons are grown homoepitaxially on monolayer MoS2 with predominantly 2H- or 3R-type stacking. Our findings highlight the prospects for the controlled growth of atomically thin nanostructure arrays for nanoelectronic devices and the development of unique mixed-dimensional structures."
538,Hole trap formation in polymer light-emitting diodes under current stress,2018-04-16,"Polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) are attractive for use in large-area displays and lighting panels, but their limited stability under current stress impedes commercialization. In spite of large efforts over the last two decades a fundamental understanding of the degradation mechanisms has not been accomplished. Here we demonstrate that the voltage drift of a PLED driven at constant current is caused by the formation of hole traps, which leads to additional non-radiative recombination between free electrons and trapped holes. The observed trap formation rate is consistent with exciton-free hole interactions as the main mechanism behind PLED degradation, enabling us to unify the degradation behaviour of various poly(p-phenylene) derivatives. The knowledge that hole trap formation is the cause of PLED degradation means that we can suppress the negative effect of hole traps on voltage and efficiency by blending the light-emitting polymer with a large-bandgap semiconductor. Owing to trap-dilution these blended PLEDs show unprecedented stability."
539,Pyroelectric energy conversion with large energy and power density in relaxor ferroelectric thin films,2018-04-16,"The need for efficient energy utilization is driving research into ways to harvest ubiquitous waste heat. Here, we explore pyroelectric energy conversion from low-grade thermal sources that exploits strong field- and temperature-induced polarization susceptibilities in the relaxor ferroelectric 0.68Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3–0.32PbTiO3. Electric-field-driven enhancement of the pyroelectric response (as large as −550 μC m−2 K−1) and suppression of the dielectric response (by 72%) yield substantial figures of merit for pyroelectric energy conversion. Field- and temperature-dependent pyroelectric measurements highlight the role of polarization rotation and field-induced polarization in mediating these effects. Solid-state, thin-film devices that convert low-grade heat into electrical energy are demonstrated using pyroelectric Ericsson cycles, and optimized to yield maximum energy density, power density and efficiency of 1.06 J cm−3, 526 W cm−3 and 19% of Carnot, respectively; the highest values reported to date and equivalent to the performance of a thermoelectric with an effective ZT ≈ 1.16 for a temperature change of 10 K. Our findings suggest that pyroelectric devices may be competitive with thermoelectric devices for low-grade thermal harvesting."
540,Highly reversible zinc metal anode for aqueous batteries,2018-04-16,"Metallic zinc (Zn) has been regarded as an ideal anode material for aqueous batteries because of its high theoretical capacity (820 mA h g–1), low potential (−0.762 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode), high abundance, low toxicity and intrinsic safety. However, aqueous Zn chemistry persistently suffers from irreversibility issues, as exemplified by its low coulombic efficiency (CE) and dendrite growth during plating/ stripping, and sustained water consumption. In this work, we demonstrate that an aqueous electrolyte based on Zn and lithium salts at high concentrations is a very effective way to address these issues. This unique electrolyte not only enables dendrite-free Zn plating/stripping at nearly 100% CE, but also retains water in the open atmosphere, which makes hermetic cell configurations optional. These merits bring unprecedented flexibility and reversibility to Zn batteries using either LiMn2O4 or O2 cathodes—the former deliver 180 W h kg–1 while retaining 80% capacity for >4,000 cycles, and the latter deliver 300 W h kg–1 (1,000 W h kg–1 based on the cathode) for >200 cycles."
541,Electrostrain in excess of 1% in polycrystalline piezoelectrics,2018-04-09,"Piezoelectric actuators transform electrical energy into mechanical energy, and because of their compactness, quick response time and accurate displacement, they are sought after in many applications. Polycrystalline piezoelectric ceramics are technologically more appealing than single crystals due to their simpler and less expensive processing, but have yet to display electrostrain values that exceed 1%. Here we report a material design strategy wherein the efficient switching of ferroelectric–ferroelastic domains by an electric field is exploited to achieve a high electrostrain value of 1.3% in a pseudo-ternary ferroelectric alloy system, BiFeO3–PbTiO3–LaFeO3. Detailed structural investigations reveal that this electrostrain is associated with a combination of several factors: a large spontaneous lattice strain of the piezoelectric phase, domain miniaturization, a low-symmetry ferroelectric phase and a very large reverse switching of the non-180° domains. This insight for the design of a new class of polycrystalline piezoceramics with high electrostrains may be useful to develop alternatives to costly single-crystal actuators."
542,Room-temperature ductile inorganic semiconductor,2018-04-09,"Ductility is common in metals and metal-based alloys, but is rarely observed in inorganic semiconductors and ceramic insulators. In particular, room-temperature ductile inorganic semiconductors were not known until now. Here, we report an inorganic α-Ag2S semiconductor that exhibits extraordinary metal-like ductility with high plastic deformation strains at room temperature. Analysis of the chemical bonding reveals systems of planes with relatively weak atomic interactions in the crystal structure. In combination with irregularly distributed silver–silver and sulfur–silver bonds due to the silver diffusion, they suppress the cleavage of the material, and thus result in unprecedented ductility. This work opens up the possibility of searching for ductile inorganic semiconductors/ceramics for flexible electronic devices."
543,Large local lattice expansion in graphene adlayers grown on copper,2018-04-09,"Variations of the lattice parameter can significantly change the properties of a material, and, in particular, its electronic behaviour. In the case of graphene, however, variations of the lattice constant with respect to graphite have been limited to less than 2.5% due to its well-established high in-plane stiffness. Here, through systematic electronic and lattice structure studies, we report regions where the lattice constant of graphene monolayers grown on copper by chemical vapour deposition increases up to ~7.5% of its relaxed value. Density functional theory calculations confirm that this expanded phase is energetically metastable and driven by the enhanced interaction between the substrate and the graphene adlayer. We also prove that this phase possesses distinctive chemical and electronic properties. The inherent phase complexity of graphene grown on copper foils revealed in this study may inspire the investigation of possible metastable phases in other seemingly simple heterostructure systems."
544,All-organic superhydrophobic coatings with mechanochemical robustness and liquid impalement resistance,2018-03-26,"Superhydrophobicity is a remarkable evolutionary adaption manifested by several natural surfaces. Artificial superhydrophobic coatings with good mechanical robustness, substrate adhesion and chemical robustness have been achieved separately. However, a simultaneous demonstration of these features along with resistance to liquid impalement via high-speed drop/jet impact is challenging. Here, we describe all-organic, flexible superhydrophobic nanocomposite coatings that demonstrate strong mechanical robustness under cyclic tape peels and Taber abrasion, sustain exposure to highly corrosive media, namely aqua regia and sodium hydroxide solutions, and can be applied to surfaces through scalable techniques such as spraying and brushing. In addition, the mechanical flexibility of our coatings enables impalement resistance to high-speed drops and turbulent jets at least up to ~35 m s−1 and a Weber number of ~43,000. With multifaceted robustness and scalability, these coatings should find potential usage in harsh chemical engineering as well as infrastructure, transport vehicles and communication equipment."
545,Large tunable photoeffect on ion conduction in halide perovskites and implications for photodecomposition,2018-03-19,"In the same way as electron transport is crucial for information technology, ion transport is a key phenomenon in the context of energy research. To be able to tune ion conduction by light would open up opportunities for a wide realm of new applications, but it has been challenging to provide clear evidence for such an effect. Here we show through various techniques, such as transference-number measurements, permeation studies, stoichiometric variations, Hall effect experiments and the use of blocking electrodes, that light excitation enhances by several orders of magnitude the ionic conductivity of methylammonium lead iodide, the archetypal metal halide photovoltaic material. We provide a rationale for this unexpected phenomenon and show that it straightforwardly leads to a hitherto unconsidered photodecomposition path of the perovskite."
546,Ultrahigh piezoelectricity in ferroelectric ceramics by design,2018-03-19,"Piezoelectric materials, which respond mechanically to applied electric field and vice versa, are essential for electromechanical transducers. Previous theoretical analyses have shown that high piezoelectricity in perovskite oxides is associated with a flat thermodynamic energy landscape connecting two or more ferroelectric phases. Here, guided by phenomenological theories and phase-field simulations, we propose an alternative design strategy to commonly used morphotropic phase boundaries to further flatten the energy landscape, by judiciously introducing local structural heterogeneity to manipulate interfacial energies (that is, extra interaction energies, such as electrostatic and elastic energies associated with the interfaces). To validate this, we synthesize rare-earth-doped Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3–PbTiO3 (PMN–PT), as rare-earth dopants tend to change the local structure of Pb-based perovskite ferroelectrics. We achieve ultrahigh piezoelectric coefficients d33 of up to 1,500 pC N−1 and dielectric permittivity ε33/ε0 above 13,000 in a Sm-doped PMN–PT ceramic with a Curie temperature of 89 °C. Our research provides a new paradigm for designing material properties through engineering local structural heterogeneity, expected to benefit a wide range of functional materials."
547,A molecular cross-linking approach for hybrid metal oxides,2018-03-05,"There is significant interest in the development of methods to create hybrid materials that transform capabilities, in particular for Earth-abundant metal oxides, such as TiO2, to give improved or new properties relevant to a broad spectrum of applications. Here we introduce an approach we refer to as ‘molecular cross-linking’, whereby a hybrid molecular boron oxide material is formed from polyhedral boron-cluster precursors of the type [B12(OH)12]2–. This new approach is enabled by the inherent robustness of the boron-cluster molecular building block, which is compatible with the harsh thermal and oxidizing conditions that are necessary for the synthesis of many metal oxides. In this work, using a battery of experimental techniques and materials simulation, we show how this material can be interfaced successfully with TiO2 and other metal oxides to give boron-rich hybrid materials with intriguing photophysical and electrochemical properties."
548,Acoustically modulated magnetic resonance imaging of gas-filled protein nanostructures,2018-02-26,"Non-invasive biological imaging requires materials capable of interacting with deeply penetrant forms of energy such as magnetic fields and sound waves. Here, we show that gas vesicles (GVs), a unique class of gas-filled protein nanostructures with differential magnetic susceptibility relative to water, can produce robust contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at sub-nanomolar concentrations, and that this contrast can be inactivated with ultrasound in situ to enable background-free imaging. We demonstrate this capability in vitro, in cells expressing these nanostructures as genetically encoded reporters, and in three model in vivo scenarios. Genetic variants of GVs, differing in their magnetic or mechanical phenotypes, allow multiplexed imaging using parametric MRI and differential acoustic sensitivity. Additionally, clustering-induced changes in MRI contrast enable the design of dynamic molecular sensors. By coupling the complementary physics of MRI and ultrasound, this nanomaterial gives rise to a distinct modality for molecular imaging with unique advantages and capabilities."
549,Insight into doping efficiency of organic semiconductors from the analysis of the density of states in n-doped C,2018-02-26,"Doping plays a crucial role in semiconductor physics, with n-doping being controlled by the ionization energy of the impurity relative to the conduction band edge. In organic semiconductors, efficient doping is dominated by various effects that are currently not well understood. Here, we simulate and experimentally measure, with direct and inverse photoemission spectroscopy, the density of states and the Fermi level position of the prototypical materials C60 and zinc phthalocyanine n-doped with highly efficient benzimidazoline radicals (2-Cyc-DMBI). We study the role of doping-induced gap states, and, in particular, of the difference Δ1 between the electron affinity of the undoped material and the ionization potential of its doped counterpart. We show that this parameter is critical for the generation of free carriers and influences the conductivity of the doped films. Tuning of Δ1 may provide alternative strategies to optimize the electronic properties of organic semiconductors."
550,Imaging the atomic structure and local chemistry of platelets in natural type Ia diamond,2018-02-21,"In the past decades, many efforts have been devoted to characterizing {001} platelet defects in type Ia diamond. It is known that N is concentrated at the defect core. However, an accurate description of the atomic structure of the defect and the role that N plays in it is still unknown. Here, by using aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy we have determined the atomic arrangement within platelet defects in a natural type Ia diamond and matched it to a prevalent theoretical model. The platelet has an anisotropic atomic structure with a zigzag ordering of defect pairs along the defect line. The electron energy-loss near-edge fine structure of both carbon K- and nitrogen K-edges obtained from the platelet core is consistent with a trigonal bonding arrangement at interstitial sites. The experimental observations support an interstitial aggregate mode of formation for platelet defects in natural diamond."
551,Universal strategy for Ohmic hole injection into organic semiconductors with high ionization energies,2018-02-19,"Barrier-free (Ohmic) contacts are a key requirement for efficient organic optoelectronic devices, such as organic light-emitting diodes, solar cells, and field-effect transistors. Here, we propose a simple and robust way of forming an Ohmic hole contact on organic semiconductors with a high ionization energy (IE). The injected hole current from high-work-function metal-oxide electrodes is improved by more than an order of magnitude by using an interlayer for which the sole requirement is that it has a higher IE than the organic semiconductor. Insertion of the interlayer results in electrostatic decoupling of the electrode from the semiconductor and realignment of the Fermi level with the IE of the organic semiconductor. The Ohmic-contact formation is illustrated for a number of material combinations and solves the problem of hole injection into organic semiconductors with a high IE of up to 6 eV."
552,X-ray electron density investigation of chemical bonding in van der Waals materials,2018-02-12,"Van der Waals (vdW) solids have attracted great attention ever since the discovery of graphene, with the essential feature being the weak chemical bonding across the vdW gap. The nature of these weak interactions is decisive for many extraordinary properties, but it is a strong challenge for current theory to accurately model long-range electron correlations. Here we use synchrotron X-ray diffraction data to precisely determine the electron density in the archetypal vdW solid, TiS2, and compare the results with density functional theory calculations. Quantitative agreement is observed for the chemical bonding description in the covalent TiS2 slabs, but significant differences are identified for the interactions across the gap, with experiment revealing more electron deformation than theory. The present data provide an experimental benchmark for testing theoretical models of weak chemical bonding."
553,Correlation of surface site formation to nanoisland growth in the electrochemical roughening of Pt(111),2018-02-12,"Platinum plays a central role in a variety of electrochemical devices and its practical use depends on the prevention of electrode degradation. However, understanding the underlying atomic processes under conditions of repeated oxidation and reduction inducing irreversible surface structure changes has proved challenging. Here, we examine the correlation between the evolution of the electrochemical signal of Pt(111) and its surface roughening by simultaneously performing cyclic voltammetry and in situ electrochemical scanning tunnelling microscopy (EC-STM). We identify a ‘nucleation and early growth’ regime of nanoisland formation, and a ‘late growth’ regime after island coalescence, which continues up to at least 170 cycles. The correlation analysis shows that each step site that is created in the ‘late growth’ regime contributes equally strongly to both the electrochemical and the roughness evolution. In contrast, in the ‘nucleation and early growth’ regime, created step sites contribute to the roughness, but not to the electrochemical signal."
554,Mixed matrix formulations with MOF molecular sieving for key energy-intensive separations,2018-02-12,"Membrane-based separations can improve energy efficiency and reduce the environmental impacts associated with traditional approaches. Nevertheless, many challenges must be overcome to design membranes that can replace conventional gas separation processes. Here, we report on the incorporation of engineered submicrometre-sized metal-organic framework (MOF) crystals into polymers to form hybrid materials that successfully translate the excellent molecular sieving properties of face-centred cubic (fcu)-MOFs into the resultant membranes. We demonstrate, simultaneously, exceptionally enhanced separation performance in hybrid membranes for two challenging and economically important applications: the removal of CO2 and H2S from natural gas and the separation of butane isomers. Notably, the membrane molecular sieving properties demonstrate that the deliberately regulated and contracted MOF pore-aperture size can discriminate between molecular pairs. The improved performance results from precise control of the linkers delimiting the triangular window, which is the sole entrance to the fcu-MOF pore. This rational-design hybrid approach provides a general toolbox for enhancing the transport properties of advanced membranes bearing molecular sieve fillers with sub-nanometre-sized pore-apertures."
555,Selective layer-free blood serum ionogram based on ion-specific interactions with a nanotransistor,2018-02-05,"Despite being ubiquitous in the fields of chemistry and biology, the ion-specific effects of electrolytes pose major challenges for researchers. A lack of understanding about ion-specific surface interactions has hampered the development and application of materials for (bio-)chemical sensor applications. Here, we show that scaling a silicon nanotransistor sensor down to ~25 nm provides a unique opportunity to understand and exploit ion-specific surface interactions, yielding a surface that is highly sensitive to cations and inert to pH. The unprecedented sensitivity of these devices to Na+ and divalent ions can be attributed to an overscreening effect via molecular dynamics. The surface potential of multi-ion solutions is well described by the sum of the electrochemical potentials of each cation, enabling selective measurements of a target ion concentration without requiring a selective organic layer. We use these features to construct a blood serum ionogram for Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+, in an important step towards the development of a versatile, durable and mobile chemical or blood diagnostic tool."
556,Quantitative self-assembly prediction yields targeted nanomedicines,2018-02-05,"Development of targeted nanoparticle drug carriers often requires complex synthetic schemes involving both supramolecular self-assembly and chemical modification. These processes are generally difficult to predict, execute, and control. We describe herein a targeted drug delivery system that is accurately and quantitatively predicted to self-assemble into nanoparticles based on the molecular structures of precursor molecules, which are the drugs themselves. The drugs assemble with the aid of sulfated indocyanines into particles with ultrahigh drug loadings of up to 90%. We devised quantitative structure-nanoparticle assembly prediction (QSNAP) models to identify and validate electrotopological molecular descriptors as highly predictive indicators of nano-assembly and nanoparticle size. The resulting nanoparticles selectively targeted kinase inhibitors to caveolin-1-expressing human colon cancer and autochthonous liver cancer models to yield striking therapeutic effects while avoiding pERK inhibition in healthy skin. This finding enables the computational design of nanomedicines based on quantitative models for drug payload selection."
557,"Quantitative relations between interaction parameter, miscibility and function in organic solar cells",2018-02-05,"Although it is known that molecular interactions govern morphology formation and purity of mixed domains of conjugated polymer donors and small-molecule acceptors, and thus largely control the achievable performance of organic solar cells, quantifying interaction–function relations has remained elusive. Here, we first determine the temperature-dependent effective amorphous–amorphous interaction parameter, χaa(T), by mapping out the phase diagram of a model amorphous polymer:fullerene material system. We then establish a quantitative ‘constant-kink-saturation’ relation between χaa and the fill factor in organic solar cells that is verified in detail in a model system and delineated across numerous high- and low-performing materials systems, including fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors. Our experimental and computational data reveal that a high fill factor is obtained only when χaa is large enough to lead to strong phase separation. Our work outlines a basis for using various miscibility tests and future simulation methods that will significantly reduce or eliminate trial-and-error approaches to material synthesis and device fabrication of functional semiconducting blends and organic blends in general."
558,Morphable 3D mesostructures and microelectronic devices by multistable buckling mechanics,2018-01-29,"Three-dimensional (3D) structures capable of reversible transformations in their geometrical layouts have important applications across a broad range of areas. Most morphable 3D systems rely on concepts inspired by origami/kirigami or techniques of 3D printing with responsive materials. The development of schemes that can simultaneously apply across a wide range of size scales and with classes of advanced materials found in state-of-the-art microsystem technologies remains challenging. Here, we introduce a set of concepts for morphable 3D mesostructures in diverse materials and fully formed planar devices spanning length scales from micrometres to millimetres. The approaches rely on elastomer platforms deformed in different time sequences to elastically alter the 3D geometries of supported mesostructures via nonlinear mechanical buckling. Over 20 examples have been experimentally and theoretically investigated, including mesostructures that can be reshaped between different geometries as well as those that can morph into three or more distinct states. An adaptive radiofrequency circuit and a concealable electromagnetic device provide examples of functionally reconfigurable microelectronic devices."
559,Thermochromic halide perovskite solar cells,2018-01-22,"Smart photovoltaic windows represent a promising green technology featuring tunable transparency and electrical power generation under external stimuli to control the light transmission and manage the solar energy. Here, we demonstrate a thermochromic solar cell for smart photovoltaic window applications utilizing the structural phase transitions in inorganic halide perovskite caesium lead iodide/bromide. The solar cells undergo thermally-driven, moisture-mediated reversible transitions between a transparent non-perovskite phase (81.7% visible transparency) with low power output and a deeply coloured perovskite phase (35.4% visible transparency) with high power output. The inorganic perovskites exhibit tunable colours and transparencies, a peak device efficiency above 7%, and a phase transition temperature as low as 105 °C. We demonstrate excellent device stability over repeated phase transition cycles without colour fade or performance degradation. The photovoltaic windows showing both photoactivity and thermochromic features represent key stepping-stones for integration with buildings, automobiles, information displays, and potentially many other technologies."
560,SiGe epitaxial memory for neuromorphic computing with reproducible high performance based on engineered dislocations,2018-01-22,"Although several types of architecture combining memory cells and transistors have been used to demonstrate artificial synaptic arrays, they usually present limited scalability and high power consumption. Transistor-free analog switching devices may overcome these limitations, yet the typical switching process they rely on—formation of filaments in an amorphous medium—is not easily controlled and hence hampers the spatial and temporal reproducibility of the performance. Here, we demonstrate analog resistive switching devices that possess desired characteristics for neuromorphic computing networks with minimal performance variations using a single-crystalline SiGe layer epitaxially grown on Si as a switching medium. Such epitaxial random access memories utilize threading dislocations in SiGe to confine metal filaments in a defined, one-dimensional channel. This confinement results in drastically enhanced switching uniformity and long retention/high endurance with a high analog on/off ratio. Simulations using the MNIST handwritten recognition data set prove that epitaxial random access memories can operate with an online learning accuracy of 95.1%."
561,Designing perturbative metamaterials from discrete models,2018-01-15,"Identifying material geometries that lead to metamaterials with desired functionalities presents a challenge for the field. Discrete, or reduced-order, models provide a concise description of complex phenomena, such as negative refraction, or topological surface states; therefore, the combination of geometric building blocks to replicate discrete models presenting the desired features represents a promising approach. However, there is no reliable way to solve such an inverse problem. Here, we introduce ‘perturbative metamaterials’, a class of metamaterials consisting of weakly interacting unit cells. The weak interaction allows us to associate each element of the discrete model with individual geometric features of the metamaterial, thereby enabling a systematic design process. We demonstrate our approach by designing two-dimensional elastic metamaterials that realize Veselago lenses, zero-dispersion bands and topological surface phonons. While our selected examples are within the mechanical domain, the same design principle can be applied to acoustic, thermal and photonic metamaterials composed of weakly interacting unit cells."
562,Exploiting the pliability and lateral mobility of Pickering emulsion for enhanced vaccination,2018-01-04,"A major challenge in vaccine formulations is the stimulation of both the humoral and cellular immune response for well-defined antigens with high efficacy and safety. Adjuvant research has focused on developing particulate carriers to model the sizes, shapes and compositions of microbes or diseased cells, but not antigen fluidity and pliability. Here, we develop Pickering emulsions—that is, particle-stabilized emulsions that retain the force-dependent deformability and lateral mobility of presented antigens while displaying high biosafety and antigen-loading capabilities. Compared with solid particles and conventional surfactant-stabilized emulsions, the optimized Pickering emulsions enhance the recruitment, antigen uptake and activation of antigen-presenting cells, potently stimulating both humoral and cellular adaptive responses, and thus increasing the survival of mice upon lethal challenge. The pliability and lateral mobility of antigen-loaded Pickering emulsions may provide a facile, effective, safe and broadly applicable strategy to enhance adaptive immunity against infections and diseases."
563,Broad-spectrum non-toxic antiviral nanoparticles with a virucidal inhibition mechanism,2017-12-18,"Viral infections kill millions yearly. Available antiviral drugs are virus-specific and active against a limited panel of human pathogens. There are broad-spectrum substances that prevent the first step of virus–cell interaction by mimicking heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), the highly conserved target of viral attachment ligands (VALs). The reversible binding mechanism prevents their use as a drug, because, upon dilution, the inhibition is lost. Known VALs are made of closely packed repeating units, but the aforementioned substances are able to bind only a few of them. We designed antiviral nanoparticles with long and flexible linkers mimicking HSPG, allowing for effective viral association with a binding that we simulate to be strong and multivalent to the VAL repeating units, generating forces (∼190 pN) that eventually lead to irreversible viral deformation. Virucidal assays, electron microscopy images, and molecular dynamics simulations support the proposed mechanism. These particles show no cytotoxicity, and in vitro nanomolar irreversible activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV), human papilloma virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), dengue and lenti virus. They are active ex vivo in human cervicovaginal histocultures infected by HSV-2 and in vivo in mice infected with RSV."
564,Safe and recyclable lithium-ion capacitors using sacrificial organic lithium salt,2017-12-11,"Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) shrewdly combine a lithium-ion battery negative electrode capable of reversibly intercalating lithium cations, namely graphite, together with an electrical double-layer positive electrode, namely activated carbon. However, the beauty of this concept is marred by the lack of a lithium-cation source in the device, thus requiring a specific preliminary charging step. The strategies devised thus far in an attempt to rectify this issue all present drawbacks. Our research uncovers a unique approach based on the use of a lithiated organic material, namely 3,4-dihydroxybenzonitrile dilithium salt. This compound can irreversibly provide lithium cations to the graphite electrode during an initial operando charging step without any negative effects with respect to further operation of the LIC. This method not only restores the low CO2 footprint of LICs, but also possesses far-reaching potential with respect to designing a wide range of greener hybrid devices based on other chemistries, comprising entirely recyclable components."
565,A sol–gel monolithic metal–organic framework with enhanced methane uptake,2017-12-11,"A critical bottleneck for the use of natural gas as a transportation fuel has been the development of materials capable of storing it in a sufficiently compact form at ambient temperature. Here we report the synthesis of a porous monolithic metal–organic framework (MOF), which after successful packing and densification reaches 259 cm3 (STP) cm−3 capacity. This is the highest value reported to date for conformed shape porous solids, and represents a greater than 50% improvement over any previously reported experimental value. Nanoindentation tests on the monolithic MOF showed robust mechanical properties, with hardness at least 130% greater than that previously measured in its conventional MOF counterparts. Our findings represent a substantial step in the application of mechanically robust conformed and densified MOFs for high volumetric energy storage and other industrial applications."
566,Isotope engineering of van der Waals interactions in hexagonal boron nitride,2017-12-11,"Hexagonal boron nitride is a model lamellar compound where weak, non-local van der Waals interactions ensure the vertical stacking of two-dimensional honeycomb lattices made of strongly bound boron and nitrogen atoms. We study the isotope engineering of lamellar compounds by synthesizing hexagonal boron nitride crystals with nearly pure boron isotopes (10B and 11B) compared to those with the natural distribution of boron (20 at% 10B and 80 at% 11B). On the one hand, as with standard semiconductors, both the phonon energy and electronic bandgap varied with the boron isotope mass, the latter due to the quantum effect of zero-point renormalization. On the other hand, temperature-dependent experiments focusing on the shear and breathing motions of adjacent layers revealed the specificity of isotope engineering in a layered material, with a modification of the van der Waals interactions upon isotope purification. The electron density distribution is more diffuse between adjacent layers in 10BN than in 11BN crystals. Our results open perspectives in understanding and controlling van der Waals bonding in layered materials."
567,Topological order and thermal equilibrium in polariton condensates,2017-12-04,"The Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless phase transition from a disordered to a quasi-ordered state, mediated by the proliferation of topological defects in two dimensions, governs seemingly remote physical systems ranging from liquid helium, ultracold atoms and superconducting thin films to ensembles of spins. Here we observe such a transition in a short-lived gas of exciton-polaritons, bosonic light–matter particles in semiconductor microcavities. The observed quasi-ordered phase, characteristic for an equilibrium two-dimensional bosonic gas, with a decay of coherence in both spatial and temporal domains with the same algebraic exponent, is reproduced with numerical solutions of stochastic dynamics, proving that the mechanism of pairing of the topological defects (vortices) is responsible for the transition to the algebraic order. This is made possible thanks to long polariton lifetimes in high-quality samples and in a reservoir-free region. Our results show that the joint measurement of coherence both in space and time is required to characterize driven–dissipative phase transitions and enable the investigation of topological ordering in open systems."
568,Control of piezoelectricity in amino acids by supramolecular packing,2017-12-04,"Piezoelectricity, the linear relationship between stress and induced electrical charge, has attracted recent interest due to its manifestation in biological molecules such as synthetic polypeptides or amino acid crystals, including gamma (γ) glycine. It has also been demonstrated in bone, collagen, elastin and the synthetic bone mineral hydroxyapatite. Piezoelectric coefficients exhibited by these biological materials are generally low, typically in the range of 0.1–10 pm V−1, limiting technological applications. Guided by quantum mechanical calculations we have measured a high shear piezoelectricity (178 pm V−1) in the amino acid crystal beta (β) glycine, which is of similar magnitude to barium titanate or lead zirconate titanate. Our calculations show that the high piezoelectric coefficients originate from an efficient packing of the molecules along certain crystallographic planes and directions. The highest predicted piezoelectric voltage constant for β-glycine crystals is 8 V mN−1, which is an order of magnitude larger than the voltage generated by any currently used ceramic or polymer."
569,Chiral liquid crystal colloids,2017-11-27,"Colloidal particles disturb the alignment of rod-like molecules of liquid crystals, giving rise to long-range interactions that minimize the free energy of distorted regions. Particle shape and topology are known to guide this self-assembly process. However, how chirality of colloidal inclusions affects these long-range interactions is unclear. Here we study the effects of distortions caused by chiral springs and helices on the colloidal self-organization in a nematic liquid crystal using laser tweezers, particle tracking and optical imaging. We show that chirality of colloidal particles interacts with the nematic elasticity to predefine chiral or racemic colloidal superstructures in nematic colloids. These findings are consistent with numerical modelling based on the minimization of Landau–de Gennes free energy. Our study uncovers the role of chirality in defining the mesoscopic order of liquid crystal colloids, suggesting that this feature may be a potential tool to modulate the global orientated self-organization of these systems."
570,Dislocation nucleation facilitated by atomic segregation,2017-11-27,"Surface segregation—the enrichment of one element at the surface, relative to the bulk—is ubiquitous to multi-component materials. Using the example of a Cu–Au solid solution, we demonstrate that compositional variations induced by surface segregation are accompanied by misfit strain and the formation of dislocations in the subsurface region via a surface diffusion and trapping process. The resulting chemically ordered surface regions acts as an effective barrier that inhibits subsequent dislocation annihilation at free surfaces. Using dynamic, atomic-scale resolution electron microscopy observations and theory modelling, we show that the dislocations are highly active, and we delineate the specific atomic-scale mechanisms associated with their nucleation, glide, climb, and annihilation at elevated temperatures. These observations provide mechanistic detail of how dislocations nucleate and migrate at heterointerfaces in dissimilar-material systems."
571,Ubiquitous formation of bulk Dirac cones and topological surface states from a single orbital manifold in transition-metal dichalcogenides,2017-11-27,"Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are renowned for their rich and varied bulk properties, while their single-layer variants have become one of the most prominent examples of two-dimensional materials beyond graphene. Their disparate ground states largely depend on transition metal d-electron-derived electronic states, on which the vast majority of attention has been concentrated to date. Here, we focus on the chalcogen-derived states. From density-functional theory calculations together with spin- and angle-resolved photoemission, we find that these generically host a co-existence of type-I and type-II three-dimensional bulk Dirac fermions as well as ladders of topological surface states and surface resonances. We demonstrate how these naturally arise within a single p-orbital manifold as a general consequence of a trigonal crystal field, and as such can be expected across a large number of compounds. Already, we demonstrate their existence in six separate TMDs, opening routes to tune, and ultimately exploit, their topological physics."
572,The development of bioresorbable composite polymeric implants with high mechanical strength,2017-11-20,"Implants for the treatment of tissue defects should mimic the mechanical properties of the native tissue of interest and should be resorbable as well as biocompatible. In this work, we developed a scaffold from variants of poly(glycolic) acid which were braided and coated with an elastomer of poly(glycolide-co-caprolactone) and crosslinked. The coating of the scaffold with the elastomer led to higher mechanical strength in terms of compression, expansion and elasticity compared to braids without the elastomer coating. These composite scaffolds were found to have expansion properties similar to metallic stents, utilizing materials which are typically much weaker than metal. We optimized the mechanical properties of the implant by tuning the elastomer branching structure, crosslink density, and molecular weight. The scaffolds were shown to be highly resorbable following implantation in a porcine femoral artery. Biocompatibility was studied in vivo in an ovine model by implanting the scaffolds into femoral arteries. The scaffolds were able to support an expanded open lumen over 12 months in vivo and also fully resorbed by 18 months in the ovine model."
573,Spontaneous exchange bias formation driven by a structural phase transition in the antiferromagnetic material,2017-11-20,"Most of the magnetic devices in advanced electronics rely on the exchange bias effect, a magnetic interaction that couples a ferromagnetic and an antiferromagnetic material, resulting in a unidirectional displacement of the ferromagnetic hysteresis loop by an amount called the ‘exchange bias field’. Setting and optimizing exchange bias involves cooling through the Néel temperature of the antiferromagnetic material in the presence of a magnetic field. Here we demonstrate an alternative process for the generation of exchange bias. In IrMn/FeCo bilayers, a structural phase transition in the IrMn layer develops at room temperature, exchange biasing the FeCo layer as it propagates. Once the process is completed, the IrMn layer contains very large single-crystal grains, with a large density of structural defects within each grain, which are promoted by the FeCo layer. The magnetic characterization indicates that these structural defects in the antiferromagnetic layer are behind the resulting large value of the exchange bias field and its good thermal stability. This mechanism for establishing the exchange bias in such a system can contribute towards the clarification of fundamental aspects of this exchange interaction."
574,Temporary formation of highly conducting domain walls for non-destructive read-out of ferroelectric domain-wall resistance switching memories,2017-11-20,"Erasable conductive domain walls in insulating ferroelectric thin films can be used for non-destructive electrical read-out of the polarization states in ferroelectric memories. Still, the domain-wall currents extracted by these devices have not yet reached the intensity and stability required to drive read-out circuits operating at high speeds. This study demonstrated non-destructive read-out of digital data stored using specific domain-wall configurations in epitaxial BiFeO3 thin films formed in mesa-geometry structures. Partially switched domains, which enable the formation of conductive walls during the read operation, spontaneously retract when the read voltage is removed, reducing the accumulation of mobile defects at the domain walls and potentially improving the device stability. Three-terminal memory devices produced 14 nA read currents at an operating voltage of 5 V, and operated up to T = 85 °C. The gap length can also be smaller than the film thickness, allowing the realization of ferroelectric memories with device dimensions far below 100 nm."
575,Optical gain in colloidal quantum dots achieved with direct-current electrical pumping,2017-11-20,"Chemically synthesized semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) can potentially enable solution-processable laser diodes with a wide range of operational wavelengths, yet demonstrations of lasing from the QDs are still at the laboratory stage. An important challenge—realization of lasing with electrical injection—remains unresolved, largely due to fast nonradiative Auger recombination of multicarrier states that represent gain-active species in the QDs. Here we present population inversion and optical gain in colloidal nanocrystals realized with direct-current electrical pumping. Using continuously graded QDs, we achieve a considerable suppression of Auger decay such that it can be outpaced by electrical injection. Further, we apply a special current-focusing device architecture, which allows us to produce high current densities (j) up to ∼18 A cm−2 without damaging either the QDs or the injection layers. The quantitative analysis of electroluminescence and current-modulated transmission spectra indicates that with j = 3–4 A cm−2 we achieve the population inversion of the band-edge states."
576,Programmed coherent coupling in a synthetic DNA-based excitonic circuit,2017-11-13,"Natural light-harvesting systems spatially organize densely packed chromophore aggregates using rigid protein scaffolds to achieve highly efficient, directed energy transfer. Here, we report a synthetic strategy using rigid DNA scaffolds to similarly program the spatial organization of densely packed, discrete clusters of cyanine dye aggregates with tunable absorption spectra and strongly coupled exciton dynamics present in natural light-harvesting systems. We first characterize the range of dye-aggregate sizes that can be templated spatially by A-tracts of B-form DNA while retaining coherent energy transfer. We then use structure-based modelling and quantum dynamics to guide the rational design of higher-order synthetic circuits consisting of multiple discrete dye aggregates within a DX-tile. These programmed circuits exhibit excitonic transport properties with prominent circular dichroism, superradiance, and fast delocalized exciton transfer, consistent with our quantum dynamics predictions. This bottom-up strategy offers a versatile approach to the rational design of strongly coupled excitonic circuits using spatially organized dye aggregates for use in coherent nanoscale energy transport, artificial light-harvesting, and nanophotonics."
577,Mechanotransduction-modulated fibrotic microniches reveal the contribution of angiogenesis in liver fibrosis,2017-11-13,"The role of pathological angiogenesis on liver fibrogenesis is still unknown. Here, we developed fibrotic microniches (FμNs) that recapitulate the interaction of liver sinusoid endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). We investigated how the mechanical properties of their substrates affect the formation of capillary-like structures and how they relate to the progression of angiogenesis during liver fibrosis. Differences in cell response in the FμNs were synonymous of the early and late stages of liver fibrosis. The stiffness of the early-stage FμNs was significantly elevated due to condensation of collagen fibrils induced by angiogenesis, and led to activation of HSCs by LSECs. We utilized these FμNs to understand the response to anti-angiogenic drugs, and it was evident that these drugs were effective only for early-stage liver fibrosis in vitro and in an in vivo mouse model of liver fibrosis. Late-stage liver fibrosis was not reversed following treatment with anti-angiogenic drugs but rather with inhibitors of collagen condensation. Our work reveals stage-specific angiogenesis-induced liver fibrogenesis via a previously unrevealed mechanotransduction mechanism which may offer precise intervention strategies targeting stage-specific disease progression."
578,Beating the thermodynamic limit with photo-activation of n-doping in organic semiconductors,2017-11-13,"Chemical doping of organic semiconductors using molecular dopants plays a key role in the fabrication of efficient organic electronic devices. Although a variety of stable molecular p-dopants have been developed and successfully deployed in devices in the past decade, air-stable molecular n-dopants suitable for materials with low electron affinity are still elusive. Here we demonstrate that photo-activation of a cleavable air-stable dimeric dopant can result in kinetically stable and efficient n-doping of host semiconductors, whose reduction potentials are beyond the thermodynamic reach of the dimer’s effective reducing strength. Electron-transport layers doped in this manner are used to fabricate high-efficiency organic light-emitting diodes. Our strategy thus enables a new paradigm for using air-stable molecular dopants to improve conductivity in, and provide ohmic contacts to, organic semiconductors with very low electron affinity."
579,Intracellular production of hydrogels and synthetic RNA granules by multivalent molecular interactions,2017-11-06,"Some protein components of intracellular non-membrane-bound entities, such as RNA granules, are known to form hydrogels in vitro. The physico-chemical properties and functional role of these intracellular hydrogels are difficult to study, primarily due to technical challenges in probing these materials in situ. Here, we present iPOLYMER, a strategy for a rapid induction of protein-based hydrogels inside living cells that explores the chemically inducible dimerization paradigm. Biochemical and biophysical characterizations aided by computational modelling show that the polymer network formed in the cytosol resembles a physiological hydrogel-like entity that acts as a size-dependent molecular sieve. We functionalize these polymers with RNA-binding motifs that sequester polyadenine-containing nucleotides to synthetically mimic RNA granules. These results show that iPOLYMER can be used to synthetically reconstitute the nucleation of biologically functional entities, including RNA granules in intact cells."
580,Fibronectin-bound α5β1 integrins sense load and signal to reinforce adhesion in less than a second,2017-11-06,"Integrin-mediated mechanosensing of the extracellular environment allows cells to control adhesion and signalling. Whether cells sense and respond to force immediately upon ligand-binding is unknown. Here, we report that during adhesion initiation, fibroblasts respond to mechanical load by strengthening integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin (FN) in a biphasic manner. In the first phase, which depends on talin and kindlin as well as on the actin nucleators Arp2/3 and mDia, FN-engaged α5β1 integrins activate focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and c-Src in less than 0.5 s to steeply strengthen α5β1- and αV-class integrin-mediated adhesion. When the mechanical load exceeds a certain threshold, fibroblasts decrease adhesion and initiate the second phase, which is characterized by less steep adhesion strengthening. This unique, biphasic cellular adhesion response is mediated by α5β1 integrins, which form catch bonds with FN and signal to FN-binding integrins to reinforce cell adhesion much before visible adhesion clusters are formed."
581,Maintenance of neural progenitor cell stemness in 3D hydrogels requires matrix remodelling,2017-10-30,"Neural progenitor cell (NPC) culture within three-dimensional (3D) hydrogels is an attractive strategy for expanding a therapeutically relevant number of stem cells. However, relatively little is known about how 3D material properties such as stiffness and degradability affect the maintenance of NPC stemness in the absence of differentiation factors. Over a physiologically relevant range of stiffness from ∼0.5 to 50 kPa, stemness maintenance did not correlate with initial hydrogel stiffness. In contrast, hydrogel degradation was both correlated with, and necessary for, maintenance of NPC stemness. This requirement for degradation was independent of cytoskeletal tension generation and presentation of engineered adhesive ligands, instead relying on matrix remodelling to facilitate cadherin-mediated cell–cell contact and promote β-catenin signalling. In two additional hydrogel systems, permitting NPC-mediated matrix remodelling proved to be a generalizable strategy for stemness maintenance in 3D. Our findings have identified matrix remodelling, in the absence of cytoskeletal tension generation, as a previously unknown strategy to maintain stemness in 3D."
582,Additively manufactured hierarchical stainless steels with high strength and ductility,2017-10-30,"Many traditional approaches for strengthening steels typically come at the expense of useful ductility, a dilemma known as strength–ductility trade-off. New metallurgical processing might offer the possibility of overcoming this. Here we report that austenitic 316L stainless steels additively manufactured via a laser powder-bed-fusion technique exhibit a combination of yield strength and tensile ductility that surpasses that of conventional 316L steels. High strength is attributed to solidification-enabled cellular structures, low-angle grain boundaries, and dislocations formed during manufacturing, while high uniform elongation correlates to a steady and progressive work-hardening mechanism regulated by a hierarchically heterogeneous microstructure, with length scales spanning nearly six orders of magnitude. In addition, solute segregation along cellular walls and low-angle grain boundaries can enhance dislocation pinning and promote twinning. This work demonstrates the potential of additive manufacturing to create alloys with unique microstructures and high performance for structural applications."
583,Robust resistive memory devices using solution-processable metal-coordinated azo aromatics,2017-10-23,"Non-volatile memories will play a decisive role in the next generation of digital technology. Flash memories are currently the key player in the field, yet they fail to meet the commercial demands of scalability and endurance. Resistive memory devices, and in particular memories based on low-cost, solution-processable and chemically tunable organic materials, are promising alternatives explored by the industry. However, to date, they have been lacking the performance and mechanistic understanding required for commercial translation. Here we report a resistive memory device based on a spin-coated active layer of a transition-metal complex, which shows high reproducibility (∼350 devices), fast switching (≤30 ns), excellent endurance (∼1012 cycles), stability (>106 s) and scalability (down to ∼60 nm2). In situ Raman and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy alongside spectroelectrochemistry and quantum chemical calculations demonstrate that the redox state of the ligands determines the switching states of the device whereas the counterions control the hysteresis. This insight may accelerate the technological deployment of organic resistive memories."
584,Sequential bottom-up assembly of mechanically stabilized synthetic cells by microfluidics,2017-10-16,"Compartments for the spatially and temporally controlled assembly of biological processes are essential towards cellular life. Synthetic mimics of cellular compartments based on lipid-based protocells lack the mechanical and chemical stability to allow their manipulation into a complex and fully functional synthetic cell. Here, we present a high-throughput microfluidic method to generate stable, defined sized liposomes termed ‘droplet-stabilized giant unilamellar vesicles (dsGUVs)’. The enhanced stability of dsGUVs enables the sequential loading of these compartments with biomolecules, namely purified transmembrane and cytoskeleton proteins by microfluidic pico-injection technology. This constitutes an experimental demonstration of a successful bottom-up assembly of a compartment with contents that would not self-assemble to full functionality when simply mixed together. Following assembly, the stabilizing oil phase and droplet shells are removed to release functional self-supporting protocells to an aqueous phase, enabling them to interact with physiologically relevant matrices."
585,Continuous-wave infrared optical gain and amplified spontaneous emission at ultralow threshold by colloidal HgTe quantum dots,2017-10-09,"Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) raise more and more interest as solution-processable and tunable optical gain materials. However, especially for infrared active QDs, optical gain remains inefficient. Since stimulated emission involves multifold degenerate band-edge states, population inversion can be attained only at high pump power and must compete with efficient multi-exciton recombination. Here, we show that mercury telluride (HgTe) QDs exhibit size-tunable stimulated emission throughout the near-infrared telecom window at thresholds unmatched by any QD studied before. We attribute this unique behaviour to surface-localized states in the bandgap that turn HgTe QDs into 4-level systems. The resulting long-lived population inversion induces amplified spontaneous emission under continuous-wave optical pumping at power levels compatible with solar irradiation and direct current electrical pumping. These results introduce an alternative approach for low-threshold QD-based gain media based on intentional trap states that paves the way for solution-processed infrared QD lasers and amplifiers."
586,Liquid metal–organic frameworks,2017-10-09,"Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a family of chemically diverse materials, with applications in a wide range of fields, covering engineering, physics, chemistry, biology and medicine. Until recently, research has focused almost entirely on crystalline structures, yet now a clear trend is emerging, shifting the emphasis onto disordered states, including ‘defective by design’ crystals, as well as amorphous phases such as glasses and gels. Here we introduce a strongly associated MOF liquid, obtained by melting a zeolitic imidazolate framework. We combine in situ variable temperature X-ray, ex situ neutron pair distribution function experiments, and first-principles molecular dynamics simulations to study the melting phenomenon and the nature of the liquid obtained. We demonstrate from structural, dynamical, and thermodynamical information that the chemical configuration, coordinative bonding, and porosity of the parent crystalline framework survive upon formation of the MOF liquid."
587,Circulating tumour DNA methylation markers for diagnosis and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma,2017-10-09,"An effective blood-based method for the diagnosis and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not yet been developed. Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) carrying cancer-specific genetic and epigenetic aberrations may enable a noninvasive ‘liquid biopsy’ for diagnosis and monitoring of cancer. Here, we identified an HCC-specific methylation marker panel by comparing HCC tissue and normal blood leukocytes and showed that methylation profiles of HCC tumour DNA and matched plasma ctDNA are highly correlated. Using cfDNA samples from a large cohort of 1,098 HCC patients and 835 normal controls, we constructed a diagnostic prediction model that showed high diagnostic specificity and sensitivity (P < 0.001) and was highly correlated with tumour burden, treatment response, and stage. Additionally, we constructed a prognostic prediction model that effectively predicted prognosis and survival (P < 0.001). Together, these findings demonstrate in a large clinical cohort the utility of ctDNA methylation markers in the diagnosis, surveillance, and prognosis of HCC."
588,Mechanical confinement regulates cartilage matrix formation by chondrocytes,2017-10-02,"Cartilage tissue equivalents formed from hydrogels containing chondrocytes could provide a solution for replacing damaged cartilage. Previous approaches have often utilized elastic hydrogels. However, elastic stresses may restrict cartilage matrix formation and alter the chondrocyte phenotype. Here we investigated the use of viscoelastic hydrogels, in which stresses are relaxed over time and which exhibit creep, for three-dimensional (3D) culture of chondrocytes. We found that faster relaxation promoted a striking increase in the volume of interconnected cartilage matrix formed by chondrocytes. In slower relaxing gels, restriction of cell volume expansion by elastic stresses led to increased secretion of IL-1β, which in turn drove strong up-regulation of genes associated with cartilage degradation and cell death. As no cell-adhesion ligands are presented by the hydrogels, these results reveal cell sensing of cell volume confinement as an adhesion-independent mechanism of mechanotransduction in 3D culture, and highlight stress relaxation as a key design parameter for cartilage tissue engineering."
589,Realizing the classical ,2017-09-25,"The vast majority of real-life optimization problems with a large number of degrees of freedom are intractable by classical computers, since their complexity grows exponentially fast with the number of variables. Many of these problems can be mapped into classical spin models, such as the Ising, the XY or the Heisenberg models, so that optimization problems are reduced to finding the global minimum of spin models. Here, we propose and investigate the potential of polariton graphs as an efficient analogue simulator for finding the global minimum of the XY model. By imprinting polariton condensate lattices of bespoke geometries we show that we can engineer various coupling strengths between the lattice sites and read out the result of the global minimization through the relative phases. Besides solving optimization problems, polariton graphs can simulate a large variety of systems undergoing the U(1) symmetry-breaking transition. We realize various magnetic phases, such as ferromagnetic, anti-ferromagnetic, and frustrated spin configurations on a linear chain, the unit cells of square and triangular lattices, a disordered graph, and demonstrate the potential for size scalability on an extended square lattice of 45 coherently coupled polariton condensates. Our results provide a route to study unconventional superfluids, spin liquids, Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless phase transition, and classical magnetism, among the many systems that are described by the XY Hamiltonian."
590,Imaging and tuning polarity at SrTiO,2017-09-18,"Electrostatic fields tune the ground state of interfaces between complex oxide materials. Electronic properties, such as conductivity and superconductivity, can be tuned and then used to create and control circuit elements and gate-defined devices. Here we show that naturally occurring twin boundaries, with properties that are different from their surrounding bulk, can tune the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface 2DEG at the nanoscale. In particular, SrTiO3 domain boundaries have the unusual distinction of remaining highly mobile down to low temperatures, and were recently suggested to be polar. Here we apply localized pressure to an individual SrTiO3 twin boundary and detect a change in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface current distribution. Our data directly confirm the existence of polarity at the twin boundaries, and demonstrate that they can serve as effective tunable gates. As the location of SrTiO3 domain walls can be controlled using external field stimuli, our findings suggest a novel approach to manipulate SrTiO3-based devices on the nanoscale."
591,Resolving ultrafast exciton migration in organic solids at the nanoscale,2017-09-18,"Effectiveness of molecular-based light harvesting relies on transport of excitons to charge-transfer sites. Measuring exciton migration, however, has been challenging because of the mismatch between nanoscale migration lengths and the diffraction limit. Instead of using bulk substrate quenching methods, here we define quenching boundaries all-optically with sub-diffraction resolution, thus characterizing spatiotemporal exciton migration on its native nanometre and picosecond scales. By transforming stimulated emission depletion microscopy into a time-resolved ultrafast approach, we measure a 16-nm migration length in poly(2,5-di(hexyloxy)cyanoterephthalylidene) conjugated polymer films. Combined with Monte Carlo exciton hopping simulations, we show that migration in these films is essentially diffusive because intrinsic chromophore energetic disorder is comparable to chromophore inhomogeneous broadening. Our approach will enable previously unattainable correlation of local material structure to exciton migration character, applicable not only to photovoltaic or display-destined organic semiconductors but also to explaining the quintessential exciton migration exhibited in photosynthesis."
592,Partial breaking of the Coulombic ordering of ionic liquids confined in carbon nanopores,2017-09-18,"Ionic liquids are composed of equal quantities of positive and negative ions. In the bulk, electrical neutrality occurs in these liquids due to Coulombic ordering, in which ion shells of alternating charge form around a central ion. Their structure under confinement is far less well understood. This hinders the widespread application of ionic liquids in technological applications. Here we use scattering experiments to resolve the structure of a widely used ionic liquid (EMI–TFSI) when it is confined inside nanoporous carbons. We show that Coulombic ordering reduces when the pores can accommodate only a single layer of ions. Instead, equally charged ion pairs are formed due to the induction of an electric potential of opposite sign in the carbon pore walls. This non-Coulombic ordering is further enhanced in the presence of an applied external electric potential. This finding opens the door for the design of better materials for electrochemical applications."
593,Reversible magnesium and aluminium ions insertion in cation-deficient anatase TiO,2017-09-18,"In contrast to monovalent lithium or sodium ions, the reversible insertion of multivalent ions such as Mg2+ and Al3+ into electrode materials remains an elusive goal. Here, we demonstrate a new strategy to achieve reversible Mg2+ and Al3+ insertion in anatase TiO2, achieved through aliovalent doping, to introduce a large number of titanium vacancies that act as intercalation sites. We present a broad range of experimental and theoretical characterizations that show a preferential insertion of multivalent ions into titanium vacancies, allowing a much greater capacity to be obtained compared to pure TiO2. This result highlights the possibility to use the chemistry of defects to unlock the electrochemical activity of known materials, providing a new strategy for the chemical design of materials for practical multivalent batteries."
594,A map of high-mobility molecular semiconductors,2017-09-11,"The charge mobility of molecular semiconductors is limited by the large fluctuation of intermolecular transfer integrals, often referred to as off-diagonal dynamic disorder, which causes transient localization of the carriers’ eigenstates. Using a recently developed theoretical framework, we show here that the electronic structure of the molecular crystals determines its sensitivity to intermolecular fluctuations. We build a map of the transient localization lengths of high-mobility molecular semiconductors to identify what patterns of nearest-neighbour transfer integrals in the two-dimensional (2D) high-mobility plane protect the semiconductor from the effect of dynamic disorder and yield larger mobility. Such a map helps rationalizing the transport properties of the whole family of molecular semiconductors and is also used to demonstrate why common textbook approaches fail in describing this important class of materials. These results can be used to rapidly screen many compounds and design new ones with optimal transport characteristics."
595,Electrotunable nanoplasmonic liquid mirror,2017-09-11,"Recently, there has been a drive to design and develop fully tunable metamaterials for applications ranging from new classes of sensors to superlenses among others. Although advances have been made, tuning and modulating the optical properties in real time remains a challenge. We report on the first realization of a reversible electrotunable liquid mirror based on voltage-controlled self-assembly/disassembly of 16 nm plasmonic nanoparticles at the interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions. We show that optical properties such as reflectivity and spectral position of the absorption band can be varied in situ within ±0.5 V. This observed effect is in excellent agreement with theoretical calculations corresponding to the change in average interparticle spacing. This electrochemical fully tunable nanoplasmonic platform can be switched from a highly reflective ‘mirror’ to a transmissive ‘window’ and back again. This study opens a route towards realization of such platforms in future micro/nanoscale electrochemical cells, enabling the creation of tunable plasmonic metamaterials."
596,Long-lived force patterns and deformation waves at repulsive epithelial boundaries,2017-09-11,"For an organism to develop and maintain homeostasis, cell types with distinct functions must often be separated by physical boundaries. The formation and maintenance of such boundaries are commonly attributed to mechanisms restricted to the cells lining the boundary. Here we show that, besides these local subcellular mechanisms, the formation and maintenance of tissue boundaries involves long-lived, long-ranged mechanical events. Following contact between two epithelial monolayers expressing, respectively, EphB2 and its ligand ephrinB1, both monolayers exhibit oscillatory patterns of traction forces and intercellular stresses that tend to pull cell–matrix adhesions away from the boundary. With time, monolayers jam, accompanied by the emergence of deformation waves that propagate away from the boundary. This phenomenon is not specific to EphB2/ephrinB1 repulsion but is also present during the formation of boundaries with an inert interface and during fusion of homotypic epithelial layers. Our findings thus unveil a global physical mechanism that sustains tissue separation independently of the biochemical and mechanical features of the local tissue boundary."
597,Nanodiffusion in electrocatalytic films,2017-08-21,"In the active interest aroused by electrochemical reactions’ catalysis, related to modern energy challenges, films deposited on electrodes are often preferred to homogeneous catalysts. A particularly promising variety of such films, in terms of efficiency and selectivity, is offered by sprinkling catalytic nanoparticles onto a conductive network. Coupled with the catalytic reaction, the competitive occurrence of various modes of substrate diffusion—diffusion toward nanoparticles (‘nanodiffusion’) against film linear diffusion and solution linear diffusion—is analysed theoretically. It is governed by a dimensionless parameter that contains all the experimental factors, thus allowing one to single out the conditions in which nanodiffusion is the dominant mode of mass transport. These theoretical predictions are illustrated experimentally by proton reduction on a mixture of platinum nanoparticles and carbon dispersed in a Nafion film deposited on a glassy carbon electrode. The density of nanoparticles and the scan rate are used as experimental variables to test the theory."
598,The processing and heterostructuring of silk with light,2017-08-14,"Spider silk is a tough, elastic and lightweight biomaterial, although there is a lack of tools available for non-invasive processing of silk structures. Here we show that nonlinear multiphoton interactions of silk with few-cycle femtosecond pulses allow the processing and heterostructuring of the material in ambient air. Two qualitatively different responses, bulging by multiphoton absorption and plasma-assisted ablation, are observed for low- and high-peak intensities, respectively. Plasma ablation allows us to make localized nanocuts, microrods, nanotips and periodic patterns with minimal damage while preserving molecular structure. The bulging regime facilitates confined bending and microwelding of silk with materials such as metal, glass and Kevlar with strengths comparable to pristine silk. Moreover, analysis of Raman bands of microwelded joints reveals that the polypeptide backbone remains intact while perturbing its weak hydrogen bonds. Using this approach, we fabricate silk-based functional topological microstructures, such as Mobiüs strips, chiral helices and silk-based sensors."
599,Flexible shape-memory scaffold for minimally invasive delivery of functional tissues,2017-08-14,"Despite great progress in engineering functional tissues for organ repair, including the heart, an invasive surgical approach is still required for their implantation. Here, we designed an elastic and microfabricated scaffold using a biodegradable polymer (poly(octamethylene maleate (anhydride) citrate)) for functional tissue delivery via injection. The scaffold’s shape memory was due to the microfabricated lattice design. Scaffolds and cardiac patches (1 cm × 1 cm) were delivered through an orifice as small as 1 mm, recovering their initial shape following injection without affecting cardiomyocyte viability and function. In a subcutaneous syngeneic rat model, injection of cardiac patches was equivalent to open surgery when comparing vascularization, macrophage recruitment and cell survival. The patches significantly improved cardiac function following myocardial infarction in a rat, compared with the untreated controls. Successful minimally invasive delivery of human cell-derived patches to the epicardium, aorta and liver in a large-animal (porcine) model was achieved."
600,Phase coexistence and electric-field control of toroidal order in oxide superlattices,2017-08-07,"Systems that exhibit phase competition, order parameter coexistence, and emergent order parameter topologies constitute a major part of modern condensed-matter physics. Here, by applying a range of characterization techniques, and simulations, we observe that in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices all of these effects can be found. By exploring superlattice period-, temperature- and field-dependent evolution of these structures, we observe several new features. First, it is possible to engineer phase coexistence mediated by a first-order phase transition between an emergent, low-temperature vortex phase with electric toroidal order and a high-temperature ferroelectric a1/a2 phase. At room temperature, the coexisting vortex and ferroelectric phases form a mesoscale, fibre-textured hierarchical superstructure. The vortex phase possesses an axial polarization, set by the net polarization of the surrounding ferroelectric domains, such that it possesses a multi-order-parameter state and belongs to a class of gyrotropic electrotoroidal compounds. Finally, application of electric fields to this mixed-phase system permits interconversion between the vortex and the ferroelectric phases concomitant with order-of-magnitude changes in piezoelectric and nonlinear optical responses. Our findings suggest new cross-coupled functionalities."
601,Nanostructured organic semiconductor films for molecular detection with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy,2017-08-07,"π-Conjugated organic semiconductors have been explored in several optoelectronic devices, yet their use in molecular detection as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)-active platforms is unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that SERS-active, superhydrophobic and ivy-like nanostructured films of a molecular semiconductor, α,ω-diperfluorohexylquaterthiophene (DFH-4T), can be easily fabricated by vapour deposition. DFH-4T films without any additional plasmonic layer exhibit unprecedented Raman signal enhancements up to 3.4 × 103 for the probe molecule methylene blue. The combination of quantum mechanical computations, comparative experiments with a fluorocarbon-free α,ω-dihexylquaterthiophene (DH-4T), and thin-film microstructural analysis demonstrates the fundamental roles of the π-conjugated core fluorocarbon substitution and the unique DFH-4T film morphology governing the SERS response. Furthermore, Raman signal enhancements up to ∼1010 and sub-zeptomole (<10−21 mole) analyte detection were accomplished by coating the DFH-4T films with a thin gold layer. Our results offer important guidance for the molecular design of SERS-active organic semiconductors and easily fabricable SERS platforms for ultrasensitive trace analysis."
602,Hydrogels with precisely controlled integrin activation dictate vascular patterning and permeability,2017-08-07,"Integrin binding to bioengineered hydrogel scaffolds is essential for tissue regrowth and regeneration, yet not all integrin binding can lead to tissue repair. Here, we show that through engineering hydrogel materials to promote α3/α5β1 integrin binding, we can promote the formation of a space-filling and mature vasculature compared with hydrogel materials that promote αvβ3 integrin binding. In vitro, α3/α5β1 scaffolds promoted endothelial cells to sprout and branch, forming organized extensive networks that eventually reached and anastomosed with neighbouring branches. In vivo, α3/α5β1 scaffolds delivering vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoted non-tortuous blood vessel formation and non-leaky blood vessels by 10 days post-stroke. In contrast, materials that promote αvβ3 integrin binding promoted endothelial sprout clumping in vitro and leaky vessels in vivo. This work shows that precisely controlled integrin activation from a biomaterial can be harnessed to direct therapeutic vessel regeneration and reduce VEGF-induced vascular permeability in vivo."
603,Polymer ultrapermeability from the inefficient packing of 2D chains,2017-07-31,"The promise of ultrapermeable polymers, such as poly(trimethylsilylpropyne) (PTMSP), for reducing the size and increasing the efficiency of membranes for gas separations remains unfulfilled due to their poor selectivity. We report an ultrapermeable polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-TMN-Trip) that is substantially more selective than PTMSP. From molecular simulations and experimental measurement we find that the inefficient packing of the two-dimensional (2D) chains of PIM-TMN-Trip generates a high concentration of both small (<0.7 nm) and large (0.7–1.0 nm) micropores, the former enhancing selectivity and the latter permeability. Gas permeability data for PIM-TMN-Trip surpass the 2008 Robeson upper bounds for O2/N2, H2/N2, CO2/N2, H2/CH4 and CO2/CH4, with the potential for biogas purification and carbon capture demonstrated for relevant gas mixtures. Comparisons between PIM-TMN-Trip and structurally similar polymers with three-dimensional (3D) contorted chains confirm that its additional intrinsic microporosity is generated from the awkward packing of its 2D polymer chains in a 3D amorphous solid. This strategy of shape-directed packing of chains of microporous polymers may be applied to other rigid polymers for gas separations."
604,Formation of porous crystals via viscoelastic phase separation,2017-07-31,"Viscoelastic phase separation of colloidal suspensions can be interrupted to form gels either by glass transition or by crystallization. With a new confocal microscopy protocol, we follow the entire kinetics of phase separation, from homogeneous phase to different arrested states. For the first time in experiments, our results unveil a novel crystallization pathway to sponge-like porous crystal structures. In the early stages, we show that nucleation requires a structural reorganization of the liquid phase, called stress-driven ageing. Once nucleation starts, we observe that crystallization follows three different routes: direct crystallization of the liquid phase, the Bergeron process, and Ostwald ripening. Nucleation starts inside the reorganized network, but crystals grow past it by direct condensation of the gas phase on their surface, driving liquid evaporation, and producing a network structure different from the original phase separation pattern. We argue that similar crystal-gel states can be formed in monatomic and molecular systems if the liquid phase is slow enough to induce viscoelastic phase separation, but fast enough to prevent immediate vitrification. This provides a novel pathway to form nanoporous crystals of metals and semiconductors without dealloying, which may be important for catalytic, optical, sensing, and filtration applications."
605,One-pot synthesis of silanol-free nanosized MFI zeolite,2017-07-31,"The synthesis of nanostructured zeolites enables modification of catalytically relevant properties such as effective surface area and diffusion path length. Nanostructured zeolites may be synthesized either in alkaline media, and so contain significant numbers of hydrophilic silanol groups, or in expensive and harmful fluoride-containing media. Here, we report and characterize, using a combination of experimental and theoretical techniques, the one-pot synthesis of silanol-free nanosized MFI-type zeolites by introducing atomically dispersed tungsten; this prevents silanol group occurrence by forming flexible W–O–Si bridges. These W–O–Si bonds are more stable than Si–O–Si in the all-silica MFI zeolite. Tungsten incorporation in nanosized MFI crystals also modifies other properties such as structural features, hydrophobicity and Lewis acidity. The effect of these is illustrated on the catalytic epoxidation of styrene and separation of CO2 and NO2. Silanol-free nanosized W-MFI zeolites open new perspectives for catalytic and separation applications."
606,A magnetic topological semimetal Sr,2017-07-24,"Weyl (WSMs) evolve from Dirac semimetals in the presence of broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) or space-inversion symmetry. The WSM phases in TaAs-class materials and photonic crystals are due to the loss of space-inversion symmetry. For TRS-breaking WSMs, despite numerous theoretical and experimental efforts, few examples have been reported. In this Article, we report a new type of magnetic semimetal Sr1−yMn1−zSb2 (y, z < 0.1) with nearly massless relativistic fermion behaviour (m∗ = 0.04 − 0.05m0, where m0 is the free-electron mass). This material exhibits a ferromagnetic order for 304 K < T < 565 K, but a canted antiferromagnetic order with a ferromagnetic component for T < 304 K. The combination of relativistic fermion behaviour and ferromagnetism in Sr1−yMn1−zSb2 offers a rare opportunity to investigate the interplay between relativistic fermions and spontaneous TRS breaking."
607,Tunable room-temperature magnetic skyrmions in Ir/Fe/Co/Pt multilayers,2017-07-17,"Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale topological spin structures offering great promise for next-generation information storage technologies. The recent discovery of sub-100-nm room-temperature (RT) skyrmions in several multilayer films has triggered vigorous efforts to modulate their physical properties for their use in devices. Here we present a tunable RT skyrmion platform based on multilayer stacks of Ir/Fe/Co/Pt, which we study using X-ray microscopy, magnetic force microscopy and Hall transport techniques. By varying the ferromagnetic layer composition, we can tailor the magnetic interactions governing skyrmion properties, thereby tuning their thermodynamic stability parameter by an order of magnitude. The skyrmions exhibit a smooth crossover between isolated (metastable) and disordered lattice configurations across samples, while their size and density can be tuned by factors of two and ten, respectively. We thus establish a platform for investigating functional sub-50-nm RT skyrmions, pointing towards the development of skyrmion-based memory devices."
608,Electrical pumping and tuning of exciton-polaritons in carbon nanotube microcavities,2017-07-17,"Exciton-polaritons are hybrid light–matter particles that form upon strong coupling of an excitonic transition to a cavity mode. As bosons, polaritons can form condensates with coherent laser-like emission. For organic materials, optically pumped condensation was achieved at room temperature but electrically pumped condensation remains elusive due to insufficient polariton densities. Here we combine the outstanding optical and electronic properties of purified, solution-processed semiconducting (6,5) single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in a microcavity-integrated light-emitting field-effect transistor to realize efficient electrical pumping of exciton-polaritons at room temperature with high current densities (>10 kA cm−2) and tunability in the near-infrared (1,060 nm to 1,530 nm). We demonstrate thermalization of SWCNT polaritons, exciton-polariton pumping rates ∼104 times higher than in current organic polariton devices, direct control over the coupling strength (Rabi splitting) via the applied gate voltage, and a tenfold enhancement of polaritonic over excitonic emission. This powerful material–device combination paves the way to carbon-based polariton emitters and possibly lasers."
609,Dynamic surface self-reconstruction is the key of highly active perovskite nano-electrocatalysts for water splitting,2017-07-17,"The growing need to store increasing amounts of renewable energy has recently triggered substantial R&D efforts towards efficient and stable water electrolysis technologies. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at the electrolyser anode is central to the development of a clean, reliable and emission-free hydrogen economy. The development of robust and highly active anode materials for OER is therefore a great challenge and has been the main focus of research. Among potential candidates, perovskites have emerged as promising OER electrocatalysts. In this study, by combining a scalable cutting-edge synthesis method with time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, we were able to capture the dynamic local electronic and geometric structure during realistic operando conditions for highly active OER perovskite nanocatalysts. Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ as nano-powder displays unique features that allow a dynamic self-reconstruction of the material’s surface during OER, that is, the growth of a self-assembled metal oxy(hydroxide) active layer. Therefore, besides showing outstanding performance at both the laboratory and industrial scale, we provide a fundamental understanding of the operando OER mechanism for highly active perovskite catalysts. This understanding significantly differs from design principles based on ex situ characterization techniques."
610,Excitation-wavelength-dependent small polaron trapping of photoexcited carriers in α-Fe,2017-07-10,"Small polaron formation is known to limit ground-state mobilities in metal oxide photocatalysts. However, the role of small polaron formation in the photoexcited state and how this affects the photoconversion efficiency has yet to be determined. Here, transient femtosecond extreme-ultraviolet measurements suggest that small polaron localization is responsible for the ultrafast trapping of photoexcited carriers in haematite (α-Fe2O3). Small polaron formation is evidenced by a sub-100 fs splitting of the Fe 3p core orbitals in the Fe M2,3 edge. The small polaron formation kinetics reproduces the triple-exponential relaxation frequently attributed to trap states. However, the measured spectral signature resembles only the spectral predictions of a small polaron and not the pre-edge features expected for mid-gap trap states. The small polaron formation probability, hopping radius and lifetime varies with excitation wavelength, decreasing with increasing energy in the t2g conduction band. The excitation-wavelength-dependent localization of carriers by small polaron formation is potentially a limiting factor in haematite’s photoconversion efficiency."
611,Revealing crystalline domains in a mollusc shell single-crystalline prism,2017-07-10,"Biomineralization integrates complex processes leading to an extraordinary diversity of calcareous biomineral crystalline architectures, in intriguing contrast with the consistent presence of a sub-micrometric granular structure. Hence, gaining access to the crystalline architecture at the mesoscale, that is, over a few granules, is key to building realistic biomineralization scenarios. Here we provide the nanoscale spatial arrangement of the crystalline structure within the ‘single-crystalline’ prisms of the prismatic layer of a Pinctada margaritifera shell, exploiting three-dimensional X-ray Bragg ptychography microscopy. We reveal the details of the mesocrystalline organization, evidencing a crystalline coherence extending over a few granules. We additionally prove the existence of larger iso-oriented crystalline domains, slightly misoriented with respect to each other, around one unique rotation axis, and whose shapes are correlated with iso-strain domains. The highlighted mesocrystalline properties support recent biomineralization models involving partial fusion of oriented nanoparticle assembly and/or liquid droplet precursors."
612,Dopant compensation in alloyed CH,2017-07-03,"Organic–inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) bring an unprecedented opportunity for radiation detection with their defect-tolerance nature, large mobility–lifetime product, and simple crystal growth from solution. Here we report a dopant compensation in alloyed OIHP single crystals to overcome limitations of device noise and charge collection, enabling γ-ray spectrum collection at room temperature. CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbCl3 are found to be p-type and n-type doped, respectively, whereas dopant-compensated CH3NH3PbBr2.94Cl0.06 alloy has over tenfold improved bulk resistivity of 3.6 × 109 Ω cm. Alloying also increases the hole mobility to 560 cm2 V−1 s−1, yielding a high mobility–lifetime product of 1.8 × 10−2 cm2 V−1. The use of a guard ring electrode in the detector reduces the crystal surface leakage current and device dark current. A distinguishable 137Cs energy spectrum with comparable or better resolution than standard scintillator detectors is collected under a small electric field of 1.8 V mm−1 at room temperature."
613,Emergence of an enslaved phononic bandgap in a non-equilibrium pseudo-crystal,2017-06-19,"Material systems that reside far from thermodynamic equilibrium have the potential to exhibit dynamic properties and behaviours resembling those of living organisms. Here we realize a non-equilibrium material characterized by a bandgap whose edge is enslaved to the wavelength of an external coherent drive. The structure dynamically self-assembles into an unconventional pseudo-crystal geometry that equally distributes momentum across elements. The emergent bandgap is bestowed with lifelike properties, such as the ability to self-heal to perturbations and adapt to sudden changes in the drive. We derive an exact analytical solution for both the spatial organization and the bandgap features, revealing the mechanism for enslavement. This work presents a framework for conceiving lifelike non-equilibrium materials and emphasizes the potential for the dynamic imprinting of material properties through external degrees of freedom."
614,Electrochemical strain microscopy probes morphology-induced variations in ion uptake and performance in organic electrochemical transistors,2017-06-19,"Ionic transport phenomena in organic semiconductor materials underpin emerging technologies ranging from bioelectronics to energy storage. The performance of these systems is affected by an interplay of film morphology, ionic transport and electronic transport that is unique to organic semiconductors yet poorly understood. Using in situ electrochemical strain microscopy (ESM), we demonstrate that we can directly probe local variations in ion transport in polymer devices by measuring subnanometre volumetric expansion due to ion uptake following electrochemical oxidation of the semiconductor. The ESM data show that poly(3-hexylthiophene) electrochemical devices exhibit voltage-dependent heterogeneous swelling consistent with device operation and electrochromism. Our data show that polymer semiconductors can simultaneously exhibit field-effect and electrochemical operation regimes, with the operation modality and its distribution varying locally as a function of nanoscale film morphology, ion concentration and potential. Importantly, we provide a direct test of structure–function relationships by correlating strain heterogeneity with local stiffness maps. These data indicate that nanoscale variations in ion uptake are associated with local changes in polymer packing that may impede ion transport to different extents within the same macroscopic film and can inform future materials optimization."
615,Universal quinone electrodes for long cycle life aqueous rechargeable batteries,2017-06-19,"Aqueous rechargeable batteries provide the safety, robustness, affordability, and environmental friendliness necessary for grid storage and electric vehicle operations, but their adoption is plagued by poor cycle life due to the structural and chemical instability of the anode materials. Here we report quinones as stable anode materials by exploiting their structurally stable ion-coordination charge storage mechanism and chemical inertness towards aqueous electrolytes. Upon rational selection/design of quinone structures, we demonstrate three systems that coupled with industrially established cathodes and electrolytes exhibit long cycle life (up to 3,000 cycles/3,500 h), fast kinetics (≥20C), high anode specific capacity (up to 200–395 mAh g−1), and several examples of state-of-the-art specific energy/energy density (up to 76–92 Wh kg−1/ 161–208 Wh l−1) for several operational pH values (−1 to 15), charge carrier species (H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+), temperature (−35 to 25 °C), and atmosphere (with/without O2), making them a universal anode approach for any aqueous battery technology."
616,The MOF-driven synthesis of supported palladium clusters with catalytic activity for carbene-mediated chemistry,2017-06-12,"The development of catalysts able to assist industrially important chemical processes is a topic of high importance. In view of the catalytic capabilities of small metal clusters, research efforts are being focused on the synthesis of novel catalysts bearing such active sites. Here we report a heterogeneous catalyst consisting of Pd4 clusters with mixed-valence 0/+1 oxidation states, stabilized and homogeneously organized within the walls of a metal–organic framework (MOF). The resulting solid catalyst outperforms state-of-the-art metal catalysts in carbene-mediated reactions of diazoacetates, with high yields (>90%) and turnover numbers (up to 100,000). In addition, the MOF-supported Pd4 clusters retain their catalytic activity in repeated batch and flow reactions (>20 cycles). Our findings demonstrate how this synthetic approach may now instruct the future design of heterogeneous catalysts with advantageous reaction capabilities for other important processes."
617,Phagocytosis-inspired behaviour in synthetic protocell communities of compartmentalized colloidal objects,2017-06-12,"The spontaneous assembly of micro-compartmentalized colloidal objects capable of controlled interactions offers a step towards rudimentary forms of collective behaviour in communities of artificial cell-like entities (synthetic protocells). Here we report a primitive form of artificial phagocytosis in a binary community of synthetic protocells in which multiple silica colloidosomes are selectively ingested by self-propelled magnetic Pickering emulsion (MPE) droplets comprising particle-free fatty acid-stabilized apertures. Engulfment of the colloidosomes enables selective delivery and release of water-soluble payloads, and can be coupled to enzyme activity within the MPE droplets. Our results highlight opportunities for the development of new materials based on consortia of colloidal objects, and provide a novel microscale engineering approach to inducing higher-order behaviour in mixed populations of synthetic protocells."
618,Tension stimulation drives tissue formation in scaffold-free systems,2017-06-12,"Scaffold-free systems have emerged as viable approaches for engineering load-bearing tissues. However, the tensile properties of engineered tissues have remained far below the values for native tissue. Here, by using self-assembled articular cartilage as a model to examine the effects of intermittent and continuous tension stimulation on tissue formation, we show that the application of tension alone, or in combination with matrix remodelling and synthesis agents, leads to neocartilage with tensile properties approaching those of native tissue. Implantation of tension-stimulated tissues results in neotissues that are morphologically reminiscent of native cartilage. We also show that tension stimulation can be translated to a human cell source to generate anisotropic human neocartilage with enhanced tensile properties. Tension stimulation, which results in nearly sixfold improvements in tensile properties over unstimulated controls, may allow the engineering of mechanically robust biological replacements of native tissue."
619,Charge-transfer dynamics and nonlocal dielectric permittivity tuned with metamaterial structures as solvent analogues,2017-06-05,"Charge transfer (CT) is a fundamental and ubiquitous mechanism in biology, physics and chemistry. Here, we evidence that CT dynamics can be altered by multi-layered hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) substrates. Taking triphenylene:perylene diimide dyad supramolecular self-assemblies as a model system, we reveal longer-lived CT states in the presence of HMM structures, with both charge separation and recombination characteristic times increased by factors of 2.4 and 1.7—that is, relative variations of 140 and 73%, respectively. To rationalize these experimental results in terms of driving force, we successfully introduce image dipole interactions in Marcus theory. The non-local effect herein demonstrated is directly linked to the number of metal–dielectric pairs, can be formalized in the dielectric permittivity, and is presented as a solid analogue to local solvent polarity effects. This model and extra PH3T:PC60BM results show the generality of this non-local phenomenon and that a wide range of kinetic tailoring opportunities can arise from substrate engineering. This work paves the way toward the design of artificial substrates to control CT dynamics of interest for applications in optoelectronics and chemistry."
620,Cast aluminium single crystals cross the threshold from bulk to size-dependent stochastic plasticity,2017-05-29,"Metals are known to exhibit mechanical behaviour at the nanoscale different to bulk samples. This transition typically initiates at the micrometre scale, yet existing techniques to produce micrometre-sized samples often introduce artefacts that can influence deformation mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate the casting of micrometre-scale aluminium single-crystal wires by infiltration of a salt mould. Samples have millimetre lengths, smooth surfaces, a range of crystallographic orientations, and a diameter D as small as 6 μm. The wires deform in bursts, at a stress that increases with decreasing D. Bursts greater than 200 nm account for roughly 50% of wire deformation and have exponentially distributed intensities. Dislocation dynamics simulations show that single-arm sources that produce large displacement bursts halted by stochastic cross-slip and lock formation explain microcast wire behaviour. This microcasting technique may be extended to several other metals or alloys and offers the possibility of exploring mechanical behaviour spanning the micrometre scale."
621,Molecular engineering of chiral colloidal liquid crystals using DNA origami,2017-05-22,"Establishing precise control over the shape and the interactions of the microscopic building blocks is essential for design of macroscopic soft materials with novel structural, optical and mechanical properties. Here, we demonstrate robust assembly of DNA origami filaments into cholesteric liquid crystals, one-dimensional supramolecular twisted ribbons and two-dimensional colloidal membranes. The exquisite control afforded by the DNA origami technology establishes a quantitative relationship between the microscopic filament structure and the macroscopic cholesteric pitch. Furthermore, it also enables robust assembly of one-dimensional twisted ribbons, which behave as effective supramolecular polymers whose structure and elastic properties can be precisely tuned by controlling the geometry of the elemental building blocks. Our results demonstrate the potential synergy between DNA origami technology and colloidal science, in which the former allows for rapid and robust synthesis of complex particles, and the latter can be used to assemble such particles into bulk materials."
622,Printable elastic conductors by ,2017-05-15,"Printable elastic conductors promise large-area stretchable sensor/actuator networks for healthcare, wearables and robotics. Elastomers with metal nanoparticles are one of the best approaches to achieve high performance, but large-area utilization is limited by difficulties in their processability. Here we report a printable elastic conductor containing Ag nanoparticles that are formed in situ, solely by mixing micrometre-sized Ag flakes, fluorine rubbers, and surfactant. Our printable elastic composites exhibit conductivity higher than 4,000 S cm−1 (highest value: 6,168 S cm−1) at 0% strain, and 935 S cm−1 when stretched up to 400%. Ag nanoparticle formation is influenced by the surfactant, heating processes, and elastomer molecular weight, resulting in a drastic improvement of conductivity. Fully printed sensor networks for stretchable robots are demonstrated, sensing pressure and temperature accurately, even when stretched over 250%."
623,Dynamic chemical expansion of thin-film non-stoichiometric oxides at extreme temperatures,2017-05-08,"Actuator operation in increasingly extreme and remote conditions requires materials that reliably sense and actuate at elevated temperatures, and over a range of gas environments. Design of such materials will rely on high-temperature, high-resolution approaches for characterizing material actuation in situ. Here, we demonstrate a novel type of high-temperature, low-voltage electromechanical oxide actuator based on the model material PrxCe1−xO2−δ (PCO). Chemical strain and interfacial stress resulted from electrochemically pumping oxygen into or out of PCO films, leading to measurable film volume changes due to chemical expansion. At 650 °C, nanometre-scale displacement and strain of >0.1% were achieved with electrical bias values <0.1 V, low compared to piezoelectrically driven actuators, with strain amplified fivefold by stress-induced structural deflection. This operando measurement of films ‘breathing’ at second-scale temporal resolution also enabled detailed identification of the controlling kinetics of this response, and can be extended to other electrochemomechanically coupled oxide films at extreme temperatures."
624,Electron crystallography for determining the handedness of a chiral zeolite nanocrystal,2017-05-01,"Chiral crystals can be exploited for applications in enantioselective separation and catalysis. However, the study of chirality at the atomic level in a sub-micrometre-sized crystal is difficult due to the lack of adequate characterization methods. Herein, we present two efficient and practical methods of characterization that are based on electron crystallography. These methods are successfully applied to reveal the handedness of a chiral, zeolite nanocrystal. The handedness is identified through either a comparison of two high-resolution transmission electron microscope images, taken from the same nanocrystal but along different zone axes by tilting it around its screw axis, or the intensity asymmetry of a Bijvoet pair of reflections in a single precession electron-diffraction pattern. These two approaches provide new ways to determine the handedness of small, chiral crystals."
625,Synthesis of Ti,2017-05-01,"The large class of layered ceramics encompasses both van der Waals (vdW) and non-vdW solids. While intercalation of noble metals in vdW solids is known, formation of compounds by incorporation of noble-metal layers in non-vdW layered solids is largely unexplored. Here, we show formation of Ti3AuC2 and Ti3Au2C2 phases with up to 31% lattice swelling by a substitutional solid-state reaction of Au into Ti3SiC2 single-crystal thin films with simultaneous out-diffusion of Si. Ti3IrC2 is subsequently produced by a substitution reaction of Ir for Au in Ti3Au2C2. These phases form Ohmic electrical contacts to SiC and remain stable after 1,000 h of ageing at 600 °C in air. The present results, by combined analytical electron microscopy and ab initio calculations, open avenues for processing of noble-metal-containing layered ceramics that have not been synthesized from elemental sources, along with tunable properties such as stable electrical contacts for high-temperature power electronics or gas sensors."
626,EGFR and HER2 activate rigidity sensing only on rigid matrices,2017-05-01,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) interacts with integrins during cell spreading and motility, but little is known about the role of EGFR in these mechanosensing processes. Here we show, using two different cell lines, that in serum- and EGF-free conditions, EGFR or HER2 activity increase spreading and rigidity-sensing contractions on rigid, but not soft, substrates. Contractions peak after 15–20 min, but diminish by tenfold after 4 h. Addition of EGF at that point increases spreading and contractions, but this can be blocked by myosin-II inhibition. We further show that EGFR and HER2 are activated through phosphorylation by Src family kinases (SFK). On soft surfaces, neither EGFR inhibition nor EGF stimulation have any effect on cell motility. Thus, EGFR or HER2 can catalyse rigidity sensing after associating with nascent adhesions under rigidity-dependent tension downstream of SFK activity. This has broad implications for the roles of EGFR and HER2 in the absence of EGF both for normal and cancerous growth."
627,Tuning crystallization pathways through sequence engineering of biomimetic polymers,2017-04-17,"Two-step nucleation pathways in which disordered, amorphous, or dense liquid states precede the appearance of crystalline phases have been reported for a wide range of materials, but the dynamics of such pathways are poorly understood. Moreover, whether these pathways are general features of crystallizing systems or a consequence of system-specific structural details that select for direct versus two-step processes is unknown. Using atomic force microscopy to directly observe crystallization of sequence-defined polymers, we show that crystallization pathways are indeed sequence dependent. When a short hydrophobic region is added to a sequence that directly forms crystalline particles, crystallization instead follows a two-step pathway that begins with the creation of disordered clusters of 10–20 molecules and is characterized by highly non-linear crystallization kinetics in which clusters transform into ordered structures that then enter the growth phase. The results shed new light on non-classical crystallization mechanisms and have implications for the design of self-assembling polymer systems."
628,An intrinsic growth instability in isotropic materials leads to quasi-two-dimensional nanoplatelets,2017-04-03,"Colloidal nanoplatelets are atomically flat, quasi-two-dimensional sheets of semiconductor that can exhibit efficient, spectrally pure fluorescence. Despite intense interest in their properties, the mechanism behind their highly anisotropic shape and precise atomic-scale thickness remains unclear, and even counter-intuitive for commonly studied nanoplatelets that arise from isotropic crystal structures (such as zincblende CdSe and lead halide perovskites). Here we show that an intrinsic instability in growth kinetics can lead to such highly anisotropic shapes. By combining experimental results on the synthesis of CdSe nanoplatelets with theory predicting enhanced growth on narrow surface facets, we develop a model that explains nanoplatelet formation as well as observed dependencies on time and temperature. Based on standard concepts of volume, surface and edge energies, the resulting growth instability criterion can be directly applied to other crystalline materials. Thus, knowledge of this previously unknown mechanism for controlling shape at the nanoscale can lead to broader libraries of quasi-two-dimensional materials."
629,Nanoscale capillary freezing of ionic liquids confined between metallic interfaces and the role of electronic screening,2017-03-27,"Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are new materials with fundamental importance for energy storage and active lubrication. They are unusual liquids, which challenge the classical frameworks of electrolytes, whose behaviour at electrified interfaces remains elusive, with exotic responses relevant to their electrochemical activity. Using tuning-fork-based atomic force microscope nanorheological measurements, we explore here the properties of confined RTILs, unveiling a dramatic change of the RTIL towards a solid-like phase below a threshold thickness, pointing to capillary freezing in confinement. This threshold is related to the metallic nature of the confining materials, with more metallic surfaces facilitating freezing. This behaviour is interpreted in terms of the shift of the freezing transition, taking into account the influence of the electronic screening on RTIL wetting of the confining surfaces. Our findings provide fresh views on the properties of confined RTIL with implications for their properties inside nanoporous metallic structures, and suggests applications to tune nanoscale lubrication with phase-changing RTILs, by varying the nature and patterning of the substrate, and application of active polarization."
630,Real-time impedance monitoring of oxygen reduction during surface modification of thin film cathodes,2017-03-27,"Improvement of solid oxide fuel cells strongly relies on the development of cathode materials with high catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction. Excellent activity was found for perovskite-type oxides such as La1−xSrxCoO3−δ (LSC), but performance degradation, probably caused by surface composition changes, hinders exploitation of the full potential of LSC. This study reveals that the potentially very high activity of the LSC surface can be traced back to few very active sites. Already tiny amounts of SrO, for example, 4% of a monolayer, deposited on an LSC surface, lead to severe deactivation. Co, on the other hand, causes (re-)activation, suggesting that active sites are strongly related to Co being present at the surface. These insights could be gained by a novel method to measure changes of the electrochemical performance of thin film electrodes in situ, while modifying their surface: impedance spectroscopy measurements during deposition of well-defined fractions of monolayers of Sr-, Co- and La-oxides by single laser pulses in a pulsed laser deposition chamber."
631,Functional electronic inversion layers at ferroelectric domain walls,2017-03-20,"Ferroelectric domain walls hold great promise as functional two-dimensional materials because of their unusual electronic properties. Particularly intriguing are the so-called charged walls where a polarity mismatch causes local, diverging electrostatic potentials requiring charge compensation and hence a change in the electronic structure. These walls can exhibit significantly enhanced conductivity and serve as a circuit path. The development of all-domain-wall devices, however, also requires walls with controllable output to emulate electronic nano-components such as diodes and transistors. Here we demonstrate electric-field control of the electronic transport at ferroelectric domain walls. We reversibly switch from resistive to conductive behaviour at charged walls in semiconducting ErMnO3. We relate the transition to the formation—and eventual activation—of an inversion layer that acts as the channel for the charge transport. The findings provide new insight into the domain-wall physics in ferroelectrics and foreshadow the possibility to design elementary digital devices for all-domain-wall circuitry."
632,Colony stimulating factor-1 receptor is a central component of the foreign body response to biomaterial implants in rodents and non-human primates,2017-03-20,"Host recognition and immune-mediated foreign body response to biomaterials can compromise the performance of implanted medical devices. To identify key cell and cytokine targets, here we perform in-depth systems analysis of innate and adaptive immune system responses to implanted biomaterials in rodents and non-human primates. While macrophages are indispensable to the fibrotic cascade, surprisingly neutrophils and complement are not. Macrophages, via CXCL13, lead to downstream B cell recruitment, which further potentiated fibrosis, as confirmed by B cell knockout and CXCL13 neutralization. Interestingly, colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) is significantly increased following implantation of multiple biomaterial classes: ceramic, polymer and hydrogel. Its inhibition, like macrophage depletion, leads to complete loss of fibrosis, but spares other macrophage functions such as wound healing, reactive oxygen species production and phagocytosis. Our results indicate that targeting CSF1R may allow for a more selective method of fibrosis inhibition, and improve biomaterial biocompatibility without the need for broad immunosuppression."
633,Photoelectrochemical water splitting in separate oxygen and hydrogen cells,2017-03-13,"Solar water splitting provides a promising path for sustainable hydrogen production and solar energy storage. One of the greatest challenges towards large-scale utilization of this technology is reducing the hydrogen production cost. The conventional electrolyser architecture, where hydrogen and oxygen are co-produced in the same cell, gives rise to critical challenges in photoelectrochemical water splitting cells that directly convert solar energy and water to hydrogen. Here we overcome these challenges by separating the hydrogen and oxygen cells. The ion exchange in our cells is mediated by auxiliary electrodes, and the cells are connected to each other only by metal wires, enabling centralized hydrogen production. We demonstrate hydrogen generation in separate cells with solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 7.5%, which can readily surpass 10% using standard commercial components. A basic cost comparison shows that our approach is competitive with conventional photoelectrochemical systems, enabling safe and potentially affordable solar hydrogen production."
634,Direct 3D mapping of the Fermi surface and Fermi velocity,2017-03-13,"We performed a full mapping of the bulk electronic structure including the Fermi surface and Fermi-velocity distribution vF(kF) of tungsten. The 4D spectral function ρ(EB; k) in the entire bulk Brillouin zone and 6 eV binding-energy (EB) interval was acquired in ∼3 h thanks to a new multidimensional photoemission data-recording technique (combining full-field k-microscopy with time-of-flight parallel energy recording) and the high brilliance of the soft X-rays used. A direct comparison of bulk and surface spectral functions (taken at low photon energies) reveals a time-reversal-invariant surface state in a local bandgap in the (110)-projected bulk band structure. The surface state connects hole and electron pockets that would otherwise be separated by an indirect local bandgap. We confirmed its Dirac-like spin texture by spin-filtered momentum imaging. The measured 4D data array enables extraction of the 3D dispersion of all bands, all energy isosurfaces, electron velocities, hole or electron conductivity, effective mass and inner potential by simple algorithms without approximations. The high-Z bcc metals with large spin–orbit-induced bandgaps are discussed as candidates for topologically non-trivial surface states."
635,Controlling the growth of multiple ordered heteromolecular phases by utilizing intermolecular repulsion,2017-03-13,"Metal/organic interfaces and their structural, electronic, spintronic and thermodynamic properties have been investigated intensively, aiming to improve and develop future electronic devices. In this context, heteromolecular phases add new design opportunities simply by combining different molecules. However, controlling the desired phases in such complex systems is a challenging task. Here, we report an effective way of steering the growth of a bimolecular system composed of adsorbate species with opposite intermolecular interactions—repulsive and attractive, respectively. The repulsive species forms a two-dimensional lattice gas, the density of which controls which crystalline phases are stable. Critical gas phase densities determine the constant-area phase diagram that describes our experimental observations, including eutectic regions with three coexisting phases. We anticipate the general validity of this type of phase diagram for binary systems containing two-dimensional gas phases, and also show that the density of the gas phase allows engineering of the interface structure."
636,A fully organic retinal prosthesis restores vision in a rat model of degenerative blindness,2017-03-06,"The degeneration of photoreceptors in the retina is one of the major causes of adult blindness in humans. Unfortunately, no effective clinical treatments exist for the majority of retinal degenerative disorders. Here we report on the fabrication and functional validation of a fully organic prosthesis for long-term in vivo subretinal implantation in the eye of Royal College of Surgeons rats, a widely recognized model of retinitis pigmentosa. Electrophysiological and behavioural analyses reveal a prosthesis-dependent recovery of light sensitivity and visual acuity that persists up to 6–10 months after surgery. The rescue of the visual function is accompanied by an increase in the basal metabolic activity of the primary visual cortex, as demonstrated by positron emission tomography imaging. Our results highlight the possibility of developing a new generation of fully organic, highly biocompatible and functionally autonomous photovoltaic prostheses for subretinal implants to treat degenerative blindness."
637,The microstructure and micromechanics of the tendon–bone insertion,2017-02-27,"The exceptional mechanical properties of the load-bearing connection of tendon to bone rely on an intricate interplay of its biomolecular composition, microstructure and micromechanics. Here we identify that the Achilles tendon–bone insertion is characterized by an interface region of ∼500 μm with a distinct fibre organization and biomolecular composition. Within this region, we identify a heterogeneous mechanical response by micromechanical testing coupled with multiscale confocal microscopy. This leads to localized strains that can be larger than the remotely applied strain. The subset of fibres that sustain the majority of loading in the interface area changes with the angle of force application. Proteomic analysis detects enrichment of 22 proteins in the interfacial region that are predominantly involved in cartilage and skeletal development as well as proteoglycan metabolism. The presented mechanisms mark a guideline for further biomimetic strategies to rationally design hard–soft interfaces."
638,Colloidal alloys with preassembled clusters and spheres,2017-02-27,"Self-assembly is a powerful approach for constructing colloidal crystals, where spheres, rods or faceted particles can build up a myriad of structures. Nevertheless, many complex or low-coordination architectures, such as diamond, pyrochlore and other sought-after lattices, have eluded self-assembly. Here we introduce a new design principle based on preassembled components of the desired superstructure and programmed nearest-neighbour DNA-mediated interactions, which allows the formation of otherwise unattainable structures. We demonstrate the approach using preassembled colloidal tetrahedra and spheres, obtaining a class of colloidal superstructures, including cubic and tetragonal colloidal crystals, with no known atomic analogues, as well as percolating low-coordination diamond and pyrochlore sublattices never assembled before."
639,Evidence for anionic redox activity in a tridimensional-ordered Li-rich positive electrode β-Li,2017-02-27,"Lithium-ion battery cathode materials have relied on cationic redox reactions until the recent discovery of anionic redox activity in Li-rich layered compounds which enables capacities as high as 300 mAh g−1. In the quest for new high-capacity electrodes with anionic redox, a still unanswered question was remaining regarding the importance of the structural dimensionality. The present manuscript provides an answer. We herein report on a β-Li2IrO3 phase which, in spite of having the Ir arranged in a tridimensional (3D) framework instead of the typical two-dimensional (2D) layers seen in other Li-rich oxides, can reversibly exchange 2.5 e− per Ir, the highest value ever reported for any insertion reaction involving d-metals. We show that such a large activity results from joint reversible cationic (Mn+) and anionic (O2)n− redox processes, the latter being visualized via complementary transmission electron microscopy and neutron diffraction experiments, and confirmed by density functional theory calculations. Moreover, β-Li2IrO3 presents a good cycling behaviour while showing neither cationic migration nor shearing of atomic layers as seen in 2D-layered Li-rich materials. Remarkably, the anionic redox process occurs jointly with the oxidation of Ir4+ at potentials as low as 3.4 V versus Li+/Li0, as equivalently observed in the layered α-Li2IrO3 polymorph. Theoretical calculations elucidate the electrochemical similarities and differences of the 3D versus 2D polymorphs in terms of structural, electronic and mechanical descriptors. Our findings free the structural dimensionality constraint and broaden the possibilities in designing high-energy-density electrodes for the next generation of Li-ion batteries."
640,Antifogging abilities of model nanotextures,2017-02-27,"Nanometre-scale features with special shapes impart a broad spectrum of unique properties to the surface of insects. These properties are essential for the animal’s survival, and include the low light reflectance of moth eyes, the oil repellency of springtail carapaces and the ultra-adhesive nature of palmtree bugs. Antireflective mosquito eyes and cicada wings are also known to exhibit some antifogging and self-cleaning properties. In all cases, the combination of small feature size and optimal shape provides exceptional surface properties. In this work, we investigate the underlying antifogging mechanism in model materials designed to mimic natural systems, and explain the importance of the texture’s feature size and shape. While exposure to fog strongly compromises the water-repellency of hydrophobic structures, this failure can be minimized by scaling the texture down to nanosize. This undesired effect even becomes non-measurable if the hydrophobic surface consists of nanocones, which generate antifogging efficiency close to unity and water departure of droplets smaller than 2 μm."
641,Visualizing excitations at buried heterojunctions in organic semiconductor blends,2017-02-20,"Interfaces play a crucial role in semiconductor devices, but in many device architectures they are nanostructured, disordered and buried away from the surface of the sample. Conventional optical, X-ray and photoelectron probes often fail to provide interface-specific information in such systems. Here we develop an all-optical time-resolved method to probe the local energetic landscape and electronic dynamics at such interfaces, based on the Stark effect caused by electron–hole pairs photo-generated across the interface. Using this method, we found that the electronically active sites at the polymer/fullerene interfaces in model bulk-heterojunction blends fall within the low-energy tail of the absorption spectrum. This suggests that these sites are highly ordered compared with the bulk of the polymer film, leading to large wavefunction delocalization and low site energies. We also detected a 100 fs migration of holes from higher- to lower-energy sites, consistent with these charges moving ballistically into more ordered polymer regions. This ultrafast charge motion may be key to separating electron–hole pairs into free charges against the Coulomb interaction."
642,Strong evidence for ,2017-02-13,"A d-orbital electron has an anisotropic electron orbital and is a source of magnetism. The realization of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) embedded at a LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface surprised researchers in materials and physical sciences because the 2DEG consists of 3d-electrons of Ti with extraordinarily large carrier mobility, even in the insulating oxide heterostructure. To date, a wide variety of physical phenomena, such as ferromagnetism and the quantum Hall effect, have been discovered in this 2DEG system, demonstrating the ability of d-electron 2DEG systems to provide a material platform for the study of interesting physics. However, because of both ferromagnetism and the Rashba field, long-range spin transport and the exploitation of spintronics functions have been believed difficult to implement in d-electron 2DEG systems. Here, we report the experimental demonstration of room-temperature spin transport in a d-electron-based 2DEG at a LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface, where the spin relaxation length is about 300 nm. Our finding, which counters the conventional understandings of d-electron 2DEGs, highlights the spin-functionality of conductive oxide systems and opens the field of d-electron spintronics."
643,A zero-thermal-quenching phosphor,2017-02-13,"Phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes (pc-WLEDs) are efficient light sources used in lighting, high-tech displays, and electronic devices. One of the most significant challenges of pc-WLEDs is the thermal quenching, in which the phosphor suffers from emission loss with increasing temperature during high-power LED operation. Here, we report a blue-emitting Na3–2xSc2(PO4)3:xEu2+ phosphor (λem = 453 nm) that does not exhibit thermal quenching even up to 200 °C. This phenomenon of zero thermal quenching originates from the ability of the phosphor to compensate the emission losses and therefore sustain the luminescence with increasing temperature. The findings are explained by polymorphic modification and possible energy transfer from electron–hole pairs at the thermally activated defect levels to the Eu2+ 5d-band with increasing temperature. Our results could initiate the exploration of phosphors with zero thermal quenching for high-power LED applications."
644,Endocytic reawakening of motility in jammed epithelia,2017-01-30,"Dynamics of epithelial monolayers has recently been interpreted in terms of a jamming or rigidity transition. How cells control such phase transitions is, however, unknown. Here we show that RAB5A, a key endocytic protein, is sufficient to induce large-scale, coordinated motility over tens of cells, and ballistic motion in otherwise kinetically arrested monolayers. This is linked to increased traction forces and to the extension of cell protrusions, which align with local velocity. Molecularly, impairing endocytosis, macropinocytosis or increasing fluid efflux abrogates RAB5A-induced collective motility. A simple model based on mechanical junctional tension and an active cell reorientation mechanism for the velocity of self-propelled cells identifies regimes of monolayer dynamics that explain endocytic reawakening of locomotion in terms of a combination of large-scale directed migration and local unjamming. These changes in multicellular dynamics enable collectives to migrate under physical constraints and may be exploited by tumours for interstitial dissemination."
645,Three-dimensional imaging of dislocation dynamics during the hydriding phase transformation,2017-01-16,"Crystallographic imperfections significantly alter material properties and their response to external stimuli, including solute-induced phase transformations. Despite recent progress in imaging defects using electron and X-ray techniques, in situ three-dimensional imaging of defect dynamics remains challenging. Here, we use Bragg coherent diffractive imaging to image defects during the hydriding phase transformation of palladium nanocrystals. During constant-pressure experiments we observe that the phase transformation begins after dislocation nucleation close to the phase boundary in particles larger than 300 nm. The three-dimensional phase morphology suggests that the hydrogen-rich phase is more similar to a spherical cap on the hydrogen-poor phase than to the core–shell model commonly assumed. We substantiate this using three-dimensional phase field modelling, demonstrating how phase morphology affects the critical size for dislocation nucleation. Our results reveal how particle size and phase morphology affects transformations in the PdH system."
646,Two-dimensional assemblies from crystallizable homopolymers with charged termini,2017-01-09,"The creation of shaped, uniform and colloidally stable two-dimensional (2D) assemblies by bottom-up methods represents a challenge of widespread current interest for a variety of applications. Herein, we describe the utilization of surface charge to stabilize self-assembled planar structures that are formed from crystallizable polymer precursors by a seeded growth approach. Addition of crystallizable homopolymers with charged end-groups to seeds generated by the sonication of block copolymer micelles with crystalline cores yields uniform platelet micelles with controlled dimensions. Significantly, the seeded growth approach is characterized by a morphological memory effect whereby the origin of the seed, which can involve a quasi-hexagonal or rectangular 2D platelet precursor, dictates the observed 2D platelet shape. This new strategy is illustrated using two different polymer systems, and opens the door to the construction of 2D hierarchical structures with broad utility."
647,Designer vaccine nanodiscs for personalized cancer immunotherapy,2016-12-26,"Despite the tremendous potential of peptide-based cancer vaccines, their efficacy has been limited in humans. Recent innovations in tumour exome sequencing have signalled the new era of personalized immunotherapy with patient-specific neoantigens, but a general methodology for stimulating strong CD8α+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses remains lacking. Here we demonstrate that high-density lipoprotein-mimicking nanodiscs coupled with antigen (Ag) peptides and adjuvants can markedly improve Ag/adjuvant co-delivery to lymphoid organs and sustain Ag presentation on dendritic cells. Strikingly, nanodiscs elicited up to 47-fold greater frequencies of neoantigen-specific CTLs than soluble vaccines and even 31-fold greater than perhaps the strongest adjuvant in clinical trials (that is, CpG in Montanide). Moreover, multi-epitope vaccination generated broad-spectrum T-cell responses that potently inhibited tumour growth. Nanodiscs eliminated established MC-38 and B16F10 tumours when combined with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy. These findings represent a new powerful approach for cancer immunotherapy and suggest a general strategy for personalized nanomedicine."
648,Hybrid metal–organic chalcogenide nanowires with electrically conductive inorganic core through diamondoid-directed assembly,2016-12-26,"Controlling inorganic structure and dimensionality through structure-directing agents is a versatile approach for new materials synthesis that has been used extensively for metal–organic frameworks and coordination polymers. However, the lack of ‘solid’ inorganic cores requires charge transport through single-atom chains and/or organic groups, limiting their electronic properties. Here, we report that strongly interacting diamondoid structure-directing agents guide the growth of hybrid metal–organic chalcogenide nanowires with solid inorganic cores having three-atom cross-sections, representing the smallest possible nanowires. The strong van der Waals attraction between diamondoids overcomes steric repulsion leading to a cis configuration at the active growth front, enabling face-on addition of precursors for nanowire elongation. These nanowires have band-like electronic properties, low effective carrier masses and three orders-of-magnitude conductivity modulation by hole doping. This discovery highlights a previously unexplored regime of structure-directing agents compared with traditional surfactant, block copolymer or metal–organic framework linkers."
649,Dynamic restructuring drives catalytic activity on nanoporous gold–silver alloy catalysts,2016-12-19,"Bimetallic, nanostructured materials hold promise for improving catalyst activity and selectivity, yet little is known about the dynamic compositional and structural changes that these systems undergo during pretreatment that leads to efficient catalyst function. Here we use ozone-activated silver–gold alloys in the form of nanoporous gold as a case study to demonstrate the dynamic behaviour of bimetallic systems during activation to produce a functioning catalyst. We show that it is these dynamic changes that give rise to the observed catalytic activity. Advanced in situ electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are used to demonstrate that major restructuring and compositional changes occur along the path to catalytic function for selective alcohol oxidation. Transient kinetic measurements correlate the restructuring to three types of oxygen on the surface. The direct influence of changes in surface silver concentration and restructuring at the nanoscale on oxidation activity is demonstrated. Our results demonstrate that characterization of these dynamic changes is necessary to unlock the full potential of bimetallic catalytic materials."
650,Static three-dimensional topological solitons in fluid chiral ferromagnets and colloids,2016-12-19,"Three-dimensional (3D) topological solitons are continuous but topologically nontrivial field configurations localized in 3D space and embedded in a uniform far-field background, that behave like particles and cannot be transformed to a uniform state through smooth deformations. Many topologically nontrivial 3D solitonic fields have been proposed. Yet, according to the Hobart–Derrick theorem, physical systems cannot host them, except for nonlinear theories with higher-order derivatives such as the Skyrme–Faddeev model. Experimental discovery of such solitons is hindered by the need for spatial imaging of the 3D fields, which is difficult in high-energy physics and cosmology. Here we experimentally realize and numerically model stationary topological solitons in a fluid chiral ferromagnet formed by colloidal dispersions of magnetic nanoplates. Such solitons have closed-loop preimages—3D regions with a single orientation of the magnetization field. We discuss localized structures with different linking of preimages quantified by topological Hopf invariants. The chirality is found to help in overcoming the constraints of the Hobart–Derrick theorem, like in two-dimensional ferromagnetic solitons, dubbed ‘baby skyrmions’. Our experimental platform may lead to solitonic condensed matter phases and technological applications."
651,Negating interfacial impedance in garnet-based solid-state Li metal batteries,2016-12-19,"Garnet-type solid-state electrolytes have attracted extensive attention due to their high ionic conductivity, approaching 1 mS cm−1, excellent environmental stability, and wide electrochemical stability window, from lithium metal to ∼6 V. However, to date, there has been little success in the development of high-performance solid-state batteries using these exceptional materials, the major challenge being the high solid–solid interfacial impedance between the garnet electrolyte and electrode materials. In this work, we effectively address the large interfacial impedance between a lithium metal anode and the garnet electrolyte using ultrathin aluminium oxide (Al2O3) by atomic layer deposition. Li7La2.75Ca0.25Zr1.75Nb0.25O12 (LLCZN) is the garnet composition of choice in this work due to its reduced sintering temperature and increased lithium ion conductivity. A significant decrease of interfacial impedance, from 1,710 Ω cm2 to 1 Ω cm2, was observed at room temperature, effectively negating the lithium metal/garnet interfacial impedance. Experimental and computational results reveal that the oxide coating enables wetting of metallic lithium in contact with the garnet electrolyte surface and the lithiated-alumina interface allows effective lithium ion transport between the lithium metal anode and garnet electrolyte. We also demonstrate a working cell with a lithium metal anode, garnet electrolyte and a high-voltage cathode by applying the newly developed interface chemistry."
652,Temporal mapping of photochemical reactions and molecular excited states with carbon specificity,2016-12-12,Photochemical reactions are essential to a large number of important industrial and biological processes. A method for monitoring photochemical reaction kinetics and the dynamics of molecular excitations with spatial resolution within the active molecule would allow a rigorous exploration of the pathway and mechanism of photophysical and photochemical processes. Here we demonstrate that laser-excited muon pump–probe spin spectroscopy (photo-μSR) can temporally and spatially map these processes with a spatial resolution at the single-carbon level in a molecule with a pentacene backbone. The observed time-dependent light-induced changes of an avoided level crossing resonance demonstrate that the photochemical reactivity of a specific carbon atom is modified as a result of the presence of the excited state wavefunction. This demonstrates the sensitivity and potential of this technique in probing molecular excitations and photochemistry.
653,High operational and environmental stability of high-mobility conjugated polymer field-effect transistors through the use of molecular additives,2016-12-12,"Due to their low-temperature processing properties and inherent mechanical flexibility, conjugated polymer field-effect transistors (FETs) are promising candidates for enabling flexible electronic circuits and displays. Much progress has been made on materials performance; however, there remain significant concerns about operational and environmental stability, particularly in the context of applications that require a very high level of threshold voltage stability, such as active-matrix addressing of organic light-emitting diode displays. Here, we investigate the physical mechanisms behind operational and environmental degradation of high-mobility, p-type polymer FETs and demonstrate an effective route to improve device stability. We show that water incorporated in nanometre-sized voids within the polymer microstructure is the key factor in charge trapping and device degradation. By inserting molecular additives that displace water from these voids, it is possible to increase the stability as well as uniformity to a high level sufficient for demanding industrial applications."
654,Engineering dissipation with phononic spectral hole burning,2016-12-12,"Optomechanics, nano-electromechanics, and integrated photonics have brought about a renaissance in phononic device physics and technology. Central to this advance are devices and materials supporting ultra-long-lived photonic and phononic excitations that enable novel regimes of classical and quantum dynamics based on tailorable photon–phonon coupling. Silica-based devices have been at the forefront of such innovations for their ability to support optical excitations persisting for nearly 1 billion cycles, and for their low optical nonlinearity. While acoustic phonon modes can persist for a similar number of cycles in crystalline solids at cryogenic temperatures, it has not been possible to achieve such performance in silica, as silica becomes acoustically opaque at low temperatures. We demonstrate that these intrinsic forms of phonon dissipation are greatly reduced (by >90%) by nonlinear saturation using continuous drive fields of disparate frequencies. The result is a form of steady-state phononic spectral hole burning that produces a wideband transparency window with optically generated phonon fields of modest (nW) powers. We developed a simple model that explains both dissipative and dispersive changes produced by phononic saturation. Our studies, conducted in a microscale device, represent an important step towards engineerable phonon dynamics on demand and the use of glasses as low-loss phononic media."
655,Topologically protected bound states in photonic parity–time-symmetric crystals,2016-12-05,"Parity–time (PT)-symmetric crystals are a class of non-Hermitian systems that allow, for example, the existence of modes with real propagation constants, for self-orthogonality of propagating modes, and for uni-directional invisibility at defects. Photonic PT-symmetric systems that also support topological states could be useful for shaping and routing light waves. However, it is currently debated whether topological interface states can exist at all in PT-symmetric systems. Here, we show theoretically and demonstrate experimentally the existence of such states: states that are localized at the interface between two topologically distinct PT-symmetric photonic lattices. We find analytical closed form solutions of topological PT-symmetric interface states, and observe them through fluorescence microscopy in a passive PT-symmetric dimerized photonic lattice. Our results are relevant towards approaches to localize light on the interface between non-Hermitian crystals."
656,Centimetre-scale micropore alignment in oriented polycrystalline metal–organic framework films via heteroepitaxial growth,2016-12-05,"The fabrication of oriented, crystalline films of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) is a critical step toward their application to advanced technologies such as optics, microelectronics, microfluidics and sensing. However, the direct synthesis of MOF films with controlled crystalline orientation remains a significant challenge. Here we report a one-step approach, carried out under mild conditions, that exploits heteroepitaxial growth for the rapid fabrication of oriented polycrystalline MOF films on the centimetre scale. Our methodology employs crystalline copper hydroxide as a substrate and yields MOF films with oriented pore channels on scales that primarily depend on the dimensions of the substrate. To demonstrate that an anisotropic crystalline morphology can translate to a functional property, we assembled a centimetre-scale MOF film in the presence of a dye and showed that the optical response could be switched ‘ON’ or ‘OFF’ by simply rotating the film."
657,Oxygen vacancies enhance pseudocapacitive charge storage properties of MoO,2016-12-05,"The short charging times and high power capabilities associated with capacitive energy storage make this approach an attractive alternative to batteries. One limitation of electrochemical capacitors is their low energy density and for this reason, there is widespread interest in pseudocapacitive materials that use Faradaic reactions to store charge. One candidate pseudocapacitive material is orthorhombic MoO3 (α-MoO3), a layered compound with a high theoretical capacity for lithium (279 mA h g−1 or 1,005 C g−1). Here, we report on the properties of reduced α-MoO3−x(R-MoO3−x) and compare it with fully oxidized α-MoO3 (F-MoO3). The introduction of oxygen vacancies leads to a larger interlayer spacing that promotes faster charge storage kinetics and enables the α-MoO3 structure to be retained during the insertion and removal of Li ions. The higher specific capacity of the R-MoO3−x is attributed to the reversible formation of a significant amount of Mo4+ following lithiation. This study underscores the potential importance of incorporating oxygen vacancies into transition metal oxides as a strategy for increasing the charge storage kinetics of redox-active materials."
658,Solution-based electrical doping of semiconducting polymer films over a limited depth,2016-12-05,"Solution-based electrical doping protocols may allow more versatility in the design of organic electronic devices; yet, controlling the diffusion of dopants in organic semiconductors and their stability has proven challenging. Here we present a solution-based approach for electrical p-doping of films of donor conjugated organic semiconductors and their blends with acceptors over a limited depth with a decay constant of 10–20 nm by post-process immersion into a polyoxometalate solution (phosphomolybdic acid, PMA) in nitromethane. PMA-doped films show increased electrical conductivity and work function, reduced solubility in the processing solvent, and improved photo-oxidative stability in air. This approach is applicable to a variety of organic semiconductors used in photovoltaics and field-effect transistors. PMA doping over a limited depth of bulk heterojunction polymeric films, in which amine-containing polymers were mixed in the solution used for film formation, enables single-layer organic photovoltaic devices, processed at room temperature, with power conversion efficiencies up to 5.9 ± 0.2% and stable performance on shelf-lifetime studies at 60 °C for at least 280 h."
659,Biredox ionic liquids with solid-like redox density in the liquid state for high-energy supercapacitors,2016-11-28,"Kinetics of electrochemical reactions are several orders of magnitude slower in solids than in liquids as a result of the much lower ion diffusivity. Yet, the solid state maximizes the density of redox species, which is at least two orders of magnitude lower in liquids because of solubility limitations. With regard to electrochemical energy storage devices, this leads to high-energy batteries with limited power and high-power supercapacitors with a well-known energy deficiency. For such devices the ideal system should endow the liquid state with a density of redox species close to the solid state. Here we report an approach based on biredox ionic liquids to achieve bulk-like redox density at liquid-like fast kinetics. The cation and anion of these biredox ionic liquids bear moieties that undergo very fast reversible redox reactions. As a first demonstration of their potential for high-capacity/high-rate charge storage, we used them in redox supercapacitors. These ionic liquids are able to decouple charge storage from an ion-accessible electrode surface, by storing significant charge in the pores of the electrodes, to minimize self-discharge and leakage current as a result of retaining the redox species in the pores, and to raise working voltage due to their wide electrochemical window."
660,Slip-activated surface creep with room-temperature super-elongation in metallic nanocrystals,2016-11-28,"Nanoscale metallic crystals have been shown to follow a ‘smaller is stronger’ trend. However, they usually suffer from low ductility due to premature plastic instability by source-limited crystal slip. Here, by performing in situ atomic-scale transmission electron microscopy, we report unusual room-temperature super-elongation without softening in face-centred-cubic silver nanocrystals, where crystal slip serves as a stimulus to surface diffusional creep. This interplay mechanism is shown experimentally and theoretically to govern the plastic deformation of nanocrystals over a material-dependent sample diameter range between the lower and upper limits for nanocrystal stability by surface diffusional creep and dislocation plasticity, respectively, which extends far beyond the maximum size for pure diffusion-mediated deformation (for example, Coble-type creep). This work provides insight into the atomic-scale coupled diffusive–displacive deformation mechanisms, maximizing ductility and strength simultaneously in nanoscale materials."
661,Current-induced switching in a magnetic insulator,2016-11-21,"The spin Hall effect in heavy metals converts charge current into pure spin current, which can be injected into an adjacent ferromagnet to exert a torque. This spin–orbit torque (SOT) has been widely used to manipulate the magnetization in metallic ferromagnets. In the case of magnetic insulators (MIs), although charge currents cannot flow, spin currents can propagate, but current-induced control of the magnetization in a MI has so far remained elusive. Here we demonstrate spin-current-induced switching of a perpendicularly magnetized thulium iron garnet film driven by charge current in a Pt overlayer. We estimate a relatively large spin-mixing conductance and damping-like SOT through spin Hall magnetoresistance and harmonic Hall measurements, respectively, indicating considerable spin transparency at the Pt/MI interface. We show that spin currents injected across this interface lead to deterministic magnetization reversal at low current densities, paving the road towards ultralow-dissipation spintronic devices based on MIs."
662,Entropic contributions enhance polarity compensation for CeO,2016-11-21,"Surface structure controls the physical and chemical response of materials. Surface polar terminations are appealing because of their unusual properties but they are intrinsically unstable. Several mechanisms, namely metallization, adsorption, and ordered reconstructions, can remove thermodynamic penalties rendering polar surfaces partially stable. Here, for CeO2(100), we report a complementary stabilization mechanism based on surface disorder that has been unravelled through theoretical simulations that: account for surface energies and configurational entropies; show the importance of the ion distribution degeneracy; and identify low diffusion barriers between conformations that ensure equilibration. Disordered configurations in oxides might also be further stabilized by preferential adsorption of water. The entropic stabilization term will appear for surfaces with a high number of empty sites, typically achieved when removing part of the ions in a polar termination to make the layer charge zero. Assessing the impact of surface disorder when establishing new structure–activity relationships remains a challenge."
663,High-resolution three-dimensional structural microscopy by single-angle Bragg ptychography,2016-11-21,"Coherent X-ray microscopy by phase retrieval of Bragg diffraction intensities enables lattice distortions within a crystal to be imaged at nanometre-scale spatial resolutions in three dimensions. While this capability can be used to resolve structure–property relationships at the nanoscale under working conditions, strict data measurement requirements can limit the application of current approaches. Here, we introduce an efficient method of imaging three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale lattice behaviour and strain fields in crystalline materials with a methodology that we call 3D Bragg projection ptychography (3DBPP). This method enables 3D image reconstruction of a crystal volume from a series of two-dimensional X-ray Bragg coherent intensity diffraction patterns measured at a single incident beam angle. Structural information about the sample is encoded along two reciprocal-space directions normal to the Bragg diffracted exit beam, and along the third dimension in real space by the scanning beam. We present our approach with an analytical derivation, a numerical demonstration, and an experimental reconstruction of lattice distortions in a component of a nanoelectronic prototype device."
664,Reducing the efficiency–stability–cost gap of organic photovoltaics with highly efficient and stable small molecule acceptor ternary solar cells,2016-11-21,"Technological deployment of organic photovoltaic modules requires improvements in device light-conversion efficiency and stability while keeping material costs low. Here we demonstrate highly efficient and stable solar cells using a ternary approach, wherein two non-fullerene acceptors are combined with both a scalable and affordable donor polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and a high-efficiency, low-bandgap polymer in a single-layer bulk-heterojunction device. The addition of a strongly absorbing small molecule acceptor into a P3HT-based non-fullerene blend increases the device efficiency up to 7.7 ± 0.1% without any solvent additives. The improvement is assigned to changes in microstructure that reduce charge recombination and increase the photovoltage, and to improved light harvesting across the visible region. The stability of P3HT-based devices in ambient conditions is also significantly improved relative to polymer:fullerene devices. Combined with a low-bandgap donor polymer (PBDTTT-EFT, also known as PCE10), the two mixed acceptors also lead to solar cells with 11.0 ± 0.4% efficiency and a high open-circuit voltage of 1.03 ± 0.01 V."
665,Domain-wall conduction in ferroelectric BiFeO,2016-11-14,"Mobile charged defects, accumulated in the domain-wall region to screen polarization charges, have been proposed as the origin of the electrical conductivity at domain walls in ferroelectric materials. Despite theoretical and experimental efforts, this scenario has not been directly confirmed, leaving a gap in the understanding of the intriguing electrical properties of domain walls. Here, we provide atomic-scale chemical and structural analyses showing the accumulation of charged defects at domain walls in BiFeO3. The defects were identified as Fe4+ cations and bismuth vacancies, revealing p-type hopping conduction at domain walls caused by the presence of electron holes associated with Fe4+. In agreement with the p-type behaviour, we further show that the local domain-wall conductivity can be tailored by controlling the atmosphere during high-temperature annealing. This work has possible implications for engineering local conductivity in ferroelectrics and for devices based on domain walls."
666,Charge-transport model for conducting polymers,2016-11-14,"The growing technological importance of conducting polymers makes the fundamental understanding of their charge transport extremely important for materials and process design. Various hopping and mobility edge transport mechanisms have been proposed, but their experimental verification is limited to poor conductors. Now that advanced organic and polymer semiconductors have shown high conductivity approaching that of metals, the transport mechanism should be discernible by modelling the transport like a semiconductor with a transport edge and a transport parameter s. Here we analyse the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient together and determine that most polymers (except possibly PEDOT:tosylate) have s = 3 and thermally activated conductivity, whereas s = 1 and itinerant conductivity is typically found in crystalline semiconductors and metals. The different transport in polymers may result from the percolation of charge carriers from conducting ordered regions through poorly conducting disordered regions, consistent with what has been expected from structural studies."
667,Hybrid organic–inorganic inks flatten the energy landscape in colloidal quantum dot solids,2016-11-14,"Bandtail states in disordered semiconductor materials result in losses in open-circuit voltage (Voc) and inhibit carrier transport in photovoltaics. For colloidal quantum dot (CQD) films that promise low-cost, large-area, air-stable photovoltaics, bandtails are determined by CQD synthetic polydispersity and inhomogeneous aggregation during the ligand-exchange process. Here we introduce a new method for the synthesis of solution-phase ligand-exchanged CQD inks that enable a flat energy landscape and an advantageously high packing density. In the solid state, these materials exhibit a sharper bandtail and reduced energy funnelling compared with the previous best CQD thin films for photovoltaics. Consequently, we demonstrate solar cells with higher Voc and more efficient charge injection into the electron acceptor, allowing the use of a closer-to-optimum bandgap to absorb more light. These enable the fabrication of CQD solar cells made via a solution-phase ligand exchange, with a certified power conversion efficiency of 11.28%. The devices are stable when stored in air, unencapsulated, for over 1,000 h."
668,Structure of a model TiO,2016-11-14,"The interaction of water with TiO2 is crucial to many of its practical applications, including photocatalytic water splitting. Following the first demonstration of this phenomenon 40 years ago there have been numerous studies of the rutile single-crystal TiO2(110) interface with water. This has provided an atomic-level understanding of the water–TiO2 interaction. However, nearly all of the previous studies of water/TiO2 interfaces involve water in the vapour phase. Here, we explore the interfacial structure between liquid water and a rutile TiO2(110) surface pre-characterized at the atomic level. Scanning tunnelling microscopy and surface X-ray diffraction are used to determine the structure, which is comprised of an ordered array of hydroxyl molecules with molecular water in the second layer. Static and dynamic density functional theory calculations suggest that a possible mechanism for formation of the hydroxyl overlayer involves the mixed adsorption of O2 and H2O on a partially defected surface. The quantitative structural properties derived here provide a basis with which to explore the atomistic properties and hence mechanisms involved in TiO2 photocatalysis."
669,Localized dielectric breakdown and antireflection coating in metal–oxide–semiconductor photoelectrodes,2016-11-07,"Silicon-based photoelectrodes for solar fuel production have attracted great interest over the past decade, with the major challenge being silicon’s vulnerability to corrosion. A metal–insulator–semiconductor architecture, in which an insulator film serves as a protection layer, can prevent corrosion but must also allow low-resistance carrier transport, generally leading to a trade-off between stability and efficiency. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a general method to decouple the two roles of the insulator by employing localized dielectric breakdown. This approach allows the insulator to be thick, which enhances stability, while enabling low-resistance carrier transport as required for efficiency. This method can be applied to various oxides, such as SiO2 and Al2O3. In addition, it is suitable for silicon, III–V compounds, and other optical absorbers for both photocathodes and photoanodes. Finally, the thick metal-oxide layer can serve as a thin-film antireflection coating, which increases light absorption efficiency."
670,A multifunctional biphasic water splitting catalyst tailored for integration with high-performance semiconductor photoanodes,2016-11-07,"Artificial photosystems are advanced by the development of conformal catalytic materials that promote desired chemical transformations, while also maintaining stability and minimizing parasitic light absorption for integration on surfaces of semiconductor light absorbers. Here, we demonstrate that multifunctional, nanoscale catalysts that enable high-performance photoelectrochemical energy conversion can be engineered by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition. The collective properties of tailored Co3O4/Co(OH)2 thin films simultaneously provide high activity for water splitting, permit efficient interfacial charge transport from semiconductor substrates, and enhance durability of chemically sensitive interfaces. These films comprise compact and continuous nanocrystalline Co3O4 spinel that is impervious to phase transformation and impermeable to ions, thereby providing effective protection of the underlying substrate. Moreover, a secondary phase of structurally disordered and chemically labile Co(OH)2 is introduced to ensure a high concentration of catalytically active sites. Application of this coating to photovoltaic p+n-Si junctions yields best reported performance characteristics for crystalline Si photoanodes."
671,Collagen intrafibrillar mineralization as a result of the balance between osmotic equilibrium and electroneutrality,2016-11-07,"Mineralization of fibrillar collagen with biomimetic process-directing agents has enabled scientists to gain insight into the potential mechanisms involved in intrafibrillar mineralization. Here, by using polycation- and polyanion-directed intrafibrillar mineralization, we challenge the popular paradigm that electrostatic attraction is solely responsible for polyelectrolyte-directed intrafibrillar mineralization. As there is no difference when a polycationic or a polyanionic electrolyte is used to direct collagen mineralization, we argue that additional types of long-range non-electrostatic interaction are responsible for intrafibrillar mineralization. Molecular dynamics simulations of collagen structures in the presence of extrafibrillar polyelectrolytes show that the outward movement of ions and intrafibrillar water through the collagen surface occurs irrespective of the charges of polyelectrolytes, resulting in the experimentally verifiable contraction of the collagen structures. The need to balance electroneutrality and osmotic equilibrium simultaneously to establish Gibbs–Donnan equilibrium in a polyelectrolyte-directed mineralization system establishes a new model for collagen intrafibrillar mineralization that supplements existing collagen mineralization mechanisms."
672,MicroRNA-21 preserves the fibrotic mechanical memory of mesenchymal stem cells,2016-10-31,"Expansion on stiff culture substrates activates pro-fibrotic cell programs that are retained by mechanical memory. Here, we show that priming on physiologically soft silicone substrates suppresses fibrogenesis and desensitizes mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) against subsequent mechanical activation in vitro and in vivo, and identify the microRNA miR-21 as a long-term memory keeper of the fibrogenic program in MSCs. During stiff priming, miR-21 levels were gradually increased by continued regulation through the acutely mechanosensitive myocardin-related transcription factor-A (MRTF-A/MLK-1) and remained high over 2 weeks after removal of the mechanical stimulus. Knocking down miR-21 once by the end of the stiff-priming period was sufficient to erase the mechanical memory and sensitize MSCs to subsequent exposure to soft substrates. Soft priming and erasing mechanical memory following cell culture expansion protects MSCs from fibrogenesis in the host wound environment and increases the chances for success of MSC therapy in tissue-repair applications."
673,Nitroaromatic detection and infrared communication from wild-type plants using plant nanobionics,2016-10-31,"Plant nanobionics aims to embed non-native functions to plants by interfacing them with specifically designed nanoparticles. Here, we demonstrate that living spinach plants (Spinacia oleracea) can be engineered to serve as self-powered pre-concentrators and autosamplers of analytes in ambient groundwater and as infrared communication platforms that can send information to a smartphone. The plants employ a pair of near-infrared fluorescent nanosensors—single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) conjugated to the peptide Bombolitin II to recognize nitroaromatics via infrared fluorescent emission, and polyvinyl-alcohol functionalized SWCNTs that act as an invariant reference signal—embedded within the plant leaf mesophyll. As contaminant nitroaromatics are transported up the roots and stem into leaf tissues, they accumulate in the mesophyll, resulting in relative changes in emission intensity. The real-time monitoring of embedded SWCNT sensors also allows residence times in the roots, stems and leaves to be estimated, calculated to be 8.3 min (combined residence times of root and stem) and 1.9 min mm−1 leaf, respectively. These results demonstrate the ability of living, wild-type plants to function as chemical monitors of groundwater and communication devices to external electronics at standoff distances."
674,Tailoring exchange couplings in magnetic topological-insulator/antiferromagnet heterostructures,2016-10-31,"Magnetic topological insulators such as Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 provide a platform for the realization of versatile time-reversal symmetry-breaking physics. By constructing heterostructures exhibiting Néel order in an antiferromagnetic CrSb and ferromagnetic order in Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3, we realize emergent interfacial magnetic phenomena which can be tailored through artificial structural engineering. Through deliberate geometrical design of heterostructures and superlattices, we demonstrate the use of antiferromagnetic exchange coupling in manipulating the magnetic properties of magnetic topological insulators. Proximity effects are shown to induce an interfacial spin texture modulation and establish an effective long-range exchange coupling mediated by antiferromagnetism, which significantly enhances the magnetic ordering temperature in the superlattice. This work provides a new framework on integrating topological insulators with antiferromagnetic materials and unveils new avenues towards dissipationless topological antiferromagnetic spintronics."
675,Carrier generation and electronic properties of a single-component pure organic metal,2016-10-10,"Metallic conduction generally requires high carrier concentration and wide bandwidth derived from strong orbital interaction between atoms or molecules. These requisites are especially important in organic compounds because a molecule is fundamentally an insulator; only multi-component salts with strong intermolecular interaction—namely, only charge transfer complexes and conducting polymers—have demonstrated intrinsic metallic behaviour. Herein we report a single-component electroactive molecule, zwitterionic tetrathiafulvalene(TTF)-extended dicarboxylate radical (TED), exhibiting metallic conduction even at low temperatures. TED exhibits d.c. conductivities of 530 S cm−1 at 300 K and 1,000 S cm−1 at 50 K with copper-like electronic properties. Spectroscopic and theoretical investigations of the carrier-generation mechanism and the electronic states of this single molecular species reveal a unique electronic structure with a spin-density gradient in the extended TTF moieties that becomes, in itself, a metallic state."
676,Nanoscale structural oscillations in perovskite oxides induced by oxygen evolution,2016-10-03,"Understanding the interaction between water and oxides is critical for many technological applications, including energy storage, surface wetting/self-cleaning, photocatalysis and sensors. Here, we report observations of strong structural oscillations of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF) in the presence of both H2O vapour and electron irradiation using environmental transmission electron microscopy. These oscillations are related to the formation and collapse of gaseous bubbles. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy provides direct evidence of O2 formation in these bubbles due to the incorporation of H2O into BSCF. SrCoO3−δ was found to exhibit small oscillations, while none were observed for La0.5Sr0.5CoO3−δ and LaCoO3. The structural oscillations of BSCF can be attributed to the fact that its oxygen 2p-band centre is close to the Fermi level, which leads to a low energy penalty for oxygen vacancy formation, high ion mobility, and high water uptake. This work provides surprising insights into the interaction between water and oxides under electron-beam irradiation."
677,Direct–indirect character of the bandgap in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite,2016-10-03,"Metal halide perovskites such as methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) are generating great excitement due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties, which lend them to application in high-efficiency solar cells and light-emission devices. However, there is currently debate over what drives the second-order electron–hole recombination in these materials. Here, we propose that the bandgap in CH3NH3PbI3 has a direct–indirect character. Time-resolved photo-conductance measurements show that generation of free mobile charges is maximized for excitation energies just above the indirect bandgap. Furthermore, we find that second-order electron–hole recombination of photo-excited charges is retarded at lower temperature. These observations are consistent with a slow phonon-assisted recombination pathway via the indirect bandgap. Interestingly, in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase, fast quenching of mobile charges occurs independent of the temperature and photon excitation energy. Our work provides a new framework to understand the optoelectronic properties of metal halide perovskites and analyse spectroscopic data."
678,Complete prevention of blood loss with self-sealing haemostatic needles,2016-10-03,"Bleeding is largely unavoidable following syringe needle puncture of biological tissues and, while inconvenient, this typically causes little or no harm in healthy individuals. However, there are certain circumstances where syringe injections can have more significant side effects, such as uncontrolled bleeding in those with haemophilia, coagulopathy, or the transmission of infectious diseases through contaminated blood. Herein, we present a haemostatic hypodermic needle able to prevent bleeding following tissue puncture. The surface of the needle is coated with partially crosslinked catechol-functionalized chitosan that undergoes a solid-to-gel phase transition in situ to seal punctured tissues. Testing the capabilities of these haemostatic needles, we report complete prevention of blood loss following intravenous and intramuscular injections in animal models, and 100% survival in haemophiliac mice following syringe puncture of the jugular vein. Such self-sealing haemostatic needles and adhesive coatings may therefore help to prevent complications associated with bleeding in more clinical settings."
679,Generation of subnanometric platinum with high stability during transformation of a 2D zeolite into 3D,2016-09-26,"Single metal atoms and metal clusters have attracted much attention thanks to their advantageous capabilities as heterogeneous catalysts. However, the generation of stable single atoms and clusters on a solid support is still challenging. Herein, we report a new strategy for the generation of single Pt atoms and Pt clusters with exceptionally high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions. These subnanometric Pt species are stabilized by MCM-22, even after treatment in air up to 540 °C. Furthermore, these stable Pt species confined within internal framework cavities show size-selective catalysis for the hydrogenation of alkenes. High-temperature oxidation–reduction treatments result in the growth of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the approximate size range of 1 to 2 nm. The stability and catalytic activity of encapsulated Pt species is also reflected in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
680,Memristors with diffusive dynamics as synaptic emulators for neuromorphic computing,2016-09-26,"The accumulation and extrusion of Ca2+ in the pre- and postsynaptic compartments play a critical role in initiating plastic changes in biological synapses. To emulate this fundamental process in electronic devices, we developed diffusive Ag-in-oxide memristors with a temporal response during and after stimulation similar to that of the synaptic Ca2+ dynamics. In situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle dynamics simulations both demonstrate that Ag atoms disperse under electrical bias and regroup spontaneously under zero bias because of interfacial energy minimization, closely resembling synaptic influx and extrusion of Ca2+, respectively. The diffusive memristor and its dynamics enable a direct emulation of both short- and long-term plasticity of biological synapses, representing an advance in hardware implementation of neuromorphic functionalities."
681,"Porous microwells for geometry-selective, large-scale microparticle arrays",2016-09-05,"Large-scale microparticle arrays (LSMAs) are key for material science and bioengineering applications. However, previous approaches suffer from trade-offs between scalability, precision, specificity and versatility. Here, we present a porous microwell-based approach to create large-scale microparticle arrays with complex motifs. Microparticles are guided to and pushed into microwells by fluid flow through small open pores at the bottom of the porous well arrays. A scaling theory allows for the rational design of LSMAs to sort and array particles on the basis of their size, shape, or modulus. Sequential particle assembly allows for proximal and nested particle arrangements, as well as particle recollection and pattern transfer. We demonstrate the capabilities of the approach by means of three applications: high-throughput single-cell arrays; microenvironment fabrication for neutrophil chemotaxis; and complex, covert tags by the transfer of an upconversion nanocrystal-laden LSMA."
682,Intrusion rheology in grains and other flowable materials,2016-08-29,"The interaction of intruding objects with deformable materials arises in many contexts, including locomotion in fluids and loose media, impact and penetration problems, and geospace applications. Despite the complex constitutive behaviour of granular media, forces on arbitrarily shaped granular intruders are observed to obey surprisingly simple, yet empirical ‘resistive force hypotheses’. The physics of this macroscale reduction, and how it might play out in other media, has however remained elusive. Here, we show that all resistive force hypotheses in grains arise from local frictional yielding, revealing a novel invariance within a class of plasticity models. This mechanical foundation, supported by numerical and experimental validations, leads to a general analytical criterion to determine which rheologies can obey resistive force hypotheses. We use it to explain why viscous fluids are observed to perform worse than grains, and to predict a new family of resistive-force-obeying materials: cohesive media such as pastes, gels and muds."
683,Highly efficient and tunable spin-to-charge conversion through Rashba coupling at oxide interfaces,2016-08-29,"The spin–orbit interaction couples the electrons’ motion to their spin. As a result, a charge current running through a material with strong spin–orbit coupling generates a transverse spin current (spin Hall effect, SHE) and vice versa (inverse spin Hall effect, ISHE). The emergence of SHE and ISHE as charge-to-spin interconversion mechanisms offers a variety of novel spintronic functionalities and devices, some of which do not require any ferromagnetic material. However, the interconversion efficiency of SHE and ISHE (spin Hall angle) is a bulk property that rarely exceeds ten percent, and does not take advantage of interfacial and low-dimensional effects otherwise ubiquitous in spintronic hetero- and mesostructures. Here, we make use of an interface-driven spin–orbit coupling mechanism—the Rashba effect—in the oxide two-dimensional electron system (2DES) LaAlO3/SrTiO3 to achieve spin-to-charge conversion with unprecedented efficiency. Through spin pumping, we inject a spin current from a NiFe film into the oxide 2DES and detect the resulting charge current, which can be strongly modulated by a gate voltage. We discuss the amplitude of the effect and its gate dependence on the basis of the electronic structure of the 2DES and highlight the importance of a long scattering time to achieve efficient spin-to-charge interconversion."
684,Anomalous phonon scattering and elastic correlations in amorphous solids,2016-08-29,"A major issue in materials science is why glasses present low-temperature thermal and vibrational properties that sharply differ from those of crystals. In particular, long-wavelength phonons are considerably more damped in glasses, yet it remains unclear how structural disorder at atomic scales affects such a macroscopic phenomenon. A plausible explanation is that phonons are scattered by local elastic heterogeneities that are essentially uncorrelated in space, a scenario known as Rayleigh scattering, which predicts that the damping of acoustic phonons scales with wavenumber k as kd+1 (in dimension d). Here we demonstrate that phonon damping scales instead as − kd+1 ln k, with this logarithmic enhancement originating from long-range spatial correlations of elastic disorder caused by similar stress correlations. Our work suggests that the presence of long-range spatial correlations of local stress and elasticity may well be the crucial feature that distinguishes amorphous solids from crystals."
685,Melt-driven mechanochemical phase transformations in moderately exothermic powder mixtures,2016-08-22,"Usually, mechanochemical reactions between solid phases are either gradual (by deformation-induced mixing), or self-propagating (by exothermic chemical reaction). Here, by means of a systematic kinetic analysis of the Bi–Te system reacting to Bi2Te3, we establish a third possibility: if one or more of the powder reactants has a low melting point and low thermal effusivity, it is possible that local melting can occur from deformation-induced heating. The presence of hot liquid then triggers chemical mixing locally. The molten events are constrained to individual particles, making them distinct from self-propagating reactions, and occur much faster than conventional gradual reactions. We show that the mechanism is applicable to a broad variety of materials systems, many of which have important functional properties. This mechanistic picture offers a new perspective as compared to conventional, gradual mechanochemical synthesis, where thermal effects are generally ignored."
686,Transcription upregulation via force-induced direct stretching of chromatin,2016-08-22,"Mechanical forces play critical roles in the function of living cells. However, the underlying mechanisms of how forces influence nuclear events remain elusive. Here, we show that chromatin deformation as well as force-induced transcription of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged bacterial-chromosome dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) transgene can be visualized in a living cell by using three-dimensional magnetic twisting cytometry to apply local stresses on the cell surface via an Arg-Gly-Asp-coated magnetic bead. Chromatin stretching depended on loading direction. DHFR transcription upregulation was sensitive to load direction and proportional to the magnitude of chromatin stretching. Disrupting filamentous actin or inhibiting actomyosin contraction abrogated or attenuated force-induced DHFR transcription, whereas activating endogenous contraction upregulated force-induced DHFR transcription. Our findings suggest that local stresses applied to integrins propagate from the tensed actin cytoskeleton to the LINC complex and then through lamina–chromatin interactions to directly stretch chromatin and upregulate transcription."
687,Linear topology in amorphous metal oxide electrochromic networks obtained via low-temperature solution processing,2016-08-22,"Amorphous transition metal oxides are recognized as leading candidates for electrochromic window coatings that can dynamically modulate solar irradiation and improve building energy efficiency. However, their thin films are normally prepared by energy-intensive sputtering techniques or high-temperature solution methods, which increase manufacturing cost and complexity. Here, we report on a room-temperature solution process to fabricate electrochromic films of niobium oxide glass (NbOx) and ‘nanocrystal-in-glass’ composites (that is, tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) nanocrystals embedded in NbOx glass) via acid-catalysed condensation of polyniobate clusters. A combination of X-ray scattering and spectroscopic characterization with complementary simulations reveals that this strategy leads to a unique one-dimensional chain-like NbOx structure, which significantly enhances the electrochromic performance, compared to a typical three-dimensional NbOx network obtained from conventional high-temperature thermal processing. In addition, we show how self-assembled ITO-in-NbOx composite films can be successfully integrated into high-performance flexible electrochromic devices."
688,Mechanism of hard-nanomaterial clearance by the liver,2016-08-15,"The liver and spleen are major biological barriers to translating nanomedicines because they sequester the majority of administered nanomaterials and prevent delivery to diseased tissue. Here we examined the blood clearance mechanism of administered hard nanomaterials in relation to blood flow dynamics, organ microarchitecture and cellular phenotype. We found that nanomaterial velocity reduces 1,000-fold as they enter and traverse the liver, leading to 7.5 times more nanomaterial interaction with hepatic cells relative to peripheral cells. In the liver, Kupffer cells (84.8 ± 6.4%), hepatic B cells (81.5 ± 9.3%) and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (64.6 ± 13.7%) interacted with administered PEGylated quantum dots, but splenic macrophages took up less material (25.4 ± 10.1%) due to differences in phenotype. The uptake patterns were similar for two other nanomaterial types and five different surface chemistries. Potential new strategies to overcome off-target nanomaterial accumulation may involve manipulating intra-organ flow dynamics and modulating the cellular phenotype to alter hepatic cell interactions."
689,Anisotropic phase segregation and migration of Pt in nanocrystals en route to nanoframe catalysts,2016-08-15,"Compositional heterogeneity in shaped, bimetallic nanocrystals offers additional variables to manoeuvre the functionality of the nanocrystal. However, understanding how to manipulate anisotropic elemental distributions in a nanocrystal is a great challenge in reaching higher tiers of nanocatalyst design. Here, we present the evolutionary trajectory of phase segregation in Pt–Ni rhombic dodecahedra. The anisotropic growth of a Pt-rich phase along the 〈111〉 and 〈200〉 directions at the initial growth stage results in Pt segregation to the 14 axes of a rhombic dodecahedron, forming a highly branched, Pt-rich tetradecapod structure embedded in a Ni-rich shell. With longer growth time, the Pt-rich phase selectively migrates outwards through the 14 axes to the 24 edges such that the rhombic dodecahedron becomes a Pt-rich frame enclosing a Ni-rich interior phase. The revealed anisotropic phase segregation and migration mechanism offers a radically different approach to fabrication of nanocatalysts with desired compositional distributions and performance."
690,N-cadherin adhesive interactions modulate matrix mechanosensing and fate commitment of mesenchymal stem cells,2016-08-15,"During mesenchymal development, the microenvironment gradually transitions from one that is rich in cell–cell interactions to one that is dominated by cell–ECM (extracellular matrix) interactions. Because these cues cannot readily be decoupled in vitro or in vivo, how they converge to regulate mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) mechanosensing is not fully understood. Here, we show that a hyaluronic acid hydrogel system enables, across a physiological range of ECM stiffness, the independent co-presentation of the HAVDI adhesive motif from the EC1 domain of N-cadherin and the RGD adhesive motif from fibronectin. Decoupled presentation of these cues revealed that HAVDI ligation (at constant RGD ligation) reduced the contractile state and thereby nuclear YAP/TAZ localization in MSCs, resulting in altered interpretation of ECM stiffness and subsequent changes in downstream cell proliferation and differentiation. Our findings reveal that, in an evolving developmental context, HAVDI/N-cadherin interactions can alter stem cell perception of the stiffening extracellular microenvironment."
691,Detection and imaging of quorum sensing in ,2016-08-08,"Most bacteria in nature exist as biofilms, which support intercellular signalling processes such as quorum sensing (QS), a cell-to-cell communication mechanism that allows bacteria to monitor and respond to cell density and changes in the environment. As QS and biofilms are involved in the ability of bacteria to cause disease, there is a need for the development of methods for the non-invasive analysis of QS in natural bacterial populations. Here, by using surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering spectroscopy, we report rationally designed nanostructured plasmonic substrates for the in situ, label-free detection of a QS signalling metabolite in growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms and microcolonies. The in situ, non-invasive plasmonic imaging of QS in biofilms provides a powerful analytical approach for studying intercellular communication on the basis of secreted molecules as signals."
692,Design of efficient molecular organic light-emitting diodes by a high-throughput virtual screening and experimental approach,2016-08-08,"Virtual screening is becoming a ground-breaking tool for molecular discovery due to the exponential growth of available computer time and constant improvement of simulation and machine learning techniques. We report an integrated organic functional material design process that incorporates theoretical insight, quantum chemistry, cheminformatics, machine learning, industrial expertise, organic synthesis, molecular characterization, device fabrication and optoelectronic testing. After exploring a search space of 1.6 million molecules and screening over 400,000 of them using time-dependent density functional theory, we identified thousands of promising novel organic light-emitting diode molecules across the visible spectrum. Our team collaboratively selected the best candidates from this set. The experimentally determined external quantum efficiencies for these synthesized candidates were as large as 22%."
693,The nanocomposite nature of bone drives its strength and damage resistance,2016-08-08,"In human bone, an amorphous mineral serves as a precursor to the formation of a highly substituted nanocrystalline apatite. However, the precise role of this amorphous mineral remains unknown. Here, we show by using transmission electron microscopy that 100–300 nm amorphous calcium phosphate regions are present in the disordered phase of trabecular bone. Nanomechanical experiments on cylindrical samples, with diameters between 250 nm and 3,000 nm, of the bone’s ordered and disordered phases revealed a transition from plastic deformation to brittle failure and at least a factor-of-2 higher strength in the smaller samples. We postulate that this transition in failure mechanism is caused by the suppression of extrafibrillar shearing in the smaller samples, and that the emergent smaller-is-stronger size effect is related to the sample-size scaling of the distribution of flaws. Our findings should help in the understanding of the multi-scale nature of bone and provide insights into the biomineralization process."
694,Electrochemical stiffness in lithium-ion batteries,2016-08-01,"Although lithium-ion batteries are ubiquitous in portable electronics, increased charge rate and discharge power are required for more demanding applications such as electric vehicles. The high-rate exchange of lithium ions required for more power and faster charging generates significant stresses and strains in the electrodes that ultimately lead to performance degradation. To date, electrochemically induced stresses and strains in battery electrodes have been studied only individually. Here, a new technique is developed to probe the chemomechanical response of electrodes by calculating the electrochemical stiffness via coordinated in situ stress and strain measurements. We show that dramatic changes in electrochemical stiffness occur due to the formation of different graphite–lithium intercalation compounds during cycling. Our analysis reveals that stress scales proportionally with the lithiation/delithiation rate and strain scales proportionally with capacity (and inversely with rate). Electrochemical stiffness measurements provide new insights into the origin of rate-dependent chemomechanical degradation and the evaluation of advanced battery electrodes."
695,Decoupling a hole spin qubit from the nuclear spins,2016-07-25,"A huge effort is underway to develop semiconductor nanostructures as low-noise hosts for qubits. The main source of dephasing of an electron spin qubit in a GaAs-based system is the nuclear spin bath. A hole spin may circumvent the nuclear spin noise. In principle, the nuclear spins can be switched off for a pure heavy-hole spin. In practice, it is unknown to what extent this ideal limit can be achieved. A major hindrance is that p-type devices are often far too noisy. We investigate here a single hole spin in an InGaAs quantum dot embedded in a new generation of low-noise p-type device. We measure the hole Zeeman energy in a transverse magnetic field with 10 neV resolution by dark-state spectroscopy as we create a large transverse nuclear spin polarization. The hole hyperfine interaction is highly anisotropic: the transverse coupling is <1% of the longitudinal coupling. For unpolarized, randomly fluctuating nuclei, the ideal heavy-hole limit is achieved down to nanoelectronvolt energies; equivalently dephasing times up to a microsecond. The combination of large  and strong optical dipole makes the single hole spin in a GaAs-based device an attractive quantum platform."
696,Thermally stable coexistence of liquid and solid phases in gallium nanoparticles,2016-07-25,"Gallium (Ga), a group III metal, is of fundamental interest due to its polymorphism and unusual phase transition behaviours. New solid phases have been observed when Ga is confined at the nanoscale. Herein, we demonstrate the stable coexistence, from 180 K to 800 K, of the unexpected solid γ-phase core and a liquid shell in substrate-supported Ga nanoparticles. We show that the support plays a fundamental role in determining Ga nanoparticle phases, with the driving forces for the nucleation of the γ-phase being the Laplace pressure in the nanoparticles and the epitaxial relationship of this phase to the substrate. We exploit the change in the amplitude of the evolving surface plasmon resonance of Ga nanoparticle ensembles during synthesis to reveal in real time the solid core formation in the liquid Ga nanoparticle. Finally, we provide a general framework for understanding how nanoscale confinement, interfacial and surface energies, and crystalline relationships to the substrate enable and stabilize the coexistence of unexpected phases."
697,Local triple-combination therapy results in tumour regression and prevents recurrence in a colon cancer model,2016-07-25,"Conventional cancer therapies involve the systemic delivery of anticancer agents that neither discriminate between cancer and normal cells nor eliminate the risk of cancer recurrence. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of gene, drug and phototherapy delivered through a prophylactic hydrogel patch leads, in a colon cancer mouse model, to complete tumour remission when applied to non-resected tumours and to the absence of tumour recurrence when applied following tumour resection. The adhesive hydrogel patch enhanced the stability and provided local delivery of embedded nanoparticles. Spherical gold nanoparticles were used as a first wave of treatment to deliver siRNAs against Kras, a key oncogene driver, and rod-shaped gold nanoparticles mediated the conversion of near-infrared radiation into heat, causing the release of a chemotherapeutic as well as thermally induced cell damage. This local, triple-combination therapy can be adapted to other cancer cell types and to molecular targets associated with disease progression."
698,Multiscale metallic metamaterials,2016-07-18,"Materials with three-dimensional micro- and nanoarchitectures exhibit many beneficial mechanical, energy conversion and optical properties. However, these three-dimensional microarchitectures are significantly limited by their scalability. Efforts have only been successful only in demonstrating overall structure sizes of hundreds of micrometres, or contain size-scale gaps of several orders of magnitude. This results in degraded mechanical properties at the macroscale. Here we demonstrate hierarchical metamaterials with disparate three-dimensional features spanning seven orders of magnitude, from nanometres to centimetres. At the macroscale they achieve high tensile elasticity (>20%) not found in their brittle-like metallic constituents, and a near-constant specific strength. Creation of these materials is enabled by a high-resolution, large-area additive manufacturing technique with scalability not achievable by two-photon polymerization or traditional stereolithography. With overall part sizes approaching tens of centimetres, these unique nanostructured metamaterials might find use in a broad array of applications."
699,Reversible phase modulation and hydrogen storage in multivalent VO,2016-07-11,"Hydrogen, the smallest and the lightest atomic element, is reversibly incorporated into interstitial sites in vanadium dioxide (VO2), a correlated oxide with a 3d1 electronic configuration, and induces electronic phase modulation. It is widely reported that low hydrogen concentrations stabilize the metallic phase, but the understanding of hydrogen in the high doping regime is limited. Here, we demonstrate that as many as two hydrogen atoms can be incorporated into each VO2 unit cell, and that hydrogen is reversibly absorbed into, and released from, VO2 without destroying its lattice framework. This hydrogenation process allows us to elucidate electronic phase modulation of vanadium oxyhydride, demonstrating two-step insulator (VO2)–metal (HxVO2)–insulator (HVO2) phase modulation during inter-integer d-band filling. Our finding suggests the possibility of reversible and dynamic control of topotactic phase modulation in VO2 and opens up the potential application in proton-based Mottronics and novel hydrogen storage."
700,Topological edge states in a high-temperature superconductor FeSe/SrTiO,2016-07-04,"Superconducting and topological states are two most intriguing quantum phenomena in solid materials. The entanglement of these two states, the topological superconducting state, will give rise to even more exotic quantum phenomena. While many materials are found to be either a superconductor or a topological insulator, it is very rare that both states exist in one material. Here, we demonstrate by first-principles theory as well as scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments that the recently discovered ‘two-dimensional (2D) superconductor’ of single-layer FeSe also exhibits 1D topological edge states within an energy gap of ∼40 meV at the M point below the Fermi level. It is the first 2D material that supports both superconducting and topological states, offering an exciting opportunity to study 2D topological superconductors through the proximity effect."
701,Polyvinylpyrrolidone-induced anisotropic growth of gold nanoprisms in plasmon-driven synthesis,2016-07-04,"After more than a decade, it is still unknown whether the plasmon-mediated growth of silver nanostructures can be extended to the synthesis of other noble metals, as the molecular mechanisms governing the growth process remain elusive. Herein, we demonstrate the plasmon-driven synthesis of gold nanoprisms and elucidate the details of the photochemical growth mechanism at the single-nanoparticle level. Our investigation reveals that the surfactant polyvinylpyrrolidone preferentially adsorbs along the nanoprism perimeter and serves as a photochemical relay to direct the anisotropic growth of gold nanoprisms. This discovery confers a unique function to polyvinylpyrrolidone that is fundamentally different from its widely accepted role as a crystal-face-blocking ligand. Additionally, we find that nanocrystal twinning exerts a profound influence on the kinetics of this photochemical process by controlling the transport of plasmon-generated hot electrons to polyvinylpyrrolidone. These insights establish a molecular-level description of the underlying mechanisms regulating the plasmon-driven synthesis of gold nanoprisms."
702,Elastic and thermal expansion asymmetry in dense molecular materials,2016-06-27,"The elastic modulus and coefficient of thermal expansion are fundamental properties of elastically stiff molecular materials and are assumed to be the same (symmetric) under both tension and compression loading. We show that molecular materials can have a marked asymmetric elastic modulus and coefficient of thermal expansion that are inherently related to terminal chemical groups that limit molecular network connectivity. In compression, terminal groups sterically interact to stiffen the network, whereas in tension they interact less and disconnect the network. The existence of asymmetric elastic and thermal expansion behaviour has fundamental implications for computational approaches to molecular materials modelling and practical implications on the thermomechanical strains and associated elastic stresses. We develop a design space to control the degree of elastic asymmetry in molecular materials, a vital step towards understanding their integration into device technologies."
703,Heterogeneous silicon mesostructures for lipid-supported bioelectric interfaces,2016-06-27,"Silicon-based materials have widespread application as biophysical tools and biomedical devices. Here we introduce a biocompatible and degradable mesostructured form of silicon with multi-scale structural and chemical heterogeneities. The material was synthesized using mesoporous silica as a template through a chemical vapour deposition process. It has an amorphous atomic structure, an ordered nanowire-based framework and random submicrometre voids, and shows an average Young’s modulus that is 2–3 orders of magnitude smaller than that of single-crystalline silicon. In addition, we used the heterogeneous silicon mesostructures to design a lipid-bilayer-supported bioelectric interface that is remotely controlled and temporally transient, and that permits non-genetic and subcellular optical modulation of the electrophysiology dynamics in single dorsal root ganglia neurons. Our findings suggest that the biomimetic expansion of silicon into heterogeneous and deformable forms can open up opportunities in extracellular biomaterial or bioelectric systems."
704,Polysynthetic twinned TiAl single crystals for high-temperature applications,2016-06-20,"TiAl alloys are lightweight, show decent corrosion resistance and have good mechanical properties at elevated temperatures, making them appealing for high-temperature applications. However, polysynthetic twinned TiAl single crystals fabricated by crystal-seeding methods face substantial challenges, and their service temperatures cannot be raised further. Here we report that Ti–45Al–8Nb single crystals with controlled lamellar orientations can be fabricated by directional solidification without the use of complex seeding methods. Samples with 0° lamellar orientation exhibit an average room temperature tensile ductility of 6.9% and a yield strength of 708 MPa, with a failure strength of 978 MPa due to the formation of extensive nanotwins during plastic deformation. At 900 °C yield strength remains high at 637 MPa, with 8.1% ductility and superior creep resistance. Thus, this TiAl single-crystal alloy could provide expanded opportunities for higher-temperature applications, such as in aeronautics and aerospace."
705,Facet-dependent trapping and dynamics of excess electrons at anatase TiO,2016-06-20,"Excess electrons from intrinsic defects, dopants and photoexcitation play a key role in many of the properties of TiO2. Understanding their behaviour is important for improving the performance of TiO2 in energy-related applications. We focus on anatase, the TiO2 polymorph most relevant in photocatalysis and solar energy conversion. Using first-principles simulations, we investigate the states and dynamics of excess electrons from different donors near the most common anatase (101) and (001) surfaces and aqueous interfaces. We find that the behaviour of excess electrons depends strongly on the exposed anatase surface, the environment and the character of the electron donor. Whereas no electron trapping is observed on the (101) surface in vacuo, an excess electron at the aqueous (101) interface can trigger water dissociation and become trapped into a stable surface Ti3+-bridging OH complex. By contrast, electrons avoid the (001) surface, indicating that oxidation reactions are favoured on this surface. Our results provide a bridge between surface science experiments and observations of crystal-face-dependent photocatalysis on anatase, and support the idea that optimization of the ratio between {101} and {001} facets could provide a way to enhance the photocatalytic activity of this material."
706,Understanding soft glassy materials using an energy landscape approach,2016-06-20,"Many seemingly different soft materials—such as soap foams, mayonnaise, toothpaste and living cells—display strikingly similar viscoelastic behaviour. A fundamental physical understanding of such soft glassy rheology and how it can manifest in such diverse materials, however, remains unknown. Here, by using a model soap foam consisting of compressible spherical bubbles, whose sizes slowly evolve and whose collective motion is simply dictated by energy minimization, we study the foam’s dynamics as it corresponds to downhill motion on an energy landscape function spanning a high-dimensional configuration space. We find that these downhill paths, when viewed in this configuration space, are, surprisingly, fractal. The complex behaviour of our model, including power-law rheology and non-diffusive bubble motion and avalanches, stems directly from the fractal dimension and energy function of these paths. Our results suggest that ubiquitous soft glassy rheology may be a consequence of emergent fractal geometry in the energy landscapes of many complex fluids."
707,The role of electronic coupling between substrate and 2D MoS,2016-06-13,The excellent catalytic activity of metallic MoS2 edges for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has led to substantial efforts towards increasing the edge concentration. The 2H basal plane is less active for the HER because it is less conducting and therefore possesses less efficient charge transfer kinetics. Here we show that the activity of the 2H basal planes of monolayer MoS2 nanosheets can be made comparable to state-of-the-art catalytic properties of metallic edges and the 1T phase by improving the electrical coupling between the substrate and the catalyst so that electron injection from the electrode and transport to the catalyst active site is facilitated. Phase-engineered low-resistance contacts on monolayer 2H-phase MoS2 basal plane lead to higher efficiency of charge injection in the nanosheets so that its intrinsic activity towards the HER can be measured. We demonstrate that onset potentials and Tafel slopes of ∼−0.1 V and ∼50 mV per decade can be achieved from 2H-phase catalysts where only the basal plane is exposed. We show that efficient charge injection and the presence of naturally occurring sulfur vacancies are responsible for the observed increase in catalytic activity of the 2H basal plane. Our results provide new insights into the role of contact resistance and charge transport on the performance of two-dimensional MoS2 nanosheet catalysts for the HER.
708,Crystal symmetry breaking and vacancies in colloidal lead chalcogenide quantum dots,2016-06-13,"Size and shape tunability and low-cost solution processability make colloidal lead chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs) an emerging class of building blocks for innovative photovoltaic, thermoelectric and optoelectronic devices. Lead chalcogenide QDs are known to crystallize in the rock-salt structure, although with very different atomic order and stoichiometry in the core and surface regions; however, there exists no convincing prior identification of how extreme downsizing and surface-induced ligand effects influence structural distortion. Using forefront X-ray scattering techniques and density functional theory calculations, here we have identified that, at sizes below 8 nm, PbS and PbSe QDs undergo a lattice distortion with displacement of the Pb sublattice, driven by ligand-induced tensile strain. The resulting permanent electric dipoles may have implications on the oriented attachment of these QDs. Evidence is found for a Pb-deficient core and, in the as-synthesized QDs, for a rhombic dodecahedral shape with nonpolar {110} facets. On varying the nature of the surface ligands, differences in lattice strains are found."
709,Improved chemical and electrochemical stability of perovskite oxides with less reducible cations at the surface,2016-06-13,"Segregation and phase separation of aliovalent dopants on perovskite oxide (ABO3) surfaces are detrimental to the performance of energy conversion systems such as solid oxide fuel/electrolysis cells and catalysts for thermochemical H2O and CO2 splitting. One key reason behind the instability of perovskite oxide surfaces is the electrostatic attraction of the negatively charged A-site dopants (for example, ) by the positively charged oxygen vacancies () enriched at the surface. Here we show that reducing the surface  concentration improves the oxygen surface exchange kinetics and stability significantly, albeit contrary to the well-established understanding that surface oxygen vacancies facilitate reactions with O2 molecules. We take La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 (LSC) as a model perovskite oxide, and modify its surface with additive cations that are more and less reducible than Co on the B-site of LSC. By using ambient-pressure X-ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy, we proved that the dominant role of the less reducible cations is to suppress the enrichment and phase separation of Sr while reducing the concentration of  and making the LSC more oxidized at its surface. Consequently, we found that these less reducible cations significantly improve stability, with up to 30 times faster oxygen exchange kinetics after 54 h in air at 530 °C achieved by Hf addition onto LSC. Finally, the results revealed a ‘volcano’ relation between the oxygen exchange kinetics and the oxygen vacancy formation enthalpy of the binary oxides of the additive cations. This volcano relation highlights the existence of an optimum surface oxygen vacancy concentration that balances the gain in oxygen exchange kinetics and the chemical stability loss."
710,Tuning the energetics and tailoring the optical properties of silver clusters confined in zeolites,2016-06-06,"The integration of metal atoms and clusters in well-defined dielectric cavities is a powerful strategy to impart new properties to them that depend on the size and geometry of the confined space as well as on metal–host electrostatic interactions. Here, we unravel the dependence of the electronic properties of metal clusters on space confinement by studying the ionization potential of silver clusters embedded in four different zeolite environments over a range of silver concentrations. Extensive characterization reveals a strong influence of silver loading and host environment on the cluster ionization potential, which is also correlated to the cluster’s optical and structural properties. Through fine-tuning of the zeolite host environment, we demonstrate photoluminescence quantum yields approaching unity. This work extends our understanding of structure–property relationships of small metal clusters and applies this understanding to develop highly photoluminescent materials with potential applications in optoelectronics and bioimaging."
711,Reversible optical switching of highly confined phonon–polaritons with an ultrathin phase-change material,2016-05-23,"Surface phonon–polaritons (SPhPs), collective excitations of photons coupled with phonons in polar crystals, enable strong light–matter interaction and numerous infrared nanophotonic applications. However, as the lattice vibrations are determined by the crystal structure, the dynamical control of SPhPs remains challenging. Here, we realize the all-optical, non-volatile, and reversible switching of SPhPs by controlling the structural phase of a phase-change material (PCM) employed as a switchable dielectric environment. We experimentally demonstrate optical switching of an ultrathin PCM film (down to 7 nm, <λ/1,200) with single laser pulses and detect ultra-confined SPhPs (polariton wavevector kp > 70k0, k0 = 2π/λ) in quartz. Our proof of concept allows the preparation of all-dielectric, rewritable SPhP resonators without the need for complex fabrication methods. With optimized materials and parallelized optical addressing we foresee application potential for switchable infrared nanophotonic elements, for example, imaging elements such as superlenses and hyperlenses, as well as reconfigurable metasurfaces and sensors."
712,Biomimetic proteolipid vesicles for targeting inflamed tissues,2016-05-23,"A multitude of micro- and nanoparticles have been developed to improve the delivery of systemically administered pharmaceuticals, which are subject to a number of biological barriers that limit their optimal biodistribution. Bioinspired drug-delivery carriers formulated by bottom-up or top-down strategies have emerged as an alternative approach to evade the mononuclear phagocytic system and facilitate transport across the endothelial vessel wall. Here, we describe a method that leverages the advantages of bottom-up and top-down strategies to incorporate proteins derived from the leukocyte plasma membrane into lipid nanoparticles. The resulting proteolipid vesicles—which we refer to as leukosomes—retained the versatility and physicochemical properties typical of liposomal formulations, preferentially targeted inflamed vasculature, enabled the selective and effective delivery of dexamethasone to inflamed tissues, and reduced phlogosis in a localized model of inflammation."
713,Exploring the origin of high optical absorption in conjugated polymers,2016-05-16,"The specific optical absorption of an organic semiconductor is critical to the performance of organic optoelectronic devices. For example, higher light-harvesting efficiency can lead to higher photocurrent in solar cells that are limited by sub-optimal electrical transport. Here, we compare over 40 conjugated polymers, and find that many different chemical structures share an apparent maximum in their extinction coefficients. However, a diketopyrrolopyrrole-thienothiophene copolymer shows remarkably high optical absorption at relatively low photon energies. By investigating its backbone structure and conformation with measurements and quantum chemical calculations, we find that the high optical absorption can be explained by the high persistence length of the polymer. Accordingly, we demonstrate high absorption in other polymers with high theoretical persistence length. Visible light harvesting may be enhanced in other conjugated polymers through judicious design of the structure."
714,An elastic second skin,2016-05-09,"We report the synthesis and application of an elastic, wearable crosslinked polymer layer (XPL) that mimics the properties of normal, youthful skin. XPL is made of a tunable polysiloxane-based material that can be engineered with specific elasticity, contractility, adhesion, tensile strength and occlusivity. XPL can be topically applied, rapidly curing at the skin interface without the need for heat- or light-mediated activation. In a pilot human study, we examined the performance of a prototype XPL that has a tensile modulus matching normal skin responses at low strain (<40%), and that withstands elongations exceeding 250%, elastically recoiling with minimal strain-energy loss on repeated deformation. The application of XPL to the herniated lower eyelid fat pads of 12 subjects resulted in an average 2-grade decrease in herniation appearance in a 5-point severity scale. The XPL platform may offer advanced solutions to compromised skin barrier function, pharmaceutical delivery and wound dressings."
715,2D coherent charge transport in highly ordered conducting polymers doped by solid state diffusion,2016-05-09,"Doping is one of the most important methods to control charge carrier concentration in semiconductors. Ideally, the introduction of dopants should not perturb the ordered microstructure of the semiconducting host. In some systems, such as modulation-doped inorganic semiconductors or molecular charge transfer crystals, this can be achieved by spatially separating the dopants from the charge transport pathways. However, in conducting polymers, dopants tend to be randomly distributed within the conjugated polymer, and as a result the transport properties are strongly affected by the resulting structural and electronic disorder. Here, we show that in the highly ordered lamellar microstructure of a regioregular thiophene-based conjugated polymer, a small-molecule p-type dopant can be incorporated by solid state diffusion into the layers of solubilizing side chains without disrupting the conjugated layers. In contrast to more disordered systems, this allows us to observe coherent, free-electron-like charge transport properties, including a nearly ideal Hall effect in a wide temperature range, a positive magnetoconductance due to weak localization and the Pauli paramagnetic spin susceptibility."
716,Proton transfer dynamics control the mechanism of O,2016-05-02,"Many chemical and biological processes involve the transfer of both protons and electrons. The complex mechanistic details of these proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions require independent control of both electron and proton transfer. In this report, we make use of lipid-modified electrodes to modulate proton transport to a Cu-based catalyst that facilitates the O2 reduction reaction (ORR), a PCET process important in fuel cells and O2 reduction enzymes. By quantitatively controlling the kinetics of proton transport to the catalyst, we demonstrate that undesired side products such as H2O2 and O2− arise from a mismatch between proton and electron transfer rates. Whereas fast proton kinetics induce H2O2 formation and sluggish proton flux produces O2−, proton transfer rates commensurate with O–O bond breaking rates ensure that only the desired H2O product forms. This fundamental insight aids in the development of a comprehensive framework for understanding the ORR and PCET processes in general."
717,Tuning hardness in calcite by incorporation of amino acids,2016-05-02,"Structural biominerals are inorganic/organic composites that exhibit remarkable mechanical properties. However, the structure–property relationships of even the simplest building unit—mineral single crystals containing embedded macromolecules—remain poorly understood. Here, by means of a model biomineral made from calcite single crystals containing glycine (0–7 mol%) or aspartic acid (0–4 mol%), we elucidate the origin of the superior hardness of biogenic calcite. We analysed lattice distortions in these model crystals by using X-ray diffraction and molecular dynamics simulations, and by means of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance show that the amino acids are incorporated as individual molecules. We also demonstrate that nanoindentation hardness increased with amino acid content, reaching values equivalent to their biogenic counterparts. A dislocation pinning model reveals that the enhanced hardness is determined by the force required to cut covalent bonds in the molecules."
718,Polymer nanofilms with enhanced microporosity by interfacial polymerization,2016-05-02,"Highly permeable and selective membranes are desirable for energy-efficient gas and liquid separations. Microporous organic polymers have attracted significant attention in this respect owing to their high porosity, permeability and molecular selectivity. However, it remains challenging to fabricate selective polymer membranes with controlled microporosity that are stable in solvents. Here we report a new approach to designing crosslinked, rigid polymer nanofilms with enhanced microporosity by manipulating the molecular structure. Ultrathin polyarylate nanofilms with thickness down to 20 nm are formed in situ by interfacial polymerization. Enhanced microporosity and higher interconnectivity of intermolecular network voids, as rationalized by molecular simulations, are achieved by using contorted monomers for the interfacial polymerization. Composite membranes comprising polyarylate nanofilms with enhanced microporosity fabricated in situ on crosslinked polyimide ultrafiltration membranes show outstanding separation performance in organic solvents, with up to two orders of magnitude higher solvent permeance than membranes fabricated with nanofilms made from non-contorted planar monomers."
719,Promoting solution phase discharge in Li–O,2016-04-25,"On discharge, the Li–O2 battery can form a Li2O2 film on the cathode surface, leading to low capacities, low rates and early cell death, or it can form Li2O2 particles in solution, leading to high capacities at relatively high rates and avoiding early cell death. Achieving discharge in solution is important and may be encouraged by the use of high donor or acceptor number solvents or salts that dissolve the LiO2 intermediate involved in the formation of Li2O2. However, the characteristics that make high donor or acceptor number solvents good (for example, high polarity) result in them being unstable towards LiO2 or Li2O2. Here we demonstrate that introduction of the additive 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DBBQ) promotes solution phase formation of Li2O2 in low-polarity and weakly solvating electrolyte solutions. Importantly, it does so while simultaneously suppressing direct reduction to Li2O2 on the cathode surface, which would otherwise lead to Li2O2 film growth and premature cell death. It also halves the overpotential during discharge, increases the capacity 80- to 100-fold and enables rates >1 mA cmareal−2 for cathodes with capacities of >4 mAh cmareal−2. The DBBQ additive operates by a new mechanism that avoids the reactive LiO2 intermediate in solution."
720,Elimination of charge carrier trapping in diluted semiconductors,2016-04-25,"In 1962, Mark and Helfrich demonstrated that the current in a semiconductor containing traps is reduced by N/Ntr, with N the amount of transport sites, Nt the amount of traps and r a number that depends on the trap energy distribution. For r > 1, the possibility opens that trapping effects can be nearly eliminated when N and Nt are simultaneously reduced. Solution-processed conjugated polymers are an excellent model system to test this hypothesis, because they can be easily diluted by blending them with a high-bandgap semiconductor. We demonstrate that in conjugated polymer blends with 10% active semiconductor and 90% high-bandgap host, the typical strong electron trapping can be effectively eliminated. As a result we were able to fabricate polymer light-emitting diodes with balanced electron and hole transport and reduced non-radiative trap-assisted recombination, leading to a doubling of their efficiency at nearly ten times lower material costs."
721,Reconstructing solute-induced phase transformations within individual nanocrystals,2016-04-18,"Strain and defects can significantly impact the performance of functional nanomaterials. This effect is well exemplified by energy storage systems, in which structural changes such as volume expansion and defect generation govern the phase transformations associated with charging and discharging. The rational design of next-generation storage materials therefore depends crucially on understanding the correlation between the structure of individual nanoparticles and their solute uptake and release. Here, we experimentally reconstruct the spatial distribution of hydride phases within individual palladium nanocrystals during hydrogen absorption, using a combination of electron spectroscopy, dark-field imaging, and electron diffraction in an environmental transmission electron microscope. We show that single-crystalline cubes and pyramids exhibit a uniform hydrogen distribution at equilibrium, whereas multiply twinned icosahedra exclude hydrogen from regions of high compressive strains. Our technique offers unprecedented insight into nanoscale phase transformations in reactive environments and can be extended to a variety of functional nanomaterials."
722,Inverse spin Hall effect from pulsed spin current in organic semiconductors with tunable spin–orbit coupling,2016-04-18,"Exploration of spin currents in organic semiconductors (OSECs) induced by resonant microwave absorption in ferromagnetic substrates is appealing for potential spintronics applications. Owing to the inherently weak spin–orbit coupling (SOC) of OSECs, their inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) response is very subtle; limited by the microwave power applicable under continuous-wave (cw) excitation. Here we introduce a novel approach for generating significant ISHE signals in OSECs using pulsed ferromagnetic resonance, where the ISHE is two to three orders of magnitude larger compared to cw excitation. This strong ISHE enables us to investigate a variety of OSECs ranging from π-conjugated polymers with strong SOC that contain intrachain platinum atoms, to weak SOC polymers, to C60 films, where the SOC is predominantly caused by the curvature of the molecule’s surface. The pulsed-ISHE technique offers a robust route for efficient injection and detection schemes of spin currents at room temperature, and paves the way for spin orbitronics in plastic materials."
723,Bioresorbable silicon electronics for transient spatiotemporal mapping of electrical activity from the cerebral cortex,2016-04-18,"Bioresorbable silicon electronics technology offers unprecedented opportunities to deploy advanced implantable monitoring systems that eliminate risks, cost and discomfort associated with surgical extraction. Applications include postoperative monitoring and transient physiologic recording after percutaneous or minimally invasive placement of vascular, cardiac, orthopaedic, neural or other devices. We present an embodiment of these materials in both passive and actively addressed arrays of bioresorbable silicon electrodes with multiplexing capabilities, which record in vivo electrophysiological signals from the cortical surface and the subgaleal space. The devices detect normal physiologic and epileptiform activity, both in acute and chronic recordings. Comparative studies show sensor performance comparable to standard clinical systems and reduced tissue reactivity relative to conventional clinical electrocorticography (ECoG) electrodes. This technology offers general applicability in neural interfaces, with additional potential utility in treatment of disorders where transient monitoring and modulation of physiologic function, implant integrity and tissue recovery or regeneration are required."
724,Quantum chaos and breaking of all anti-unitary symmetries in Rydberg excitons,2016-04-11,"Symmetries are the underlying principles of fundamental interactions in nature. Chaos in a quantum system may emerge from breaking these symmetries. Compared to vacuum, crystals are attractive for studying quantum chaos, as they not only break spatial isotropy, but also lead to novel quasiparticles with modified interactions. Here we study yellow Rydberg excitons in cuprous oxide which couple strongly to the vacuum light field and interact significantly with crystal phonons, leading to inversion symmetry breaking. In a magnetic field, time-reversal symmetry is also broken and the exciton states show a complex splitting pattern, resulting in quadratic level repulsion for small splittings. In contrast to atomic chaotic systems in a magnetic field, which show only a linear level repulsion, this is a signature of a system where all anti-unitary symmetries are broken simultaneously. This behaviour can otherwise be found only for the electro-weak interaction or engineered billiards."
725,Confined linear carbon chains as a route to bulk carbyne,2016-04-04,"Strong chemical activity and extreme instability in ambient conditions characterize carbyne, an infinite sp1 hybridized carbon chain. As a result, much less has been explored about carbyne as compared to other carbon allotropes such as fullerenes, nanotubes and graphene. Although end-capping groups can be used to stabilize carbon chains, length limitations are still a barrier for production, and even more so for application. We report a method for the bulk production of long acetylenic linear carbon chains protected by thin double-walled carbon nanotubes. The synthesis of very long arrangements is confirmed by a combination of transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and (near-field) resonance Raman spectroscopy. Our results establish a route for the bulk production of exceptionally long and stable chains composed of more than 6,000 carbon atoms, representing an elegant forerunner towards the final goal of carbyne’s bulk production."
726,Proximate Kitaev quantum spin liquid behaviour in a honeycomb magnet,2016-04-04,"Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) are topological states of matter exhibiting remarkable properties such as the capacity to protect quantum information from decoherence. Whereas their featureless ground states have precluded their straightforward experimental identification, excited states are more revealing and particularly interesting owing to the emergence of fundamentally new excitations such as Majorana fermions. Ideal probes of these excitations are inelastic neutron scattering experiments. These we report here for a ruthenium-based material, α-RuCl3, continuing a major search (so far concentrated on iridium materials) for realizations of the celebrated Kitaev honeycomb topological QSL. Our measurements confirm the requisite strong spin–orbit coupling and low-temperature magnetic order matching predictions proximate to the QSL. We find stacking faults, inherent to the highly two-dimensional nature of the material, resolve an outstanding puzzle. Crucially, dynamical response measurements above interlayer energy scales are naturally accounted for in terms of deconfinement physics expected for QSLs. Comparing these with recent dynamical calculations involving gauge flux excitations and Majorana fermions of the pure Kitaev model, we propose the excitation spectrum of α-RuCl3 as a prime candidate for fractionalized Kitaev physics."
727,Extreme sensitivity biosensing platform based on hyperbolic metamaterials,2016-03-28,"Optical sensor technology offers significant opportunities in the field of medical research and clinical diagnostics, particularly for the detection of small numbers of molecules in highly diluted solutions. Several methods have been developed for this purpose, including label-free plasmonic biosensors based on metamaterials. However, the detection of lower-molecular-weight (<500 Da) biomolecules in highly diluted solutions is still a challenging issue owing to their lower polarizability. In this context, we have developed a miniaturized plasmonic biosensor platform based on a hyperbolic metamaterial that can support highly confined bulk plasmon guided modes over a broad wavelength range from visible to near infrared. By exciting these modes using a grating-coupling technique, we achieved different extreme sensitivity modes with a maximum of 30,000 nm per refractive index unit (RIU) and a record figure of merit (FOM) of 590. We report the ability of the metamaterial platform to detect ultralow-molecular-weight (244 Da) biomolecules at picomolar concentrations using a standard affinity model streptavidin–biotin."
728,Kinetics of the self-assembly of nanocrystal superlattices measured by real-time ,2016-03-21,"On solvent evaporation, non-interacting monodisperse colloidal particles self-assemble into a close-packed superlattice. Although the initial and final states can be readily characterized, little is known about the dynamic transformation from colloid to superlattice. Here, by using in situ grazing-incidence X-ray scattering, we tracked the self-assembly of lead sulfide nanocrystals in real time. Following the first appearance of an ordered arrangement, the superlattice underwent uniaxial contraction and collective rotation as it approached its final body-centred cubic structure. The nanocrystals became crystallographically aligned early in the overall self-assembly process, showing that nanocrystal ordering occurs on a faster timescale than superlattice densification. Our findings demonstrate that synchrotron X-ray scattering is a viable method for studying self-assembly in its native environment, with ample time resolution to extract kinetic rates and observe intermediate configurations. The method could be used for real-time direction of self-assembly processes and to better understand the forces governing self-organization of soft materials."
729,Paramagnetic fluorinated nanoemulsions for sensitive cellular fluorine-19 magnetic resonance imaging,2016-03-14,"Fluorine-19 magnetic resonance imaging (19F MRI) probes enable quantitative in vivo detection of cell therapies and inflammatory cells. Here, we describe the formulation of perfluorocarbon-based nanoemulsions with improved sensitivity for cellular MRI. Reduction of the 19F spin–lattice relaxation time (T1) enables rapid imaging and an improved signal-to-noise ratio, thereby improving cell detection sensitivity. We synthesized metal-binding β-diketones conjugated to linear perfluoropolyether (PFPE), formulated these fluorinated ligands as aqueous nanoemulsions, and then metallated them with various transition and lanthanide ions in the fluorous phase. Iron(III) tris-β-diketonate (‘FETRIS’) nanoemulsions with PFPE have low cytotoxicity (<20%) and superior MRI properties. Moreover, the 19F T1 can readily be reduced by an order of magnitude and tuned by stoichiometric modulation of the iron concentration. The resulting 19F MRI detection sensitivity is enhanced by three- to fivefold over previously used tracers at 11.7 T, and is predicted to increase by at least eightfold at the clinical field strength of 3 T."
730,Directed migration of cancer cells guided by the graded texture of the underlying matrix,2016-03-14,"Living cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) can exhibit complex interactions that define key developmental, physiological and pathological processes. Here, we report a new type of directed migration—which we term ‘topotaxis’—guided by the gradient of the nanoscale topographic features in the cells’ ECM environment. We show that the direction of topotaxis is reflective of the effective cell stiffness, and that it depends on the balance of the ECM-triggered signalling pathways PI(3)K–Akt and ROCK–MLCK. In melanoma cancer cells, this balance can be altered by different ECM inputs, pharmacological perturbations or genetic alterations, particularly a loss of PTEN in aggressive melanoma cells. We conclude that topotaxis is a product of the material properties of cells and the surrounding ECM, and propose that the invasive capacity of many cancers may depend broadly on topotactic responses, providing a potentially attractive mechanism for controlling invasive and metastatic behaviour."
731,Engineered hybrid cardiac patches with multifunctional electronics for online monitoring and regulation of tissue function,2016-03-14,"In cardiac tissue engineering approaches to treat myocardial infarction, cardiac cells are seeded within three-dimensional porous scaffolds to create functional cardiac patches. However, current cardiac patches do not allow for online monitoring and reporting of engineered-tissue performance, and do not interfere to deliver signals for patch activation or to enable its integration with the host. Here, we report an engineered cardiac patch that integrates cardiac cells with flexible, freestanding electronics and a 3D nanocomposite scaffold. The patch exhibited robust electronic properties, enabling the recording of cellular electrical activities and the on-demand provision of electrical stimulation for synchronizing cell contraction. We also show that electroactive polymers containing biological factors can be deposited on designated electrodes to release drugs in the patch microenvironment on demand. We expect that the integration of complex electronics within cardiac patches will eventually provide therapeutic control and regulation of cardiac function."
732,Coordination polymer structure and revisited hydrogen evolution catalytic mechanism for amorphous molybdenum sulfide,2016-03-14,"Molybdenum sulfides are very attractive noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water. The atomic structure and identity of the catalytically active sites have been well established for crystalline molybdenum disulfide (c-MoS2) but not for amorphous molybdenum sulfide (a-MoSx), which exhibits significantly higher HER activity compared to its crystalline counterpart. Here we show that HER-active a-MoSx, prepared either as nanoparticles or as films, is a molecular-based coordination polymer consisting of discrete [Mo3S13]2− building blocks. Of the three terminal disulfide (S22−) ligands within these clusters, two are shared to form the polymer chain. The third one remains free and generates molybdenum hydride moieties as the active site under H2 evolution conditions. Such a molecular structure therefore provides a basis for revisiting the mechanism of a-MoSx catalytic activity, as well as explaining some of its special properties such as reductive activation and corrosion. Our findings open up new avenues for the rational optimization of this HER electrocatalyst as an alternative to platinum."
733,Tuning magnetic anisotropy by interfacially engineering the oxygen coordination environment in a transition metal oxide,2016-03-07,"Strong correlations between electrons, spins and lattices—stemming from strong hybridization between transition metal d and oxygen p orbitals—are responsible for the functional properties of transition metal oxides. Artificial oxide heterostructures with chemically abrupt interfaces provide a platform for engineering bonding geometries that lead to emergent phenomena. Here we demonstrate the control of the oxygen coordination environment of the perovskite, SrRuO3, by heterostructuring it with Ca0.5Sr0.5TiO3 (0–4 monolayers thick) grown on a GdScO3 substrate. We found that a Ru–O–Ti bond angle of the SrRuO3 /Ca0.5Sr0.5TiO3 interface can be engineered by layer-by-layer control of the Ca0.5Sr0.5TiO3 layer thickness, and that the engineered Ru–O–Ti bond angle not only stabilizes a Ru–O–Ru bond angle never seen in bulk SrRuO3, but also tunes the magnetic anisotropy in the entire SrRuO3 layer. The results demonstrate that interface engineering of the oxygen coordination environment allows one to control additional degrees of freedom in functional oxide heterostructures."
734,Biodegradable scaffold with built-in vasculature for organ-on-a-chip engineering and direct surgical anastomosis,2016-03-07,"We report the fabrication of a scaffold (hereafter referred to as AngioChip) that supports the assembly of parenchymal cells on a mechanically tunable matrix surrounding a perfusable, branched, three-dimensional microchannel network coated with endothelial cells. The design of AngioChip decouples the material choices for the engineered vessel network and for cell seeding in the parenchyma, enabling extensive remodelling while maintaining an open-vessel lumen. The incorporation of nanopores and micro-holes in the vessel walls enhances permeability, and permits intercellular crosstalk and extravasation of monocytes and endothelial cells on biomolecular stimulation. We also show that vascularized hepatic tissues and cardiac tissues engineered by using AngioChips process clinically relevant drugs delivered through the vasculature, and that millimetre-thick cardiac tissues can be engineered in a scalable manner. Moreover, we demonstrate that AngioChip cardiac tissues implanted with direct surgical anastomosis to the femoral vessels of rat hindlimbs establish immediate blood perfusion."
735,Controlled lateral anisotropy in correlated manganite heterostructures by interface-engineered oxygen octahedral coupling,2016-03-07,"Controlled in-plane rotation of the magnetic easy axis in manganite heterostructures by tailoring the interface oxygen network could allow the development of correlated oxide-based magnetic tunnelling junctions with non-collinear magnetization, with possible practical applications as miniaturized high-switching-speed magnetic random access memory (MRAM) devices. Here, we demonstrate how to manipulate magnetic and electronic anisotropic properties in manganite heterostructures by engineering the oxygen network on the unit-cell level. The strong oxygen octahedral coupling is found to transfer the octahedral rotation, present in the NdGaO3 (NGO) substrate, to the La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (LSMO) film in the interface region. This causes an unexpected realignment of the magnetic easy axis along the short axis of the LSMO unit cell as well as the presence of a giant anisotropic transport in these ultrathin LSMO films. As a result we possess control of the lateral magnetic and electronic anisotropies by atomic-scale design of the oxygen octahedral rotation."
736, hydrodynamic spectroscopy for structure characterization of porous energy storage electrodes,2016-02-29,"A primary atomic-scale effect accompanying Li-ion insertion into rechargeable battery electrodes is a significant intercalation-induced change of the unit cell volume of the crystalline material. This generates a variety of secondary multiscale dimensional changes and causes a deterioration in the energy storage performance stability. Although traditional in situ height-sensing techniques (atomic force microscopy or electrochemical dilatometry) are able to sense electrode thickness changes at a nanometre scale, they are much less informative concerning intercalation-induced changes of the porous electrode structure at a mesoscopic scale. Based on a electrochemical quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring on multiple overtone orders, herein we introduce an in situ hydrodynamic spectroscopic method for porous electrode structure characterization. This new method will enable future developments and applications in the fields of battery and supercapacitor research, especially for diagnostics of viscoelastic properties of binders for composite electrodes and probing the micromechanical stability of their internal electrode porous structure and interfaces."
737,Charge transport and localization in atomically coherent quantum dot solids,2016-02-22,"Epitaxial attachment of quantum dots into ordered superlattices enables the synthesis of quasi-two-dimensional materials that theoretically exhibit features such as Dirac cones and topological states, and have major potential for unprecedented optoelectronic devices. Initial studies found that disorder in these structures causes localization of electrons within a few lattice constants, and highlight the critical need for precise structural characterization and systematic assessment of the effects of disorder on transport. Here we fabricated superlattices with the quantum dots registered to within a single atomic bond length (limited by the polydispersity of the quantum dot building blocks), but missing a fraction (20%) of the epitaxial connections. Calculations of the electronic structure including the measured disorder account for the electron localization inferred from transport measurements. The calculations also show that improvement of the epitaxial connections will lead to completely delocalized electrons and may enable the observation of the remarkable properties predicted for these materials."
738,Lattice engineering through nanoparticle–DNA frameworks,2016-02-22,"Advances in self-assembly over the past decade have demonstrated that nano- and microscale particles can be organized into a large diversity of ordered three-dimensional (3D) lattices. However, the ability to generate different desired lattice types from the same set of particles remains challenging. Here, we show that nanoparticles can be assembled into crystalline and open 3D frameworks by connecting them through designed DNA-based polyhedral frames. The geometrical shapes of the frames, combined with the DNA-assisted binding properties of their vertices, facilitate the well-defined topological connections between particles in accordance with frame geometry. With this strategy, different crystallographic lattices using the same particles can be assembled by introduction of the corresponding DNA polyhedral frames. This approach should facilitate the rational assembly of nanoscale lattices through the design of the unit cell."
739,Robust reconfigurable electromagnetic pathways within a photonic topological insulator,2016-02-22,"The discovery of topological photonic states has revolutionized our understanding of electromagnetic propagation and scattering. Endowed with topological robustness, photonic edge modes are not reflected from structural imperfections and disordered regions. Here we demonstrate robust propagation along reconfigurable pathways defined by synthetic gauge fields within a topological photonic metacrystal. The flow of microwave radiation in helical edge modes following arbitrary contours of the synthetic gauge field between bianisotropic metacrystal domains is unimpeded. This is demonstrated in measurements of the spectrum of transmission and time delay along the topological domain walls. These results provide a framework for freely steering electromagnetic radiation within photonic structures."
740,Magnetization switching by spin–orbit torque in an antiferromagnet–ferromagnet bilayer system,2016-02-15,"Spin–orbit torque (SOT)-induced magnetization switching shows promise for realizing ultrafast and reliable spintronics devices. Bipolar switching of the perpendicular magnetization by the SOT is achieved under an in-plane magnetic field collinear with an applied current. Typical structures studied so far comprise a nonmagnet/ferromagnet (NM/FM) bilayer, where the spin Hall effect in the NM is responsible for the switching. Here we show that an antiferromagnet/ferromagnet (AFM/FM) bilayer system also exhibits a SOT large enough to switch the magnetization of the FM. In this material system, thanks to the exchange bias of the AFM, we observe the switching in the absence of an applied field by using an antiferromagnetic PtMn and ferromagnetic Co/Ni multilayer with a perpendicular easy axis. Furthermore, tailoring the stack achieves a memristor-like behaviour where a portion of the reversed magnetization can be controlled in an analogue manner. The AFM/FM system is thus a promising building block for SOT devices as well as providing an attractive pathway towards neuromorphic computing."
741,Orbital symmetry of charge-density-wave order in La,2016-02-15,"Recent theories of charge-density-wave (CDW) order in high-temperature superconductors have predicted a primarily d CDW orbital symmetry. Here, we report on the orbital symmetry of CDW order in the canonical cuprate superconductors La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 (LBCO) and YBa2Cu3O6.67 (YBCO), using resonant soft X-ray scattering and a model mapped to the CDW orbital symmetry. From measurements sensitive to the O sublattice, we conclude that LBCO has predominantly s′ CDW orbital symmetry, in contrast to the d orbital symmetry recently reported in other cuprates. Furthermore, we show for YBCO that the CDW orbital symmetry differs along the a and b crystal axes and that these both differ from LBCO. This work highlights CDW orbital symmetry as an additional key property that distinguishes the different cuprate families. We discuss how the CDW symmetry may be related to the ‘1/8–anomaly’ and to static spin ordering."
742,Highly mobile ferroelastic domain walls in compositionally graded ferroelectric thin films,2016-02-15,"Domains and domain walls are critical in determining the response of ferroelectrics, and the ability to controllably create, annihilate, or move domains is essential to enable a range of next-generation devices. Whereas electric-field control has been demonstrated for ferroelectric 180° domain walls, similar control of ferroelastic domains has not been achieved. Here, using controlled composition and strain gradients, we demonstrate deterministic control of ferroelastic domains that are rendered highly mobile in a controlled and reversible manner. Through a combination of thin-film growth, transmission-electron-microscopy-based nanobeam diffraction and nanoscale band-excitation switching spectroscopy, we show that strain gradients in compositionally graded PbZr1−xTixO3 heterostructures stabilize needle-like ferroelastic domains that terminate inside the film. These needle-like domains are highly labile in the out-of-plane direction under applied electric fields, producing a locally enhanced piezoresponse. This work demonstrates the efficacy of novel modes of epitaxy in providing new modalities of domain engineering and potential for as-yet-unrealized nanoscale functional devices."
743,Structured light enables biomimetic swimming and versatile locomotion of photoresponsive soft microrobots,2016-02-15,"Microorganisms move in challenging environments by periodic changes in body shape. In contrast, current artificial microrobots cannot actively deform, exhibiting at best passive bending under external fields. Here, by taking advantage of the wireless, scalable and spatiotemporally selective capabilities that light allows, we show that soft microrobots consisting of photoactive liquid-crystal elastomers can be driven by structured monochromatic light to perform sophisticated biomimetic motions. We realize continuum yet selectively addressable artificial microswimmers that generate travelling-wave motions to self-propel without external forces or torques, as well as microrobots capable of versatile locomotion behaviours on demand. Both theoretical predictions and experimental results confirm that multiple gaits, mimicking either symplectic or antiplectic metachrony of ciliate protozoa, can be achieved with single microswimmers. The principle of using structured light can be extended to other applications that require microscale actuation with sophisticated spatiotemporal coordination for advanced microrobotic technologies."
744,Conductance saturation in a series of highly transmitting molecular junctions,2016-02-01,"Revealing the mechanisms of electronic transport through metal–molecule interfaces is of central importance for a variety of molecule-based devices. A key method for understanding these mechanisms is based on the study of conductance versus molecule length in molecular junctions. However, previous works focused on transport governed either by coherent tunnelling or hopping, both at low conductance. Here, we study the upper limit of conductance across metal–molecule–metal interfaces. Using highly conducting single-molecule junctions based on oligoacenes with increasing length, we find that the conductance saturates at an upper limit where it is independent of molecule length. With the aid of two prototype systems, in which the molecules are contacted by either Ag or Pt electrodes, we find two different possible origins for conductance saturation. The results are explained by an intuitive model, backed by ab initio calculations. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms that constrain the conductance of metal–molecule interfaces at the high-transmission limit."
745,Realistic molecular model of kerogen’s nanostructure,2016-02-01,"Despite kerogen’s importance as the organic backbone for hydrocarbon production from source rocks such as gas shale, the interplay between kerogen’s chemistry, morphology and mechanics remains unexplored. As the environmental impact of shale gas rises, identifying functional relations between its geochemical, transport, elastic and fracture properties from realistic molecular models of kerogens becomes all the more important. Here, by using a hybrid experimental–simulation method, we propose a panel of realistic molecular models of mature and immature kerogens that provide a detailed picture of kerogen’s nanostructure without considering the presence of clays and other minerals in shales. We probe the models’ strengths and limitations, and show that they predict essential features amenable to experimental validation, including pore distribution, vibrational density of states and stiffness. We also show that kerogen’s maturation, which manifests itself as an increase in the sp2/sp3 hybridization ratio, entails a crossover from plastic-to-brittle rupture mechanisms."
746,Approaching theoretical strength in glassy carbon nanolattices,2016-02-01,"The strength of lightweight mechanical metamaterials, which aim to exploit material-strengthening size effects by their microscale lattice structure, has been limited by the resolution of three-dimensional lithography technologies and their restriction to mainly polymer resins. Here, we demonstrate that pyrolysis of polymeric microlattices can overcome these limitations and create ultra-strong glassy carbon nanolattices with single struts shorter than 1 μm and diameters as small as 200 nm. They represent the smallest lattice structures yet produced—achieved by an 80% shrinkage of the polymer during pyrolysis—and exhibit material strengths of up to 3 GPa, corresponding approximately to the theoretical strength of glassy carbon. The strength-to-density ratios of the nanolattices are six times higher than those of reported microlattices. With a honeycomb topology, effective strengths of 1.2 GPa at 0.6 g cm−3 are achieved. Diamond is the only bulk material with a notably higher strength-to-density ratio."
747,Programming curvature using origami tessellations,2016-01-25,"Origami describes rules for creating folded structures from patterns on a flat sheet, but does not prescribe how patterns can be designed to fit target shapes. Here, starting from the simplest periodic origami pattern that yields one-degree-of-freedom collapsible structures—we show that scale-independent elementary geometric constructions and constrained optimization algorithms can be used to determine spatially modulated patterns that yield approximations to given surfaces of constant or varying curvature. Paper models confirm the feasibility of our calculations. We also assess the difficulty of realizing these geometric structures by quantifying the energetic barrier that separates the metastable flat and folded states. Moreover, we characterize the trade-off between the accuracy to which the pattern conforms to the target surface, and the effort associated with creating finer folds. Our approach enables the tailoring of origami patterns to drape complex surfaces independent of absolute scale, as well as the quantification of the energetic and material cost of doing so."
748,Interfacial electronic effects control the reaction selectivity of platinum catalysts,2016-01-25,"Tuning the electronic structure of heterogeneous metal catalysts has emerged as an effective strategy to optimize their catalytic activities. By preparing ethylenediamine-coated ultrathin platinum nanowires as a model catalyst, here we demonstrate an interfacial electronic effect induced by simple organic modifications to control the selectivity of metal nanocatalysts during catalytic hydrogenation. This we apply to produce thermodynamically unfavourable but industrially important compounds, with ultrathin platinum nanowires exhibiting an unexpectedly high selectivity for the production of N-hydroxylanilines, through the partial hydrogenation of nitroaromatics. Mechanistic studies reveal that the electron donation from ethylenediamine makes the surface of platinum nanowires highly electron rich. During catalysis, such an interfacial electronic effect makes the catalytic surface favour the adsorption of electron-deficient reactants over electron-rich substrates (that is, N-hydroxylanilines), thus preventing full hydrogenation. More importantly, this interfacial electronic effect, achieved through simple organic modifications, may now be used for the optimization of commercial platinum catalysts."
749,Energy landscapes and functions of supramolecular systems,2016-01-18,"By means of two supramolecular systems—peptide amphiphiles engaged in hydrogen-bonded β-sheets, and chromophore amphiphiles driven to assemble by π-orbital overlaps—we show that the minima in the energy landscapes of supramolecular systems are defined by electrostatic repulsion and the ability of the dominant attractive forces to trap molecules in thermodynamically unfavourable configurations. These competing interactions can be selectively switched on and off, with the order of doing so determining the position of the final product in the energy landscape. Within the same energy landscape, the peptide-amphiphile system forms a thermodynamically favoured product characterized by long bundled fibres that promote biological cell adhesion and survival, and a metastable product characterized by short monodisperse fibres that interfere with adhesion and can lead to cell death. Our findings suggest that, in supramolecular systems, functions and energy landscapes are linked, superseding the more traditional connection between molecular design and function."
750,Genesis and growth of extracellular-vesicle-derived microcalcification in atherosclerotic plaques,2016-01-11,"Clinical evidence links arterial calcification and cardiovascular risk. Finite-element modelling of the stress distribution within atherosclerotic plaques has suggested that subcellular microcalcifications in the fibrous cap may promote material failure of the plaque, but that large calcifications can stabilize it. Yet the physicochemical mechanisms underlying such mineral formation and growth in atheromata remain unknown. Here, by using three-dimensional collagen hydrogels that mimic structural features of the atherosclerotic fibrous cap, and high-resolution microscopic and spectroscopic analyses of both the hydrogels and of calcified human plaques, we demonstrate that calcific mineral formation and maturation results from a series of events involving the aggregation of calcifying extracellular vesicles, and the formation of microcalcifications and ultimately large calcification areas. We also show that calcification morphology and the plaque’s collagen content—two determinants of atherosclerotic plaque stability—are interlinked."
751,Defined three-dimensional microenvironments boost induction of pluripotency,2016-01-11,"Since the discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), numerous approaches have been explored to improve the original protocol, which is based on a two-dimensional (2D) cell-culture system. Surprisingly, nothing is known about the effect of a more biologically faithful 3D environment on somatic-cell reprogramming. Here, we report a systematic analysis of how reprogramming of somatic cells occurs within engineered 3D extracellular matrices. By modulating microenvironmental stiffness, degradability and biochemical composition, we have identified a previously unknown role for biophysical effectors in the promotion of iPSC generation. We find that the physical cell confinement imposed by the 3D microenvironment boosts reprogramming through an accelerated mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and increased epigenetic remodelling. We conclude that 3D microenvironmental signals act synergistically with reprogramming transcription factors to increase somatic plasticity."
752,Reconfigurable chiroptical nanocomposites with chirality transfer from the macro- to the nanoscale,2016-01-04,"Nanostructures with chiral geometries exhibit strong polarization rotation. However, achieving reversible modulation of chirality and polarization rotation in device-friendly solid-state films is difficult for rigid materials. Here, we describe nanocomposites, made by conformally coating twisted elastic substrates with films assembled layer-by-layer from plasmonic nanocolloids, whose nanoscale geometry and rotatory optical activity can be reversibly reconfigured and cyclically modulated by macroscale stretching, with up to tenfold concomitant increases in ellipticity. We show that the chiroptical activity at 660 nm of gold nanoparticle composites is associated with circular extinction from linear effects. The polarization rotation at 550 nm originates from the chirality of nanoparticle chains with an S-like shape that exhibit a non-planar buckled geometry, with the handedness of the substrate’s macroscale twist determining the handedness of the S-like chains. Chiroptical effects at the nexus of mechanics, excitonics and plasmonics open new operational principles for optical and optoelectronic devices from nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes and other nanoscale components."
753,Microstructural heterogeneity directs micromechanics and mechanobiology in native and engineered fibrocartilage,2016-01-04,"Treatment strategies to address pathologies of fibrocartilaginous tissue are in part limited by an incomplete understanding of structure–function relationships in these load-bearing tissues. There is therefore a pressing need to develop micro-engineered tissue platforms that can recreate the highly inhomogeneous tissue microstructures that are known to influence mechanotransductive processes in normal and diseased tissue. Here, we report the quantification of proteoglycan-rich microdomains in developing, ageing and diseased fibrocartilaginous tissues, and the impact of these microdomains on endogenous cell responses to physiologic deformation within a native-tissue context. We also developed a method to generate heterogeneous tissue-engineered constructs (hetTECs) with non-fibrous proteoglycan-rich microdomains engineered into the fibrous structure, and show that these hetTECs match the microstructural, micromechanical and mechanobiological benchmarks of native tissue. Our tissue-engineered platform should facilitate the study of the mechanobiology of developing, homeostatic, degenerating and regenerating fibrous tissues."
754,Adsorption of water at the SrO surface of ruthenates,2015-12-21,"Although perovskite oxides hold promise in applications ranging from solid oxide fuel cells to catalysts, their surface chemistry is poorly understood at the molecular level. Here we follow the formation of the first monolayer of water at the (001) surfaces of Srn+1RunO3n+1 (n = 1, 2) using low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory. These layered perovskites cleave between neighbouring SrO planes, yielding almost ideal, rocksalt-like surfaces. An adsorbed monomer dissociates and forms a pair of hydroxide ions. The OH stemming from the original molecule stays trapped at Sr–Sr bridge positions, circling the surface OH with a measured activation energy of 187 ± 10 meV. At higher coverage, dimers of dissociated water assemble into one-dimensional chains and form a percolating network where water adsorbs molecularly in the gaps. Our work shows the limitations of applying surface chemistry concepts derived for binary rocksalt oxides to perovskites."
755,Water reduction by a p-GaInP,2015-12-21,"Producing hydrogen through solar water splitting requires the coverage of large land areas. Abundant metal-based molecular catalysts offer scalability, but only if they match noble metal activities. We report on a highly active p-GaInP2 photocathode protected through a 35-nm TiO2 layer functionalized by a cobaloxime molecular catalyst (GaInP2–TiO2–cobaloxime). This photoelectrode mediates H2 production with a current density of ∼9 mA cm−2 at a potential of 0 V versus RHE under 1-sun illumination at pH 13. The calculated turnover number for the catalyst during a 20-h period is 139,000, with an average turnover frequency of 1.9 s−1. Bare GaInP2 shows a rapid current decay, whereas the GaInP2–TiO2–cobaloxime electrode shows ≤5% loss over 20 min, comparable to a GaInP2–TiO2–Pt catalyst particle-modified interface. The activity and corrosion resistance of the GaInP2–TiO2–cobaloxime photocathode in basic solution is made possible by an atomic layer-deposited TiO2 and an attached cobaloxime catalyst."
756,Chemical vapour deposition of zeolitic imidazolate framework thin films,2015-12-14,"Integrating metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) in microelectronics has disruptive potential because of the unique properties of these microporous crystalline materials. Suitable film deposition methods are crucial to leverage MOFs in this field. Conventional solvent-based procedures, typically adapted from powder preparation routes, are incompatible with nanofabrication because of corrosion and contamination risks. We demonstrate a chemical vapour deposition process (MOF-CVD) that enables high-quality films of ZIF-8, a prototypical MOF material, with a uniform and controlled thickness, even on high-aspect-ratio features. Furthermore, we demonstrate how MOF-CVD enables previously inaccessible routes such as lift-off patterning and depositing MOF films on fragile features. The compatibility of MOF-CVD with existing infrastructure, both in research and production facilities, will greatly facilitate MOF integration in microelectronics. MOF-CVD is the first vapour-phase deposition method for any type of microporous crystalline network solid and marks a milestone in processing such materials."
757,Correlated metals as transparent conductors,2015-12-14,"The fundamental challenge for designing transparent conductors used in photovoltaics, displays and solid-state lighting is the ideal combination of high optical transparency and high electrical conductivity. Satisfying these competing demands is commonly achieved by increasing carrier concentration in a wide-bandgap semiconductor with low effective carrier mass through heavy doping, as in the case of tin-doped indium oxide (ITO). Here, an alternative design strategy for identifying high-conductivity, high-transparency metals is proposed, which relies on strong electron–electron interactions resulting in an enhancement in the carrier effective mass. This approach is experimentally verified using the correlated metals SrVO3 and CaVO3, which, despite their high carrier concentration (>2.2 × 1022 cm−3), have low screened plasma energies (<1.33 eV), and demonstrate excellent performance when benchmarked against ITO. A method is outlined to rapidly identify other candidates among correlated metals, and strategies are proposed to further enhance their performance, thereby opening up new avenues to develop transparent conductors."
758,Self-assembled RNA-triple-helix hydrogel scaffold for microRNA modulation in the tumour microenvironment,2015-12-07,"The therapeutic potential of miRNA (miR) in cancer is limited by the lack of efficient delivery vehicles. Here, we show that a self-assembled dual-colour RNA-triple-helix structure comprising two miRNAs—a miR mimic (tumour suppressor miRNA) and an antagomiR (oncomiR inhibitor)—provides outstanding capability to synergistically abrogate tumours. Conjugation of RNA triple helices to dendrimers allows the formation of stable triplex nanoparticles, which form an RNA-triple-helix adhesive scaffold upon interaction with dextran aldehyde, the latter able to chemically interact and adhere to natural tissue amines in the tumour. We also show that the self-assembled RNA-triple-helix conjugates remain functional in vitro and in vivo, and that they lead to nearly 90% levels of tumour shrinkage two weeks post-gel implantation in a triple-negative breast cancer mouse model. Our findings suggest that the RNA-triple-helix hydrogels can be used as an efficient anticancer platform to locally modulate the expression of endogenous miRs in cancer."
759,Metal–insulator transition in films of doped semiconductor nanocrystals,2015-11-30,"To fully deploy the potential of semiconductor nanocrystal films as low-cost electronic materials, a better understanding of the amount of dopants required to make their conductivity metallic is needed. In bulk semiconductors, the critical concentration of electrons at the metal–insulator transition is described by the Mott criterion. Here, we theoretically derive the critical concentration nc for films of heavily doped nanocrystals devoid of ligands at their surface and in direct contact with each other. In the accompanying experiments, we investigate the conduction mechanism in films of phosphorus-doped, ligand-free silicon nanocrystals. At the largest electron concentration achieved in our samples, which is half the predicted nc, we find that the localization length of hopping electrons is close to three times the nanocrystals diameter, indicating that the film approaches the metal–insulator transition."
760,Design of active and stable Co–Mo–S,2015-11-30,"Three of the fundamental catalytic limitations that have plagued the electrochemical production of hydrogen for decades still remain: low efficiency, short lifetime of catalysts and a lack of low-cost materials. Here, we address these three challenges by establishing and exploring an intimate functional link between the reactivity and stability of crystalline (CoS2 and MoS2) and amorphous (CoSx and MoSx) hydrogen evolution catalysts. We propose that Co2+ and Mo4+ centres promote the initial discharge of water (alkaline solutions) or hydronium ions (acid solutions). We establish that although CoSx materials are more active than MoSx they are also less stable, suggesting that the active sites are defects formed after dissolution of Co and Mo cations. By combining the higher activity of CoSx building blocks with the higher stability of MoSx units into a compact and robust CoMoSx chalcogel structure, we are able to design a low-cost alternative to noble metal catalysts for efficient electrocatalytic production of hydrogen in both alkaline and acidic environments."
761,Stress-stiffening-mediated stem-cell commitment switch in soft responsive hydrogels,2015-11-30,"Bulk matrix stiffness has emerged as a key mechanical cue in stem cell differentiation. Here, we show that the commitment and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells encapsulated in physiologically soft (∼0.2–0.4 kPa), fully synthetic polyisocyanopeptide-based three-dimensional (3D) matrices that mimic the stiffness of adult stem cell niches and show biopolymer-like stress stiffening, can be readily switched from adipogenesis to osteogenesis by changing only the onset of stress stiffening. This mechanical behaviour can be tuned by simply altering the material’s polymer length whilst maintaining stiffness and ligand density. Our findings introduce stress stiffening as an important parameter that governs stem cell fate in a 3D microenvironment, and reveal a correlation between the onset of stiffening and the expression of the microtubule-associated protein DCAMKL1, thus implicating DCAMKL1 in a stress-stiffening-mediated, mechanotransduction pathway that involves microtubule dynamics in stem cell osteogenesis."
762,Hydrogels with tunable stress relaxation regulate stem cell fate and activity,2015-11-30,"Natural extracellular matrices (ECMs) are viscoelastic and exhibit stress relaxation. However, hydrogels used as synthetic ECMs for three-dimensional (3D) culture are typically elastic. Here, we report a materials approach to tune the rate of stress relaxation of hydrogels for 3D culture, independently of the hydrogel’s initial elastic modulus, degradation, and cell-adhesion-ligand density. We find that cell spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are all enhanced in cells cultured in gels with faster relaxation. Strikingly, MSCs form a mineralized, collagen-1-rich matrix similar to bone in rapidly relaxing hydrogels with an initial elastic modulus of 17 kPa. We also show that the effects of stress relaxation are mediated by adhesion-ligand binding, actomyosin contractility and mechanical clustering of adhesion ligands. Our findings highlight stress relaxation as a key characteristic of cell–ECM interactions and as an important design parameter of biomaterials for cell culture."
763,A small-molecule dye for NIR-II imaging,2015-11-23,"Fluorescent imaging of biological systems in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) can probe tissue at centimetre depths and achieve micrometre-scale resolution at depths of millimetres. Unfortunately, all current NIR-II fluorophores are excreted slowly and are largely retained within the reticuloendothelial system, making clinical translation nearly impossible. Here, we report a rapidly excreted NIR-II fluorophore (∼90% excreted through the kidneys within 24 h) based on a synthetic 970-Da organic molecule (CH1055). The fluorophore outperformed indocyanine green (ICG)—a clinically approved NIR-I dye—in resolving mouse lymphatic vasculature and sentinel lymphatic mapping near a tumour. High levels of uptake of PEGylated-CH1055 dye were observed in brain tumours in mice, suggesting that the dye was detected at a depth of ∼4 mm. The CH1055 dye also allowed targeted molecular imaging of tumours in vivo when conjugated with anti-EGFR Affibody. Moreover, a superior tumour-to-background signal ratio allowed precise image-guided tumour-removal surgery."
764,A three-dimensional engineered tumour for spatial snapshot analysis of cell metabolism and phenotype in hypoxic gradients,2015-11-23,"The profound metabolic reprogramming that occurs in cancer cells has been investigated primarily in two-dimensional cell cultures, which fail to recapitulate spatial aspects of cell-to-cell interactions as well as tissue gradients present in three-dimensional tumours. Here, we describe an engineered model to assemble three-dimensional tumours by rolling a scaffold–tumour composite strip. By unrolling the strip, the model can be rapidly disassembled for snapshot analysis, allowing spatial mapping of cell metabolism in concert with cell phenotype. We also show that the establishment of oxygen gradients within samples that are shaped by oxygen-dependent signalling pathways, as well as the consequential variations in cell growth, response to hypoxic gradients extending from normoxia to severe hypoxia, and therapy responsiveness, are consistent with those of tumours in vivo. Moreover, by using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we mapped cellular metabolism and identified spatially defined metabolic signatures of cancer cells to reveal both known and novel metabolic responses to hypoxia."
765,Thermodynamics of the hybrid interaction of hydrogen with palladium nanoparticles,2015-11-16,"Palladium–hydrogen is a prototypical metal–hydrogen system. It is therefore not at all surprising that a lot of attention has been devoted to the absorption and desorption of hydrogen in nanosized palladium particles. Several seminal articles on the interaction of H with Pd nanocubes and nanoparticles have recently been published. Although each article provides for the first time detailed data on specific aspects of hydrogen in nanoparticles, they individually do not contain enough information to draw firm conclusions about the involved mechanisms. Here, we show that the large body of data available so far in literature exhibits general patterns that lead to unambiguous conclusions about the processes involved in H absorption and desorption in Pd nanoparticles. On the basis of a remarkably robust scaling law for the hysteresis in absorption–desorption isotherms, we show that hydrogen absorption in palladium nanoparticles is consistent with a coherent interface model and is thus clearly different from bulk Pd behaviour. However, H desorption occurs fully coherently only for small nanoparticles (typically smaller than 50 nm) at temperatures sufficiently close to the critical temperature. For larger particles it is partially incoherent, as in bulk, where dilute α-PdHx and high concentration β-PdHx phases coexist."
766,A magnetic protein biocompass,2015-11-16,"The notion that animals can detect the Earth’s magnetic field was once ridiculed, but is now well established. Yet the biological nature of such magnetosensing phenomenon remains unknown. Here, we report a putative magnetic receptor (Drosophila CG8198, here named MagR) and a multimeric magnetosensing rod-like protein complex, identified by theoretical postulation and genome-wide screening, and validated with cellular, biochemical, structural and biophysical methods. The magnetosensing complex consists of the identified putative magnetoreceptor and known magnetoreception-related photoreceptor cryptochromes (Cry), has the attributes of both Cry- and iron-based systems, and exhibits spontaneous alignment in magnetic fields, including that of the Earth. Such a protein complex may form the basis of magnetoreception in animals, and may lead to applications across multiple fields."
767,Deep blue phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes with very high brightness and efficiency,2015-10-19,"The combination of both very high brightness and deep blue emission from phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PHOLED) is required for both display and lighting applications, yet so far has not been reported. A source of this difficulty is the absence of electron/exciton blocking layers (EBL) that are compatible with the high triplet energy of the deep blue dopant and the high frontier orbital energies of hosts needed to transport charge. Here, we show that N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) Ir(III) complexes can serve as both deep blue emitters and efficient hole-conducting EBLs. The NHC EBLs enable very high brightness (>7,800 cd m−2) operation, while achieving deep blue emission with colour coordinates of [0.16, 0.09], suitable for most demanding display applications. We find that both the facial and the meridional isomers of the dopant have high efficiencies that arise from the unusual properties of the NHC ligand—that is, the complexes possess a strong metal–ligand bond that destabilizes the non-radiative metal-centred ligand-field states. Our results represent an advance in blue-emitting PHOLED architectures and materials combinations that meet the requirements of many critical illumination applications."
768,A high-specific-strength and corrosion-resistant magnesium alloy,2015-10-19,"Ultra-lightweight alloys with high strength, ductility and corrosion resistance are desirable for applications in the automotive, aerospace, defence, biomedical, sporting and electronic goods sectors. Ductility and corrosion resistance are generally inversely correlated with strength, making it difficult to optimize all three simultaneously. Here we design an ultralow density (1.4 g cm−3) Mg–Li-based alloy that is strong, ductile, and more corrosion resistant than Mg-based alloys reported so far. The alloy is Li-rich and a solute nanostructure within a body-centred cubic matrix is achieved by a series of extrusion, heat-treatment and rolling processes. Corrosion resistance from the environment is believed to occur by a uniform lithium carbonate film in which surface coverage is much greater than in traditional hexagonal close-packed Mg-based alloys, explaining the superior corrosion resistance of the alloy."
769,Design principles for maximizing photovoltage in metal-oxide-protected water-splitting photoanodes,2015-10-19,"Metal oxide protection layers for photoanodes may enable the development of large-scale solar fuel and solar chemical synthesis, but the poor photovoltages often reported so far will severely limit their performance. Here we report a novel observation of photovoltage loss associated with a charge extraction barrier imposed by the protection layer, and, by eliminating it, achieve photovoltages as high as 630 mV, the maximum reported so far for water-splitting silicon photoanodes. The loss mechanism is systematically probed in metal–insulator–semiconductor Schottky junction cells compared to buried junction p+n cells, revealing the need to maintain a characteristic hole density at the semiconductor/insulator interface. A leaky-capacitor model related to the dielectric properties of the protective oxide explains this loss, achieving excellent agreement with the data. From these findings, we formulate design principles for simultaneous optimization of built-in field, interface quality, and hole extraction to maximize the photovoltage of oxide-protected water-splitting anodes."
770,Fast diffusion of water nanodroplets on graphene,2015-10-19,"Diffusion across surfaces generally involves motion on a vibrating but otherwise stationary substrate. Here, using molecular dynamics, we show that a layered material such as graphene opens up a new mechanism for surface diffusion whereby adsorbates are carried by propagating ripples in a motion similar to surfing. For water nanodroplets, we demonstrate that the mechanism leads to exceedingly fast diffusion that is 2–3 orders of magnitude faster than the self-diffusion of water molecules in liquid water. We also reveal the underlying principles that regulate this new mechanism for diffusion and show how it also applies to adsorbates other than water, thus opening up the prospect of achieving fast and controllable motion of adsorbates across material surfaces more generally."
771,Cell-mediated fibre recruitment drives extracellular matrix mechanosensing in engineered fibrillar microenvironments,2015-10-12,"To investigate how cells sense stiffness in settings structurally similar to native extracellular matrices, we designed a synthetic fibrous material with tunable mechanics and user-defined architecture. In contrast to flat hydrogel surfaces, these fibrous materials recapitulated cell–matrix interactions observed with collagen matrices including stellate cell morphologies, cell-mediated realignment of fibres, and bulk contraction of the material. Increasing the stiffness of flat hydrogel surfaces induced mesenchymal stem cell spreading and proliferation; however, increasing fibre stiffness instead suppressed spreading and proliferation for certain network architectures. Lower fibre stiffness permitted active cellular forces to recruit nearby fibres, dynamically increasing ligand density at the cell surface and promoting the formation of focal adhesions and related signalling. These studies demonstrate a departure from the well-described relationship between material stiffness and spreading established with hydrogel surfaces, and introduce fibre recruitment as a previously undescribed mechanism by which cells probe and respond to mechanics in fibrillar matrices."
772,Enhanced energy transport in genetically engineered excitonic networks,2015-10-12,"One of the challenges for achieving efficient exciton transport in solar energy conversion systems is precise structural control of the light-harvesting building blocks. Here, we create a tunable material consisting of a connected chromophore network on an ordered biological virus template. Using genetic engineering, we establish a link between the inter-chromophoric distances and emerging transport properties. The combination of spectroscopy measurements and dynamic modelling enables us to elucidate quantum coherent and classical incoherent energy transport at room temperature. Through genetic modifications, we obtain a significant enhancement of exciton diffusion length of about 68% in an intermediate quantum-classical regime."
773,Nanosecond homogeneous nucleation and crystal growth in shock-compressed SiO,2015-10-12,"Understanding the kinetics of shock-compressed SiO2 is of great importance for mitigating optical damage for high-intensity lasers and for understanding meteoroid impacts. Experimental work has placed some thermodynamic bounds on the formation of high-pressure phases of this material, but the formation kinetics and underlying microscopic mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. Here, by employing multiscale molecular dynamics studies of shock-compressed fused silica and quartz, we find that silica transforms into a poor glass former that subsequently exhibits ultrafast crystallization within a few nanoseconds. We also find that, as a result of the formation of such an intermediate disordered phase, the transition between silica polymorphs obeys a homogeneous reconstructive nucleation and grain growth model. Moreover, we construct a quantitative model of nucleation and grain growth, and compare its predictions with stishovite grain sizes observed in laser-induced damage and meteoroid impact events."
774,The negative piezoelectric effect of the ferroelectric polymer poly(vinylidene fluoride),2015-10-05,"Piezoelectricity describes interconversion between electrical charge and mechanical strain. As expected for lattice ions displaced in an electric field, the proportionality constant is positive for all piezoelectric materials. The exceptions are poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers with trifluoroethylene (P(VDF-TrFE)), which exhibit a negative longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient. Reported explanations exclusively consider contraction with applied electric field of either the crystalline or the amorphous part of these semi-crystalline polymers. To distinguish between these conflicting interpretations, we have performed in situ dynamic X-ray diffraction measurements on P(VDF-TrFE) capacitors. We find that the piezoelectric effect is dominated by the change in lattice constant but, surprisingly, it cannot be accounted for by the polarization-biased electrostrictive contribution of the crystalline part alone. Our quantitative analysis shows that an additional contribution is operative, which we argue is due to an electromechanical coupling between the intermixed crystalline lamellae and amorphous regions. Our findings tie the counterintuitive negative piezoelectric response of PVDF and its copolymers to the dynamics of their composite microstructure."
775,Three-dimensional macroporous nanoelectronic networks as minimally invasive brain probes,2015-10-05,"Direct electrical recording and stimulation of neural activity using micro-fabricated silicon and metal micro-wire probes have contributed extensively to basic neuroscience and therapeutic applications; however, the dimensional and mechanical mismatch of these probes with the brain tissue limits their stability in chronic implants and decreases the neuron–device contact. Here, we demonstrate the realization of a three-dimensional macroporous nanoelectronic brain probe that combines ultra-flexibility and subcellular feature sizes to overcome these limitations. Built-in strains controlling the local geometry of the macroporous devices are designed to optimize the neuron/probe interface and to promote integration with the brain tissue while introducing minimal mechanical perturbation. The ultra-flexible probes were implanted frozen into rodent brains and used to record multiplexed local field potentials and single-unit action potentials from the somatosensory cortex. Significantly, histology analysis revealed filling-in of neural tissue through the macroporous network and attractive neuron–probe interactions, consistent with long-term biocompatibility of the device."
776,Convergence of multi-valley bands as the electronic origin of high thermoelectric performance in CoSb,2015-10-05,"Filled skutterudites RxCo4Sb12 are excellent n-type thermoelectric materials owing to their high electronic mobility and high effective mass, combined with low thermal conductivity associated with the addition of filler atoms into the void site. The favourable electronic band structure in n-type CoSb3 is typically attributed to threefold degeneracy at the conduction band minimum accompanied by linear band behaviour at higher carrier concentrations, which is thought to be related to the increase in effective mass as the doping level increases. Using combined experimental and computational studies, we show instead that a secondary conduction band with 12 conducting carrier pockets (which converges with the primary band at high temperatures) is responsible for the extraordinary thermoelectric performance of n-type CoSb3 skutterudites. A theoretical explanation is also provided as to why the linear (or Kane-type) band feature is not beneficial for thermoelectrics."
777,Understanding and predicting the orientation of heteroleptic phosphors in organic light-emitting materials,2015-10-05,"Controlling the alignment of the emitting molecules used as dopants in organic light-emitting diodes is an effective strategy to improve the outcoupling efficiency of these devices. To explore the mechanism behind the orientation of dopants in films of organic host materials, we synthesized a coumarin-based ligand that was cyclometalated onto an iridium core to form three phosphorescent heteroleptic molecules, (bppo)2Ir(acac), (bppo)2Ir(ppy) and (ppy)2Ir(bppo) (bppo represents benzopyranopyridinone, ppy represents 2-phenylpyridinate, and acac represents acetylacetonate). Each emitter was doped into a 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1′-biphenyl host layer, and the resultant orientation of their transition dipole moment vectors was measured by angle-dependent p-polarized photoluminescent emission spectroscopy. In solid films, (bppo)2Ir(acac) is found to have a largely horizontal transition dipole vector orientation relative to the substrate, whereas (ppy)2Ir(bppo) and (bppo)2Ir(ppy) are isotropic. We propose that the inherent asymmetry at the surface of the growing film promotes dopant alignment in these otherwise amorphous films. Modelling the net orientation of the transition dipole moments of these materials yields general design rules for further improving horizontal orientation."
778,Plasmons in graphene moiré superlattices,2015-09-28,"Moiré patterns are periodic superlattice structures that appear when two crystals with a minor lattice mismatch are superimposed. A prominent recent example is that of monolayer graphene placed on a crystal of hexagonal boron nitride. As a result of the moiré pattern superlattice created by this stacking, the electronic band structure of graphene is radically altered, acquiring satellite sub-Dirac cones at the superlattice zone boundaries. To probe the dynamical response of the moiré graphene, we use infrared (IR) nano-imaging to explore propagation of surface plasmons, collective oscillations of electrons coupled to IR light. We show that interband transitions associated with the superlattice mini-bands in concert with free electrons in the Dirac bands produce two additive contributions to composite IR plasmons in graphene moiré superstructures. This novel form of collective modes is likely to be generic to other forms of moiré-forming superlattices, including van der Waals heterostructures."
779,Reversible dilatancy in entangled single-wire materials,2015-09-28,"Designing structures that dilate rapidly in both tension and compression would benefit devices such as smart filters, actuators or fasteners. This property however requires an unusual Poisson ratio, or Poisson function at finite strains, which has to vary with applied strain and exceed the familiar bounds: less than 0 in tension and above 1/2 in compression. Here, by combining mechanical tests and discrete element simulations, we show that a simple three-dimensional architected material, made of a self-entangled single long coiled wire, behaves in between discrete and continuum media, with a large and reversible dilatancy in both tension and compression. This unusual behaviour arises from an interplay between the elongation of the coiled wire and rearrangements due to steric effects, which, unlike in traditional discrete media, are hysteretically reversible when the architecture is made of an elastic fibre."
780,Nanoscale transport of charge-transfer states in organic donor–acceptor blends,2015-09-28,"Charge-transfer (CT) states, bound combinations of an electron and a hole on separate molecules, play a crucial role in organic optoelectronic devices. We report direct nanoscale imaging of the transport of long-lived CT states in molecular organic donor–acceptor blends, which demonstrates that the bound electron–hole pairs that form the CT states move geminately over distances of 5–10 nm, driven by energetic disorder and diffusion to lower energy sites. Magnetic field dependence reveals a fluctuating exchange splitting, indicative of a variation in electron–hole spacing during diffusion. The results suggest that the electron–hole pair of the CT state undergoes a stretching transport mechanism analogous to an ‘inchworm’ motion, in contrast to conventional transport of Frenkel excitons. Given the short exciton lifetimes characteristic of bulk heterojunction organic solar cells, this work confirms the potential importance of CT state transport, suggesting that CT states are likely to diffuse farther than Frenkel excitons in many donor–acceptor blends."
781,A sunblock based on bioadhesive nanoparticles,2015-09-28,"The majority of commercial sunblock preparations use organic or inorganic ultraviolet (UV) filters. Despite protecting against cutaneous phototoxicity, direct cellular exposure to UV filters has raised a variety of health concerns. Here, we show that the encapsulation of padimate O (PO)—a model UV filter—in bioadhesive nanoparticles (BNPs) prevents epidermal cellular exposure to UV filters while enhancing UV protection. BNPs are readily suspended in water, facilitate adherence to the stratum corneum without subsequent intra-epidermal or follicular penetration, and their interaction with skin is water resistant yet the particles can be removed via active towel drying. Although the sunblock based on BNPs contained less than 5 wt% of the UV-filter concentration found in commercial standards, the anti-UV effect was comparable when tested in two murine models. Moreover, the BNP-based sunblock significantly reduced double-stranded DNA breaks when compared with a commercial sunscreen formulation."
782,Topological defects in liquid crystals as templates for molecular self-assembly,2015-09-21,"Topological defects in liquid crystals (LCs) have been widely used to organize colloidal dispersions and template polymerization, leading to a range of assemblies, elastomers and gels. However, little is understood about molecular-level assembly processes within defects. Here, we report that nanoscopic environments defined by LC topological defects can selectively trigger processes of molecular self-assembly. By using fluorescence microscopy, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and super-resolution optical microscopy, we observed signatures of molecular self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules in topological defects, including cooperativity, reversibility and controlled growth. We also show that nanoscopic o-rings synthesized from Saturn-ring disclinations and other molecular assemblies templated by defects can be preserved by using photocrosslinkable amphiphiles. Our results reveal that, in analogy to other classes of macromolecular templates such as polymer–surfactant complexes, topological defects in LCs are a versatile class of three-dimensional, dynamic and reconfigurable templates that can direct processes of molecular self-assembly."
783,Magnetically assisted slip casting of bioinspired heterogeneous composites,2015-09-21,"Natural composites are often heterogeneous to fulfil functional demands. Manufacturing analogous materials remains difficult, however, owing to the lack of adequate and easily accessible processing tools. Here, we report an additive manufacturing platform able to fabricate complex-shaped parts exhibiting bioinspired heterogeneous microstructures with locally tunable texture, composition and properties, as well as unprecedentedly high volume fractions of inorganic phase (up to 100%). The technology combines an aqueous-based slip-casting process with magnetically directed particle assembly to create programmed microstructural designs using anisotropic stiff platelets in a ceramic, metal or polymer functional matrix. Using quantitative tools to control the casting kinetics and the temporal pattern of the applied magnetic fields, we demonstrate that this approach is robust and can be exploited to design and fabricate heterogeneous composites with thus far inaccessible microstructures. Proof-of-concept examples include bulk composites with periodic patterns of microreinforcement orientation, and tooth-like bilayer parts with intricate shapes exhibiting site-specific composition and texture."
784,Sequence heuristics to encode phase behaviour in intrinsically disordered protein polymers,2015-09-21,"Proteins and synthetic polymers that undergo aqueous phase transitions mediate self-assembly in nature and in man-made material systems. Yet little is known about how the phase behaviour of a protein is encoded in its amino acid sequence. Here, by synthesizing intrinsically disordered, repeat proteins to test motifs that we hypothesized would encode phase behaviour, we show that the proteins can be designed to exhibit tunable lower or upper critical solution temperature (LCST and UCST, respectively) transitions in physiological solutions. We also show that mutation of key residues at the repeat level abolishes phase behaviour or encodes an orthogonal transition. Furthermore, we provide heuristics to identify, at the proteome level, proteins that might exhibit phase behaviour and to design novel protein polymers consisting of biologically active peptide repeats that exhibit LCST or UCST transitions. These findings set the foundation for the prediction and encoding of phase behaviour at the sequence level."
785,An electrodeposited inhomogeneous metal–insulator–semiconductor junction for efficient photoelectrochemical water oxidation,2015-09-14,"The photoelectrochemical splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen requires a semiconductor to absorb light and generate electron–hole pairs, and a catalyst to enhance the kinetics of electron transfer between the semiconductor and solution. A crucial question is how this catalyst affects the band bending in the semiconductor, and, therefore, the photovoltage of the cell. We introduce a simple and inexpensive electrodeposition method to produce an efficient n-Si/SiOx/Co/CoOOH photoanode for the photoelectrochemical oxidation of water to oxygen. The photoanode functions as a solid-state, metal–insulator–semiconductor photovoltaic cell with spatially non-uniform barrier heights in series with a low overpotential water-splitting electrochemical cell. The barrier height is a function of the Co coverage; it increases from 0.74 eV for a thick, continuous film to 0.91 eV for a thin, inhomogeneous film that has not reached coalescence. The larger barrier height leads to a 360 mV photovoltage enhancement relative to a solid-state Schottky barrier."
786,Matrix elasticity of void-forming hydrogels controls transplanted-stem-cell-mediated bone formation,2015-09-14,"The effectiveness of stem cell therapies has been hampered by cell death and limited control over fate. These problems can be partially circumvented by using macroporous biomaterials that improve the survival of transplanted stem cells and provide molecular cues to direct cell phenotype. Stem cell behaviour can also be controlled in vitro by manipulating the elasticity of both porous and non-porous materials, yet translation to therapeutic processes in vivo remains elusive. Here, by developing injectable, void-forming hydrogels that decouple pore formation from elasticity, we show that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) osteogenesis in vitro, and cell deployment in vitro and in vivo, can be controlled by modifying, respectively, the hydrogel’s elastic modulus or its chemistry. When the hydrogels were used to transplant MSCs, the hydrogel’s elasticity regulated bone regeneration, with optimal bone formation at 60 kPa. Our findings show that biophysical cues can be harnessed to direct therapeutic stem cell behaviours in situ."
787,Efficient hydrogen evolution catalysis using ternary pyrite-type cobalt phosphosulphide,2015-09-14,"The scalable and sustainable production of hydrogen fuel through water splitting demands efficient and robust Earth-abundant catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Building on promising metal compounds with high HER catalytic activity, such as pyrite structure cobalt disulphide (CoS2), and substituting non-metal elements to tune the hydrogen adsorption free energy could lead to further improvements in catalytic activity. Here we present a combined theoretical and experimental study to establish ternary pyrite-type cobalt phosphosulphide (CoPS) as a high-performance Earth-abundant catalyst for electrochemical and photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. Nanostructured CoPS electrodes achieved a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mA cm−2 at overpotentials as low as 48 mV, with outstanding long-term operational stability. Integrated photocathodes of CoPS on n+–p–p+ silicon micropyramids achieved photocurrents up to 35 mA cm−2 at 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), onset photovoltages as high as 450 mV versus RHE, and the most efficient solar-driven hydrogen generation from Earth-abundant systems."
788,Conductivity in organic semiconductors hybridized with the vacuum field,2015-09-14,"Much effort over the past decades has been focused on improving carrier mobility in organic thin-film transistors by optimizing the organization of the material or the device architecture. Here we take a different path to solving this problem, by injecting carriers into states that are hybridized to the vacuum electromagnetic field. To test this idea, organic semiconductors were strongly coupled to plasmonic modes to form coherent states that can extend over as many as 105 molecules and should thereby favour conductivity. Experiments show that indeed the current does increase by an order of magnitude at resonance in the coupled state, reflecting mostly a change in field-effect mobility. A theoretical quantum model confirms the delocalization of the wavefunctions of the hybridized states and its effect on the conductivity. Our findings illustrate the potential of engineering the vacuum electromagnetic environment to modify and to improve properties of materials."
789,Hydride formation thermodynamics and hysteresis in individual Pd nanocrystals with different size and shape,2015-09-07,"Physicochemical properties of nanoparticles may depend on their size and shape and are traditionally assessed in ensemble-level experiments, which accordingly may be plagued by averaging effects. These effects can be eliminated in single-nanoparticle experiments. Using plasmonic nanospectroscopy, we present a comprehensive study of hydride formation thermodynamics in individual Pd nanocrystals of different size and shape, and find corresponding enthalpies and entropies to be nearly size- and shape-independent. The hysteresis observed is significantly wider than in bulk, with details depending on the specifics of individual nanoparticles. Generally, the absorption branch of the hysteresis loop is size-dependent in the sub-30 nm regime, whereas desorption is size- and shape-independent. The former is consistent with a coherent phase transition during hydride formation, influenced kinetically by the specifics of nucleation, whereas the latter implies that hydride decomposition either occurs incoherently or via different kinetic pathways."
790,Néel-type skyrmion lattice with confined orientation in the polar magnetic semiconductor GaV,2015-09-07,"Following the early prediction of the skyrmion lattice (SkL)—a periodic array of spin vortices—it has been observed recently in various magnetic crystals mostly with chiral structure. Although non-chiral but polar crystals with Cnv symmetry were identified as ideal SkL hosts in pioneering theoretical studies, this archetype of SkL has remained experimentally unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of a SkL in the polar magnetic semiconductor GaV4S8 with rhombohedral (C3v) symmetry and easy axis anisotropy. The SkL exists over an unusually broad temperature range compared with other bulk crystals and the orientation of the vortices is not controlled by the external magnetic field, but instead confined to the magnetic easy axis. Supporting theory attributes these unique features to a new Néel-type of SkL describable as a superposition of spin cycloids in contrast to the Bloch-type SkL in chiral magnets described in terms of spin helices."
791,Microtubules self-repair in response to mechanical stress,2015-09-07,"Microtubules—which define the shape of axons, cilia and flagella, and provide tracks for intracellular transport—can be highly bent by intracellular forces, and microtubule structure and stiffness are thought to be affected by physical constraints. Yet how microtubules tolerate the vast forces exerted on them remains unknown. Here, by using a microfluidic device, we show that microtubule stiffness decreases incrementally with each cycle of bending and release. Similar to other cases of material fatigue, the concentration of mechanical stresses on pre-existing defects in the microtubule lattice is responsible for the generation of more extensive damage, which further decreases microtubule stiffness. Strikingly, damaged microtubules were able to incorporate new tubulin dimers into their lattice and recover their initial stiffness. Our findings demonstrate that microtubules are ductile materials with self-healing properties, that their dynamics does not exclusively occur at their ends, and that their lattice plasticity enables the microtubules’ adaptation to mechanical stresses."
792,Ultra-sparse metasurface for high reflection of low-frequency sound based on artificial Mie resonances,2015-08-31,"Acoustic metamaterials offer great flexibility for manipulating sound waves and promise unprecedented functionality, ranging from transformation acoustics, super-resolution imaging to acoustic cloaking. However, the design of acoustic metamaterials with exciting functionality remains challenging with traditional approaches using classic acoustic elements such as Helmholtz resonators and membranes. Here we demonstrate an ultraslow-fluid-like particle with intense artificial Mie resonances for low-frequency airborne sound. Eigenstate analysis and effective parameter retrieval show two individual negative bands in the single-size unit cell, one of which exhibits a negative bulk modulus supported by the monopolar Mie resonance, whereas the other exhibits a negative mass density induced by the dipolar Mie resonance. The unique single-negative nature is used to develop an ultra-sparse subwavelength metasurface with high reflectance for low-frequency sound. We demonstrate a 0.15λ-thick, 15%-filling ratio metasurface with an insertion loss over 93.4%. The designed Mie resonators provide diverse routes to construct novel acoustic devices with versatile applications."
793,Direct mapping of Li-enabled octahedral tilt ordering and associated strain in nanostructured perovskites,2015-08-31,"Self-assembled nanostructures with periodic phase separation hold great promise for creating two- and three-dimensional superlattices with extraordinary physical properties. Understanding the mechanism(s) driving the formation of such superlattices demands an understanding of their underlying atomic structure. However, the nanoscale structural fluctuations intrinsic to these superlattices pose a new challenge for structure determination methods. Here we develop an optimized atomic-level imaging condition to measure TiO6 octahedral tilt angles, unit-cell-by-unit-cell, in perovskite-based Li0.5−3xNd0.5+xTiO3, and thereby determine the mathematical formula governing this nanoscale superstructure. We obtain a direct real-space correlation of the octahedral tilt modulation with the superstructure geometry and lattice-parameter variations. This reveals a composition-dependent, self-ordered octahedral superlattice. Amazingly, we observe a reversible annihilation/reconstruction of the octahedral superlattice correlated with the delithiation/lithiation process in this promising Li-ion conductor. This approach to quantify local octahedral tilt and correlate it with strain can be applied to characterize complex octahedral behaviours in other advanced oxide systems."
794,Differential basal-to-apical accessibility of lamin A/C epitopes in the nuclear lamina regulated by changes in cytoskeletal tension,2015-08-24,"Nuclear lamins play central roles at the intersection between cytoplasmic signalling and nuclear events. Here, we show that at least two N- and C-terminal lamin epitopes are not accessible at the basal side of the nuclear envelope under environmental conditions known to upregulate cell contractility. The conformational epitope on the Ig-domain of A-type lamins is more buried in the basal than apical nuclear envelope of human mesenchymal stem cells undergoing osteogenesis (but not adipogenesis), and in fibroblasts adhering to rigid (but not soft) polyacrylamide hydrogels. This structural polarization of the lamina is promoted by compressive forces, emerges during cell spreading, and requires lamin A/C multimerization, intact nucleoskeleton–cytoskeleton linkages (LINC), and apical-actin stress-fibre assembly. Notably, the identified Ig-epitope overlaps with emerin, DNA and histone binding sites, and comprises various laminopathy mutation sites. Our findings should help decipher how the physical properties of cellular microenvironments regulate nuclear events."
795,Flexible high power-per-weight perovskite solar cells with chromium oxide–metal contacts for improved stability in air,2015-08-24,"Photovoltaic technology requires light-absorbing materials that are highly efficient, lightweight, low cost and stable during operation. Organolead halide perovskites constitute a highly promising class of materials, but suffer limited stability under ambient conditions without heavy and costly encapsulation. Here, we report ultrathin (3 μm), highly flexible perovskite solar cells with stabilized 12% efficiency and a power-per-weight as high as 23 W g−1. To facilitate air-stable operation, we introduce a chromium oxide–chromium interlayer that effectively protects the metal top contacts from reactions with the perovskite. The use of a transparent polymer electrode treated with dimethylsulphoxide as the bottom layer allows the deposition—from solution at low temperature—of pinhole-free perovskite films at high yield on arbitrary substrates, including thin plastic foils. These ultra-lightweight solar cells are successfully used to power aviation models. Potential future applications include unmanned aerial vehicles—from airplanes to quadcopters and weather balloons—for environmental and industrial monitoring, rescue and emergency response, and tactical security applications."
796,Large-area high-quality 2D ultrathin Mo,2015-08-17,"Transition metal carbides (TMCs) are a large family of materials with many intriguing properties and applications, and high-quality 2D TMCs are essential for investigating new physics and properties in the 2D limit. However, the 2D TMCs obtained so far are chemically functionalized, defective nanosheets having maximum lateral dimensions of ∼10 μm. Here we report the fabrication of large-area high-quality 2D ultrathin α-Mo2C crystals by chemical vapour deposition (CVD). The crystals are a few nanometres thick, over 100 μm in size, and very stable under ambient conditions. They show 2D characteristics of superconducting transitions that are consistent with Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless behaviour and show strong anisotropy with magnetic field orientation; moreover, the superconductivity is also strongly dependent on the crystal thickness. Our versatile CVD process allows the fabrication of other high-quality 2D TMC crystals, such as ultrathin WC and TaC crystals, which further expand the large family of 2D materials."
797,Design principles for solid-state lithium superionic conductors,2015-08-17,"Lithium solid electrolytes can potentially address two key limitations of the organic electrolytes used in today’s lithium-ion batteries, namely, their flammability and limited electrochemical stability. However, achieving a Li+ conductivity in the solid state comparable to existing liquid electrolytes (>1 mS cm−1) is particularly challenging. In this work, we reveal a fundamental relationship between anion packing and ionic transport in fast Li-conducting materials and expose the desirable structural attributes of good Li-ion conductors. We find that an underlying body-centred cubic-like anion framework, which allows direct Li hops between adjacent tetrahedral sites, is most desirable for achieving high ionic conductivity, and that indeed this anion arrangement is present in several known fast Li-conducting materials and other fast ion conductors. These findings provide important insight towards the understanding of ionic transport in Li-ion conductors and serve as design principles for future discovery and design of improved electrolytes for Li-ion batteries."
798,Phage-mediated counting by the naked eye of miRNA molecules at attomolar concentrations in a Petri dish,2015-08-17,"The ability to count biomolecules such as cancer-biomarker miRNAs with the naked eye is seemingly impossible in molecular diagnostics. Here, we show an ultrasensitive naked-eye-counting strategy for quantifying miRNAs by employing T7 phage—a bacteria-specific virus nanoparticle—as a surrogate. The phage is genetically engineered to become fluorescent and capable of binding a miRNA-capturing gold nanoparticle (GNP) in a one-to-one manner. Target miRNAs crosslink the resultant phage–GNP couple and miRNA-capturing magnetic microparticles, forming a sandwich complex containing equimolar phage and miRNA. The phage is then released from the complex and developed into one macroscopic fluorescent plaque in a Petri dish by plating it in a host bacterial medium. Counting the plaques by the naked eye enables the quantification of miRNAs with detection limits of ∼3 and ∼5 aM for single-target and two-target miRNAs, respectively. This approach offers ultrasensitive and convenient quantification of disease biomarkers by the naked eye."
799,Identification of catalytic sites for oxygen reduction in iron- and nitrogen-doped graphene materials,2015-08-10,"While platinum has hitherto been the element of choice for catalysing oxygen electroreduction in acidic polymer fuel cells, tremendous progress has been reported for pyrolysed Fe–N–C materials. However, the structure of their active sites has remained elusive, delaying further advance. Here, we synthesized Fe–N–C materials quasi-free of crystallographic iron structures after argon or ammonia pyrolysis. These materials exhibit nearly identical Mössbauer spectra and identical X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) spectra, revealing the same Fe-centred moieties. However, the much higher activity and basicity of NH3-pyrolysed Fe–N–C materials demonstrates that the turnover frequency of Fe-centred moieties depends on the physico-chemical properties of the support. Following a thorough XANES analysis, the detailed structures of two FeN4 porphyrinic architectures with different O2 adsorption modes were then identified. These porphyrinic moieties are not easily integrated in graphene sheets, in contrast with Fe-centred moieties assumed hitherto for pyrolysed Fe–N–C materials. These new insights open the path to bottom-up synthesis approaches and studies on site–support interactions."
800,Epitaxial growth of two-dimensional stanene,2015-08-03,"Following the first experimental realization of graphene, other ultrathin materials with unprecedented electronic properties have been explored, with particular attention given to the heavy group-IV elements Si, Ge and Sn. Two-dimensional buckled Si-based silicene has been recently realized by molecular beam epitaxy growth, whereas Ge-based germanene was obtained by molecular beam epitaxy and mechanical exfoliation. However, the synthesis of Sn-based stanene has proved challenging so far. Here, we report the successful fabrication of 2D stanene by molecular beam epitaxy, confirmed by atomic and electronic characterization using scanning tunnelling microscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, in combination with first-principles calculations. The synthesis of stanene and its derivatives will stimulate further experimental investigation of their theoretically predicted properties, such as a 2D topological insulating behaviour with a very large bandgap, and the capability to support enhanced thermoelectric performance, topological superconductivity and the near-room-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect."
801,Fast and long-range triplet exciton diffusion in metal–organic frameworks for photon upconversion at ultralow excitation power,2015-08-03,"The conversion of low-energy light into photons of higher energy based on sensitized triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) has emerged as a promising wavelength-shifting methodology because it permits UC at excitation powers as low as the solar irradiance. However, its application has been significantly hampered by the slow diffusion of excited molecules in solid matrices. Here, we introduce metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) that promote TTA-UC by taking advantage of triplet exciton migration among fluorophores that are regularly aligned with spatially controlled chromophore orientations. We synthesized anthracene-containing MOFs with different molecular orientations, and the analysis of TTA-UC emission kinetics unveiled a high triplet diffusion rate with a micrometre-scale diffusion length. Surface modification of MOF nanocrystals with donor molecules and their encapsulation in glassy poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) allowed the construction of molecular-diffusion-free solid-state upconverters, which lead to an unprecedented maximization of overall UC quantum yield at excitation powers comparable to or well below the solar irradiance."
802,Unjamming and cell shape in the asthmatic airway epithelium,2015-08-03,"From coffee beans flowing in a chute to cells remodelling in a living tissue, a wide variety of close-packed collective systems—both inert and living—have the potential to jam. The collective can sometimes flow like a fluid or jam and rigidify like a solid. The unjammed-to-jammed transition remains poorly understood, however, and structural properties characterizing these phases remain unknown. Using primary human bronchial epithelial cells, we show that the jamming transition in asthma is linked to cell shape, thus establishing in that system a structural criterion for cell jamming. Surprisingly, the collapse of critical scaling predicts a counter-intuitive relationship between jamming, cell shape and cell–cell adhesive stresses that is borne out by direct experimental observations. Cell shape thus provides a rigorous structural signature for classification and investigation of bronchial epithelial layer jamming in asthma, and potentially in any process in disease or development in which epithelial dynamics play a prominent role."
803,Fluctuation-driven mechanotransduction regulates mitochondrial-network structure and function,2015-07-27,"Cells can be exposed to irregular mechanical fluctuations, such as those arising from changes in blood pressure. Here, we report that ATP production, assessed through changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, is downregulated in vascular smooth muscle cells in culture exposed to monotonous stretch cycles when compared with cells exposed to a variable cyclic stretch that incorporates physiological levels of cycle-by-cycle variability in stretch amplitude. Variable stretch enhances ATP production by increasing the expression of ATP synthase’s catalytic domain, cytochrome c oxidase and its tyrosine phosphorylation, mitofusins and PGC-1α. Such a fluctuation-driven mechanotransduction mechanism is mediated by motor proteins and by the enhancement of microtubule-, actin- and mitochondrial-network complexity. We also show that, in aorta rings isolated from rats, monotonous stretch downregulates—whereas variable stretch maintains—physiological vessel-wall contractility through mitochondrial ATP production. Our results have implications for ATP-dependent and mechanosensitive intracellular processes."
804,A pH-responsive supramolecular polymer gel as an enteric elastomer for use in gastric devices,2015-07-27,"Devices resident in the stomach—used for a variety of clinical applications including nutritional modulation for bariatrics, ingestible electronics for diagnosis and monitoring, and gastric-retentive dosage forms for prolonged drug delivery—typically incorporate elastic polymers to compress the devices during delivery through the oesophagus and other narrow orifices in the digestive system. However, in the event of accidental device fracture or migration, the non-degradable nature of these materials risks intestinal obstruction. Here, we show that an elastic, pH-responsive supramolecular gel remains stable and elastic in the acidic environment of the stomach but can be dissolved in the neutral-pH environment of the small and large intestines. In a large animal model, prototype devices with these materials as the key component demonstrated prolonged gastric retention and safe passage. These enteric elastomers should increase the safety profile for a wide range of gastric-retentive devices."
805,Pressure-induced superconductivity in the iron-based ladder material BaFe,2015-07-20,"All the iron-based superconductors identified so far share a square lattice composed of Fe atoms as a common feature, despite having different crystal structures. In copper-based materials, the superconducting phase emerges not only in square-lattice structures but also in ladder structures. Yet iron-based superconductors without a square-lattice motif have not been found, despite being actively sought out. Here, we report the discovery of pressure-induced superconductivity in the iron-based spin-ladder material BaFe2S3, a Mott insulator with striped-type magnetic ordering below ∼120 K. On the application of pressure this compound exhibits a metal–insulator transition at about 11 GPa, followed by the appearance of superconductivity below Tc = 14 K, right after the onset of the metallic phase. Our findings indicate that iron-based ladder compounds represent promising material platforms, in particular for studying the fundamentals of iron-based superconductivity."
806,Fractal heterogeneity in minimal matrix models of scars modulates stiff-niche stem-cell responses via nuclear exit of a mechanorepressor,2015-07-13,"Scarring is a long-lasting problem in higher animals, and reductionist approaches could aid in developing treatments. Here, we show that copolymerization of collagen I with polyacrylamide produces minimal matrix models of scars (MMMS), in which fractal-fibre bundles segregate heterogeneously to the hydrogel subsurface. Matrix stiffens locally—as in scars—while allowing separate control over adhesive-ligand density. The MMMS elicits scar-like phenotypes from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs): cells spread and polarize quickly, increasing nucleoskeletal lamin-A yet expressing the ‘scar marker’ smooth muscle actin (SMA) more slowly. Surprisingly, expression responses to MMMS exhibit less cell-to-cell noise than homogeneously stiff gels. Such differences from bulk-average responses arise because a strong SMA repressor, NKX2.5, slowly exits the nucleus on rigid matrices. NKX2.5 overexpression overrides rigid phenotypes, inhibiting SMA and cell spreading, whereas cytoplasm-localized NKX2.5 mutants degrade in well-spread cells. MSCs thus form a ‘mechanical memory’ of rigidity by progressively suppressing NKX2.5, thereby elevating SMA in a scar-like state."
807,Synthesis of nanostructures in nanowires using sequential catalyst reactions,2015-07-13,"Nanowire growth by the vapour–liquid–solid (VLS) process enables a high level of control over nanowire composition, diameter, growth direction, branching and kinking, periodic twinning, and crystal structure. The tremendous impact of VLS-grown nanowires is due to this structural versatility, generating applications ranging from solid-state lighting and single-photon sources to thermoelectric devices. Here, we show that the morphology of these nanostructures can be further tailored by using the liquid droplets that catalyse nanowire growth as a ‘mixing bowl’, in which growth materials are sequentially supplied to nucleate new phases. Growing within the liquid, these phases adopt the shape of faceted nanocrystals that are then incorporated into the nanowires by further growth. We demonstrate this concept by epitaxially incorporating metal-silicide nanocrystals into Si nanowires with defect-free interfaces, and discuss how this process can be generalized to create complex nanowire-based heterostructures."
808,Dislocation locking versus easy glide in titanium and zirconium,2015-07-06,"The ease of a metal to deform plastically in selected crystallographic planes depends on the core structure of its dislocations. As the latter is controlled by electronic interactions, metals with the same valence electron configuration usually exhibit a similar plastic behaviour. For this reason, titanium and zirconium, two transition metals of technological importance from the same column of the periodic table, have so far been assumed to deform in a similar fashion. However, we show here, using in situ transmission electron microscopy straining experiments, that plasticity proceeds very differently in these two metals, being intermittent in Ti and continuous in Zr. This observation is rationalized using first-principles calculations, which reveal that, in both metals, dislocations may adopt the same set of different cores that are either glissile or sessile. An inversion of stability of these cores between Zr and Ti is shown to be at the origin of the profoundly different plastic behaviours."
809, NMR and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance techniques reveal the structure of the electrical double layer in supercapacitors,2015-06-22,"Supercapacitors store charge through the electrosorption of ions on microporous electrodes. Despite major efforts to understand this phenomenon, a molecular-level picture of the electrical double layer in working devices is still lacking as few techniques can selectively observe the ionic species at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Here, we use in situ NMR to directly quantify the populations of anionic and cationic species within a working microporous carbon supercapacitor electrode. Our results show that charge storage mechanisms are different for positively and negatively polarized electrodes for the electrolyte tetraethylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate in acetonitrile; for positive polarization charging proceeds by exchange of the cations for anions, whereas for negative polarization, cation adsorption dominates. In situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance measurements support the NMR results and indicate that adsorbed ions are only partially solvated. These results provide new molecular-level insight, with the methodology offering exciting possibilities for the study of pore/ion size, desolvation and other effects on charge storage in supercapacitors."
810,Backward phase-matching for nonlinear optical generation in negative-index materials,2015-06-15,"Metamaterials have enabled the realization of unconventional electromagnetic properties not found in nature, which provokes us to rethink the established rules of optics in both the linear and nonlinear regimes. One of the most intriguing phenomena in nonlinear metamaterials is ‘backward phase-matching’, which describes counter-propagating fundamental and harmonic waves in a negative-index medium. Predicted nearly a decade ago, this process is still awaiting a definitive experimental confirmation at optical frequencies. Here, we report optical measurements showing backward phase-matching by exploiting two distinct modes in a nonlinear plasmonic waveguide, where the real parts of the mode refractive indices are 3.4 and −3.4 for the fundamental and the harmonic waves respectively. The observed peak conversion efficiency at the excitation wavelength of ∼780 nm indicates the fulfilment of the phase-matching condition of k2ω = 2kω and n2ω = −nω, where the coherent harmonic wave emerges along a direction opposite to that of the incoming fundamental light."
811,The effect of mechanical twisting on oxygen ionic transport in solid-state energy conversion membranes,2015-06-15,"Understanding ‘electro–chemo–mechanics’ in oxygen ion conducting membranes represents a foundational step towards new energy devices such as micro fuel cells and oxygen or fuel separation membranes. For ionic transport in macro crystalline electrolytes, doping is conventionally used to affect oxygen ionic association/migration energies. Recently, tuning ionic transport in films through lattice strain conveyed by substrates or heterostructures has generated much interest. However, reliable manipulation of strain states to twist the ionic conduction in real micro energy devices remains intractable. Here, we demonstrate that the oxygen ionic conductivity clearly correlates with the compressive strain energy acting on the near order of the electrolyte lattices by comparing thin-film ceria-based membrane devices against substrate-supported flat structures. It is possible to capitalize on this phenomenon with a smart choice of strain patterns achieved through microelectrode design. We highlight the importance of electro–chemo–mechanics in the electrolyte material for the next generation of solid-state energy conversion microdevices."
812,Elastic coupling between layers in two-dimensional materials,2015-06-15,"Two-dimensional materials, such as graphene and MoS2, are films of a few atomic layers in thickness with strong in-plane bonds and weak interactions between the layers. The in-plane elasticity has been widely studied in bending experiments where a suspended film is deformed substantially; however, little is known about the films’ elastic modulus perpendicular to the planes, as the measurement of the out-of-plane elasticity of supported 2D films requires indentation depths smaller than the films’ interlayer distance. Here, we report on sub-ångström-resolution indentation measurements of the perpendicular-to-the-plane elasticity of 2D materials. Our indentation data, combined with semi-analytical models and density functional theory, are then used to study the perpendicular elasticity of few-layer-thick graphene and graphene oxide films. We find that the perpendicular Young’s modulus of graphene oxide films reaches a maximum when one complete water layer is intercalated between the graphitic planes. This non-destructive methodology can map interlayer coupling and intercalation in 2D films."
813,The role of quasi-plasticity in the extreme contact damage tolerance of the stomatopod dactyl club,2015-06-08,"The structure of the stomatopod dactyl club—an ultrafast, hammer-like device used by the animal to shatter hard seashells—offers inspiration for impact-tolerant ceramics. Here, we present the micromechanical principles and related micromechanisms of deformation that impart the club with high impact tolerance. By using depth-sensing nanoindentation with spherical and sharp contact tips in combination with post-indentation residual stress mapping by Raman microspectroscopy, we show that the impact surface region of the dactyl club exhibits a quasi-plastic contact response associated with the interfacial sliding and rotation of fluorapatite nanorods, endowing the club with localized yielding. We also show that the subsurface layers exhibit strain hardening by microchannel densification, which provides additional dissipation of impact energy. Our findings suggest that the club’s macroscopic size is below the critical size above which Hertzian brittle cracks are nucleated."
814,Extreme mobility enhancement of two-dimensional electron gases at oxide interfaces by charge-transfer-induced modulation doping,2015-06-01,"Two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) formed at the interface of insulating complex oxides promise the development of all-oxide electronic devices. These 2DEGs involve many-body interactions that give rise to a variety of physical phenomena such as superconductivity, magnetism, tunable metal–insulator transitions and phase separation. Increasing the mobility of the 2DEG, however, remains a major challenge. Here, we show that the electron mobility is enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude by inserting a single-unit-cell insulating layer of polar La1−xSrxMnO3 (x = 0, 1/8, and 1/3) at the interface between disordered LaAlO3 and crystalline SrTiO3 produced at room temperature. Resonant X-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy show that the manganite layer undergoes unambiguous electronic reconstruction, leading to modulation doping of such atomically engineered complex oxide heterointerfaces. At low temperatures, the modulation-doped 2DEG exhibits Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations and fingerprints of the quantum Hall effect, demonstrating unprecedented high mobility and low electron density."
815,Accelerated wound healing by injectable microporous gel scaffolds assembled from annealed building blocks,2015-06-01,"Injectable hydrogels can provide a scaffold for in situ tissue regrowth and regeneration, yet gel degradation before tissue reformation limits the gels’ ability to provide physical support. Here, we show that this shortcoming can be circumvented through an injectable, interconnected microporous gel scaffold assembled from annealed microgel building blocks whose chemical and physical properties can be tailored by microfluidic fabrication. In vitro, cells incorporated during scaffold formation proliferated and formed extensive three-dimensional networks within 48 h. In vivo, the scaffolds facilitated cell migration that resulted in rapid cutaneous-tissue regeneration and tissue-structure formation within five days. The combination of microporosity and injectability of these annealed gel scaffolds should enable novel routes to tissue regeneration and formation in vivo."
816,Symmetry of charge order in cuprates,2015-05-25,"Charge-ordered ground states permeate the phenomenology of 3d-based transition metal oxides, and more generally represent a distinctive hallmark of strongly correlated states of matter. The recent discovery of charge order in various cuprate families has fuelled new interest into the role played by this incipient broken symmetry within the complex phase diagram of high-Tc superconductors. Here, we use resonant X-ray scattering to resolve the main characteristics of the charge-modulated state in two cuprate families: Bi2Sr2−xLaxCuO6+δ (Bi2201) and YBa2Cu3O6+y (YBCO). We detect no signatures of spatial modulations along the nodal direction in Bi2201, thus clarifying the inter-unit-cell momentum structure of charge order. We also resolve the intra-unit-cell symmetry of the charge-ordered state, which is revealed to be best represented by a bond order with modulated charges on the O-2p orbitals and a prominent d-wave character. These results provide insights into the origin and microscopic description of charge order in cuprates, and its interplay with superconductivity."
817,Anisotropic nanoparticle complementarity in DNA-mediated co-crystallization,2015-05-25,"Whether two species will co-crystallize depends on the chemical, physical and structural complementarity of the interacting components. Here, by using DNA as a surface ligand, we selectively co-crystallize mixtures of two different anisotropic nanoparticles and systematically investigate the effects of nanoparticle size and shape complementarity on the resultant crystal symmetry, microstrain, and effective ‘DNA bond’ length and strength. We then use these results to understand a more complicated system where both size and shape complementarity change, and where one nanoparticle can participate in multiple types of directional interactions. Our findings offer improved control of non-spherical nanoparticles as building blocks for the assembly of sophisticated macroscopic materials, and provide a framework to understand complementarity and directional interactions in DNA-mediated nanoparticle crystallization."
818,Photooxidation and quantum confinement effects in exfoliated black phosphorus,2015-05-25,"Thin layers of black phosphorus have recently raised interest owing to their two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting properties, such as tunable direct bandgap and high carrier mobilities. This lamellar crystal of phosphorus atoms can be exfoliated down to monolayer 2D-phosphane (also called phosphorene) using procedures similar to those used for graphene. Probing the properties has, however, been challenged by a fast degradation of the thinnest layers on exposure to ambient conditions. Herein, we investigate this chemistry using in situ Raman and transmission electron spectroscopies. The results highlight a thickness-dependent photoassisted oxidation reaction with oxygen dissolved in adsorbed water. The oxidation kinetics is consistent with a phenomenological model involving electron transfer and quantum confinement as key parameters. A procedure carried out in a glove box is used to prepare mono-, bi- and multilayer 2D-phosphane in their pristine states for further studies on the effect of layer thickness on the Raman modes. Controlled experiments in ambient conditions are shown to lower the Ag1/Ag2 intensity ratio for ultrathin layers, a signature of oxidation."
819,Selective transformations between nanoparticle superlattices via the reprogramming of DNA-mediated interactions,2015-05-25,"The rapid development of self-assembly approaches has enabled the creation of materials with desired organization of nanoscale components. However, achieving dynamic control, wherein the system can be transformed on demand into multiple entirely different states, is typically absent in atomic and molecular systems and has remained elusive in designed nanoparticle systems. Here, we demonstrate with in situ small-angle X-ray scattering that, by using DNA strands as inputs, the structure of a three-dimensional lattice of DNA-coated nanoparticles can be switched from an initial ‘mother’ phase into one of multiple ‘daughter’ phases. The introduction of different types of reprogramming DNA strands modifies the DNA shells of the nanoparticles within the superlattice, thereby shifting interparticle interactions to drive the transformation into a particular daughter phase. Moreover, we mapped quantitatively with free-energy calculations the selective reprogramming of interactions onto the observed daughter phases."
820,Conformal piezoelectric systems for clinical and experimental characterization of soft tissue biomechanics,2015-05-18,"Mechanical assessment of soft biological tissues and organs has broad relevance in clinical diagnosis and treatment of disease. Existing characterization methods are invasive, lack microscale spatial resolution, and are tailored only for specific regions of the body under quasi-static conditions. Here, we develop conformal and piezoelectric devices that enable in vivo measurements of soft tissue viscoelasticity in the near-surface regions of the epidermis. These systems achieve conformal contact with the underlying complex topography and texture of the targeted skin, as well as other organ surfaces, under both quasi-static and dynamic conditions. Experimental and theoretical characterization of the responses of piezoelectric actuator–sensor pairs laminated on a variety of soft biological tissues and organ systems in animal models provide information on the operation of the devices. Studies on human subjects establish the clinical significance of these devices for rapid and non-invasive characterization of skin mechanical properties."
821,Size- and shape-dependent foreign body immune response to materials implanted in rodents and non-human primates,2015-05-18,"The efficacy of implanted biomedical devices is often compromised by host recognition and subsequent foreign body responses. Here, we demonstrate the role of the geometry of implanted materials on their biocompatibility in vivo. In rodent and non-human primate animal models, implanted spheres 1.5 mm and above in diameter across a broad spectrum of materials, including hydrogels, ceramics, metals and plastics, significantly abrogated foreign body reactions and fibrosis when compared with smaller spheres. We also show that for encapsulated rat pancreatic islet cells transplanted into streptozotocin-treated diabetic C57BL/6 mice, islets prepared in 1.5-mm alginate capsules were able to restore blood-glucose control for up to 180 days, a period more than five times longer than for transplanted grafts encapsulated within conventionally sized 0.5-mm alginate capsules. Our findings suggest that the in vivo biocompatibility of biomedical devices can be significantly improved simply by tuning their spherical dimensions."
822,Measuring surface dislocation nucleation in defect-scarce nanostructures,2015-05-18,"Linear defects in crystalline materials, known as dislocations, are central to the understanding of plastic deformation and mechanical strength, as well as control of performance in a variety of electronic and photonic materials. Despite nearly a century of research on dislocation structure and interactions, measurements of the energetics and kinetics of dislocation nucleation have not been possible, as synthesizing and testing pristine crystals absent of defects has been prohibitively challenging. Here, we report experiments that directly measure the surface dislocation nucleation strengths in high-quality 〈110〉 Pd nanowhiskers subjected to uniaxial tension. We find that, whereas nucleation strengths are weakly size- and strain-rate-dependent, a strong temperature dependence is uncovered, corroborating predictions that nucleation is assisted by thermal fluctuations. We measure atomic-scale activation volumes, which explain both the ultrahigh athermal strength as well as the temperature-dependent scatter, evident in our experiments and well captured by a thermal activation model."
823,Continuous control of the nonlinearity phase for harmonic generations,2015-04-13,"The capability of locally engineering the nonlinear optical properties of media is crucial in nonlinear optics. Although poling is the most widely employed technique for achieving locally controlled nonlinearity, it leads only to a binary nonlinear state, which is equivalent to a discrete phase change of π in the nonlinear polarizability. Here, inspired by the concept of spin-rotation coupling, we experimentally demonstrate nonlinear metasurfaces with homogeneous linear optical properties but spatially varying effective nonlinear polarizability with continuously controllable phase. The continuous phase control over the local nonlinearity is demonstrated for second and third harmonic generation by using nonlinear metasurfaces consisting of nanoantennas of C3 and C4 rotational symmetries, respectively. The continuous phase engineering of the effective nonlinear polarizability enables complete control over the propagation of harmonic generation signals. Therefore, this method seamlessly combines the generation and manipulation of harmonic waves, paving the way for highly compact nonlinear nanophotonic devices."
824,Lead halide perovskite nanowire lasers with low lasing thresholds and high quality factors,2015-04-13,"The remarkable performance of lead halide perovskites in solar cells can be attributed to the long carrier lifetimes and low non-radiative recombination rates, the same physical properties that are ideal for semiconductor lasers. Here, we show room-temperature and wavelength-tunable lasing from single-crystal lead halide perovskite nanowires with very low lasing thresholds (220 nJ cm−2) and high quality factors (Q ∼ 3,600). The lasing threshold corresponds to a charge carrier density as low as 1.5 × 1016 cm−3. Kinetic analysis based on time-resolved fluorescence reveals little charge carrier trapping in these single-crystal nanowires and gives estimated lasing quantum yields approaching 100%. Such lasing performance, coupled with the facile solution growth of single-crystal nanowires and the broad stoichiometry-dependent tunability of emission colour, makes lead halide perovskites ideal materials for the development of nanophotonics, in parallel with the rapid development in photovoltaics from the same materials."
825,Flexible n-type thermoelectric materials by organic intercalation of layered transition metal dichalcogenide TiS,2015-04-06,"Organic semiconductors are attracting increasing interest as flexible thermoelectric materials owing to material abundance, easy processing and low thermal conductivity. Although progress in p-type polymers and composites has been reported, their n-type counterpart has fallen behind owing to difficulties in n-type doping of organic semiconductors. Here, we present an approach to synthesize n-type flexible thermoelectric materials through a facile electrochemical intercalation method, fabricating a hybrid superlattice of alternating inorganic TiS2 monolayers and organic cations. Electrons were externally injected into the inorganic layers and then stabilized by organic cations, providing n-type carriers for current and energy transport. An electrical conductivity of 790 S cm−1 and a power factor of 0.45 mW m−1 K−2 were obtained for a hybrid superlattice of TiS2/[(hexylammonium)x(H2O)y(DMSO)z], with an in-plane lattice thermal conductivity of 0.12 ± 0.03 W m−1 K−1, which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the thermal conductivities of the single-layer and bulk TiS2. High power factor and low thermal conductivity contributed to a thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT, of 0.28 at 373 K, which might find application in wearable electronics."
826,Single-layer ionic conduction on carboxyl-terminated silane monolayers patterned by constructive lithography,2015-04-06,"Ionic transport plays a central role in key technologies relevant to energy, and information processing and storage, as well as in the implementation of biological functions in living organisms. Here, we introduce a supramolecular strategy based on the non-destructive chemical patterning of a highly ordered self-assembled monolayer that allows the reproducible fabrication of ion-conducting surface patterns (ion-conducting channels) with top –COOH functional groups precisely definable over the full range of length scales from nanometre to centimetre. The transport of a single layer of selected metal ions and the electrochemical processes related to their motion may thus be confined to predefined surface paths. As a generic solid ionic conductor that can accommodate different mobile ions in the absence of any added electrolyte, these ion-conducting channels exhibit bias-induced competitive transport of different ionic species. This approach offers unprecedented opportunities for the realization of designed ion-conducting systems with nanoscale control, beyond the inherent limitations posed by available ionic materials."
827,Biodegradable silicon nanoneedles delivering nucleic acids intracellularly induce localized ,2015-03-30,"The controlled delivery of nucleic acids to selected tissues remains an inefficient process mired by low transfection efficacy, poor scalability because of varying efficiency with cell type and location, and questionable safety as a result of toxicity issues arising from the typical materials and procedures employed. High efficiency and minimal toxicity in vitro has been shown for intracellular delivery of nuclei acids by using nanoneedles, yet extending these characteristics to in vivo delivery has been difficult, as current interfacing strategies rely on complex equipment or active cell internalization through prolonged interfacing. Here, we show that a tunable array of biodegradable nanoneedles fabricated by metal-assisted chemical etching of silicon can access the cytosol to co-deliver DNA and siRNA with an efficiency greater than 90%, and that in vivo the nanoneedles transfect the VEGF-165 gene, inducing sustained neovascularization and a localized sixfold increase in blood perfusion in a target region of the muscle."
828,Phonon-induced diamagnetic force and its effect on the lattice thermal conductivity,2015-03-23,"Phonons are displacements of atoms around their rest positions in a crystalline solid. They carry sound and heat, but are not classically associated with magnetism. Here, we show that phonons are, in fact, sensitive to magnetic fields, even in diamagnetic materials. We do so by demonstrating experimentally that acoustic phonons in a diamagnetic semiconductor (InSb) scatter more strongly from one another when a magnetic field is applied. We attribute this observation to the magnetic-field sensitivity of the anharmonicity of the interatomic bonds that govern the probability of phonon–phonon interactions. The displacements of atoms locally affect the orbital motion of valence band electrons, which, in the presence of an external magnetic field, spatially modulates the orbital diamagnetism around the displaced atoms. The spatial gradient in magnetic moment results in an anharmonic magnetic force exerted on the displaced atom. The process is modelled by ab initio calculations that, without the use of a single adjustable parameter, reproduce the observed 12% decrease in the lattice thermal conductivity under a 7 T magnetic field at a temperature of 5.2 K."
829, atomic-scale observation of twinning-dominated deformation in nanoscale body-centred cubic tungsten,2015-03-09,"Twinning is a fundamental deformation mode that competes against dislocation slip in crystalline solids. In metallic nanostructures, plastic deformation requires higher stresses than those needed in their bulk counterparts, resulting in the ‘smaller is stronger’ phenomenon. Such high stresses are thought to favour twinning over dislocation slip. Deformation twinning has been well documented in face-centred cubic (FCC) nanoscale crystals. However, it remains unexplored in body-centred cubic (BCC) nanoscale crystals. Here, by using in situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and atomistic simulations, we show that twinning is the dominant deformation mechanism in nanoscale crystals of BCC tungsten. Such deformation twinning is pseudoelastic, manifested through reversible detwinning during unloading. We find that the competition between twinning and dislocation slip can be mediated by loading orientation, which is attributed to the competing nucleation mechanism of defects in nanoscale BCC crystals. Our work provides direct observations of deformation twinning as well as new insights into the deformation mechanism in BCC nanostructures."
830,Synthesis of ultrathin polymer insulating layers by initiated chemical vapour deposition for low-power soft electronics,2015-03-09,"Insulating layers based on oxides and nitrides provide high capacitance, low leakage, high breakdown field and resistance to electrical stresses when used in electronic devices based on rigid substrates. However, their typically high process temperatures and brittleness make it difficult to achieve similar performance in flexible or organic electronics. Here, we show that poly(1,3,5-trimethyl-1,3,5-trivinyl cyclotrisiloxane) (pV3D3) prepared via a one-step, solvent-free technique called initiated chemical vapour deposition (iCVD) is a versatile polymeric insulating layer that meets a wide range of requirements for next-generation electronic devices. Highly uniform and pure ultrathin films of pV3D3 with excellent insulating properties, a large energy gap (>8 eV), tunnelling-limited leakage characteristics and resistance to a tensile strain of up to 4% are demonstrated. The low process temperature, surface-growth character, and solvent-free nature of the iCVD process enable pV3D3 to be grown conformally on plastic substrates to yield flexible field-effect transistors as well as on a variety of channel layers, including organics, oxides, and graphene."
831,Atomic origin of ultrafast resistance switching in nanoscale electrometallization cells,2015-03-02,"Nanoscale resistance-switching cells that operate via the electrochemical formation and disruption of metallic filaments that bridge two electrodes are among the most promising devices for post-CMOS electronics. Despite their importance, the mechanisms that govern their remarkable properties are not fully understood, especially for nanoscale devices operating at ultrafast rates, limiting our ability to assess the ultimate performance and scalability of this technology. We present the first atomistic simulations of the operation of conductive bridging cells using reactive molecular dynamics with a charge equilibration method extended to describe electrochemical reactions. The simulations predict the ultrafast switching observed in these devices, with timescales ranging from hundreds of picoseconds to a few nanoseconds for devices consisting of Cu active electrodes and amorphous silica dielectrics and with dimensions corresponding to their scaling limit (cross-sections below 10 nm). We find that single-atom-chain bridges often form during device operation but that they are metastable, with lifetimes below a nanosecond. The formation of stable filaments involves the aggregation of ions into small metallic clusters, followed by a progressive chemical reduction as they become connected to the cathode. Contrary to observations in larger cells, the nanoscale conductive bridges often lack crystalline order. An atomic-level mechanistic understanding of the switching process provides guidelines for materials optimization for such applications and the quantitative predictions over an ensemble of devices provide insight into their ultimate scaling and performance."
832,A photoreversible protein-patterning approach for guiding stem cell fate in three-dimensional gels,2015-02-23,"Although biochemically patterned hydrogels are capable of recapitulating many critical aspects of the heterogeneous cellular niche, exercising spatial and temporal control of the presentation and removal of biomolecular signalling cues in such systems has proved difficult. Here, we demonstrate a synthetic strategy that exploits two bioorthogonal photochemistries to achieve reversible immobilization of bioactive full-length proteins with good spatial and temporal control within synthetic, cell-laden biomimetic scaffolds. A photodeprotection–oxime-ligation sequence permits user-defined quantities of proteins to be anchored within distinct subvolumes of a three-dimensional matrix, and an ortho-nitrobenzyl ester photoscission reaction facilitates subsequent protein removal. By using this approach to pattern the presentation of the extracellular matrix protein vitronectin, we accomplished reversible differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts in a spatially defined manner. Our protein-patterning approach should provide further avenues to probe and direct changes in cell physiology in response to dynamic biochemical signalling."
833,Dirac mass generation from crystal symmetry breaking on the surfaces of topological crystalline insulators,2015-02-16,"The tunability of topological surface states and controllable opening of the Dirac gap are of fundamental and practical interest in the field of topological materials. In the newly discovered topological crystalline insulators (TCIs), theory predicts that the Dirac node is protected by a crystalline symmetry and that the surface state electrons can acquire a mass if this symmetry is broken. Recent studies have detected signatures of a spontaneously generated Dirac gap in TCIs; however, the mechanism of mass formation remains elusive. In this work, we present scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) measurements of the TCI Pb1−xSnxSe for a wide range of alloy compositions spanning the topological and non-topological regimes. The STM topographies reveal a symmetry-breaking distortion on the surface, which imparts mass to the otherwise massless Dirac electrons—a mechanism analogous to the long sought-after Higgs mechanism in particle physics. Interestingly, the measured Dirac gap decreases on approaching the trivial phase, whereas the magnitude of the distortion remains nearly constant. Our data and calculations reveal that the penetration depth of Dirac surface states controls the magnitude of the Dirac mass. At the limit of the critical composition, the penetration depth is predicted to go to infinity, resulting in zero mass, consistent with our measurements. Finally, we discover the existence of surface states in the non-topological regime, which have the characteristics of gapped, double-branched Dirac fermions and could be exploited in realizing superconductivity in these materials."
834,Binding configurations and intramolecular strain in single-molecule devices,2015-02-16,"The development of molecular-scale electronic devices has made considerable progress over the past decade, and single-molecule transistors, diodes and wires have all been demonstrated. Despite this remarkable progress, the agreement between theoretically predicted conductance values and those measured experimentally remains limited. One of the primary reasons for these discrepancies lies in the difficulty to experimentally determine the contact geometry and binding configuration of a single-molecule junction. In this Article, we apply a small-amplitude, high-frequency, sinusoidal mechanical signal to a series of single-molecule devices during junction formation and breakdown. By measuring the current response at this frequency, it is possible to determine the most probable binding and contact configurations for the molecular junction at room temperature in solution, and to obtain information about how an applied strain is distributed within the molecular junction. These results provide insight into the complex configuration of single-molecule devices, and are in excellent agreement with previous predictions from theoretical models."
835,Dysprosium-doped cadmium oxide as a gateway material for mid-infrared plasmonics,2015-02-16,"The interest in plasmonic technologies surrounds many emergent optoelectronic applications, such as plasmon lasers, transistors, sensors and information storage. Although plasmonic materials for ultraviolet–visible and near-infrared wavelengths have been found, the mid-infrared range remains a challenge to address: few known systems can achieve subwavelength optical confinement with low loss in this range. With a combination of experiments and ab initio modelling, here we demonstrate an extreme peak of electron mobility in Dy-doped CdO that is achieved through accurate ‘defect equilibrium engineering’. In so doing, we create a tunable plasmon host that satisfies the criteria for mid-infrared spectrum plasmonics, and overcomes the losses seen in conventional plasmonic materials. In particular, extrinsic doping pins the CdO Fermi level above the conduction band minimum and it increases the formation energy of native oxygen vacancies, thus reducing their populations by several orders of magnitude. The substitutional lattice strain induced by Dy doping is sufficiently small, allowing mobility values around 500 cm2 V−1 s−1 for carrier densities above 1020 cm−3. Our work shows that CdO:Dy is a model system for intrinsic and extrinsic manipulation of defects affecting electrical, optical and thermal properties, that oxide conductors are ideal candidates for plasmonic devices and that the defect engineering approach for property optimization is generally applicable to other conducting metal oxides."
836,Hydraulic fracture during epithelial stretching,2015-02-09,"The origin of fracture in epithelial cell sheets subject to stretch is commonly attributed to excess tension in the cells’ cytoskeleton, in the plasma membrane, or in cell–cell contacts. Here, we demonstrate that for a variety of synthetic and physiological hydrogel substrates the formation of epithelial cracks is caused by tissue stretching independently of epithelial tension. We show that the origin of the cracks is hydraulic; they result from a transient pressure build-up in the substrate during stretch and compression manoeuvres. After pressure equilibration, cracks heal readily through actomyosin-dependent mechanisms. The observed phenomenology is captured by the theory of poroelasticity, which predicts the size and healing dynamics of epithelial cracks as a function of the stiffness, geometry and composition of the hydrogel substrate. Our findings demonstrate that epithelial integrity is determined in a tension-independent manner by the coupling between tissue stretching and matrix hydraulics."
837,Curvature-induced symmetry breaking determines elastic surface patterns,2015-02-02,"Symmetry-breaking transitions associated with the buckling and folding of curved multilayered surfaces—which are common to a wide range of systems and processes such as embryogenesis, tissue differentiation and structure formation in heterogeneous thin films or on planetary surfaces—have been characterized experimentally. Yet owing to the nonlinearity of the underlying stretching and bending forces, the transitions cannot be reliably predicted by current theoretical models. Here, we report a generalized Swift–Hohenberg theory that describes wrinkling morphology and pattern selection in curved elastic bilayer materials. By testing the theory against experiments on spherically shaped surfaces, we find quantitative agreement with analytical predictions for the critical curves separating labyrinth, hybrid and hexagonal phases. Furthermore, a comparison to earlier experiments suggests that the theory is universally applicable to macroscopic and microscopic systems. Our approach builds on general differential-geometry principles and can thus be extended to arbitrarily shaped surfaces."
838,A design strategy for intramolecular singlet fission mediated by charge-transfer states in donor–acceptor organic materials,2015-01-12,"The ability to advance our understanding of multiple exciton generation (MEG) in organic materials has been restricted by the limited number of materials capable of singlet fission. A particular challenge is the development of materials that undergo efficient intramolecular fission, such that local order and strong nearest-neighbour coupling is no longer a design constraint. Here we address these challenges by demonstrating that strong intrachain donor–acceptor interactions are a key design feature for organic materials capable of intramolecular singlet fission. By conjugating strong-acceptor and strong-donor building blocks, small molecules and polymers with charge-transfer states that mediate population transfer between singlet excitons and triplet excitons are synthesized. Using transient optical techniques, we show that triplet populations can be generated with yields up to 170%. These guidelines are widely applicable to similar families of polymers and small molecules, and can lead to the development of new fission-capable materials with tunable electronic structure, as well as a deeper fundamental understanding of MEG."
839,"Experimental demonstration of hybrid improper ferroelectricity and the presence of abundant charged walls in (Ca,Sr)",2015-01-12,"On the basis of successful first-principles predictions of new functional ferroelectric materials, a number of new ferroelectrics have been experimentally discovered. Using trilinear coupling of two types of octahedron rotation, hybrid improper ferroelectricity has been theoretically predicted in ordered perovskites and the Ruddlesden–Popper compounds (Ca3Ti2O7, Ca3Mn2O7 and (Ca/Sr/Ba)3(Sn/Zr/Ge)2O7). However, the ferroelectricity of these compounds has never been experimentally confirmed and even their polar nature has been under debate. Here we provide the first experimental demonstration of room-temperature switchable polarization in bulk crystals of Ca3Ti2O7, as well as Sr-doped Ca3Ti2O7. Furthermore, (Ca, Sr)3Ti2O7 is found to exhibit an intriguing ferroelectric domain structure resulting from orthorhombic twins and (switchable) planar polarization. The planar domain structure accompanies abundant charged domain walls with conducting head-to-head and insulating tail-to-tail configurations, which exhibit a conduction difference of two orders of magnitude. These discoveries provide new research opportunities, not only for new stable ferroelectrics of Ruddlesden–Popper compounds, but also for meandering conducting domain walls formed by planar polarization."
840,Epitaxy of semiconductor–superconductor nanowires,2015-01-12,"Controlling the properties of semiconductor/metal interfaces is a powerful method for designing functionality and improving the performance of electrical devices. Recently semiconductor/superconductor hybrids have appeared as an important example where the atomic scale uniformity of the interface plays a key role in determining the quality of the induced superconducting gap. Here we present epitaxial growth of semiconductor–metal core–shell nanowires by molecular beam epitaxy, a method that provides a conceptually new route to controlled electrical contacting of nanostructures and the design of devices for specialized applications such as topological and gate-controlled superconducting electronics. Our materials of choice, InAs/Al grown with epitaxially matched single-plane interfaces, and alternative semiconductor/metal combinations allowing epitaxial interface matching in nanowires are discussed. We formulate the grain growth kinetics of the metal phase in general terms of continuum parameters and bicrystal symmetries. The method realizes the ultimate limit of uniform interfaces and seems to solve the soft-gap problem in superconducting hybrid structures."
841,Template-free nanosized faujasite-type zeolites,2015-01-05,"Nanosized faujasite (FAU) crystals have great potential as catalysts or adsorbents to more efficiently process present and forthcoming synthetic and renewable feedstocks in oil refining, petrochemistry and fine chemistry. Here, we report the rational design of template-free nanosized FAU zeolites with exceptional properties, including extremely small crystallites (10–15 nm) with a narrow particle size distribution, high crystalline yields (above 80%), micropore volumes (0.30 cm3 g−1) comparable to their conventional counterparts (micrometre-sized crystals), Si/Al ratios adjustable between 1.1 and 2.1 (zeolites X or Y) and excellent thermal stability leading to superior catalytic performance in the dealkylation of a bulky molecule, 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene, probing sites mostly located on the external surface of the nanosized crystals. Another important feature is their excellent colloidal stability, which facilitates a uniform dispersion on supports for applications in catalysis, sorption and thin-to-thick coatings."
842,Eliminating degradation in solid oxide electrochemical cells by reversible operation,2014-12-22,"One promising energy storage technology is the solid oxide electrochemical cell (SOC), which can both store electricity as chemical fuels (electrolysis mode) and convert fuels to electricity (fuel-cell mode). The widespread use of SOCs has been hindered by insufficient long-term stability, in particular at high current densities. Here we demonstrate that severe electrolysis-induced degradation, which was previously believed to be irreversible, can be completely eliminated by reversibly cycling between electrolysis and fuel-cell modes, similar to a rechargeable battery. Performing steam electrolysis continuously at high current density (1 A cm−2), initially at 1.33 V (97% energy efficiency), led to severe microstructure deterioration near the oxygen-electrode/electrolyte interface and a corresponding large increase in ohmic resistance. After 4,000 h of reversible cycling, however, no microstructural damage was observed and the ohmic resistance even slightly improved. The results demonstrate the viability of applying SOCs for renewable electricity storage at previously unattainable reaction rates, and have implications for our fundamental understanding of degradation mechanisms that are usually assumed to be irreversible."
843,Highly confined low-loss plasmons in graphene–boron nitride heterostructures,2014-12-22,"Graphene plasmons were predicted to possess simultaneous ultrastrong field confinement and very low damping, enabling new classes of devices for deep-subwavelength metamaterials, single-photon nonlinearities, extraordinarily strong light–matter interactions and nano-optoelectronic switches. Although all of these great prospects require low damping, thus far strong plasmon damping has been observed, with both impurity scattering and many-body effects in graphene proposed as possible explanations. With the advent of van der Waals heterostructures, new methods have been developed to integrate graphene with other atomically flat materials. In this Article we exploit near-field microscopy to image propagating plasmons in high-quality graphene encapsulated between two films of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). We determine the dispersion and plasmon damping in real space. We find unprecedentedly low plasmon damping combined with strong field confinement and confirm the high uniformity of this plasmonic medium. The main damping channels are attributed to intrinsic thermal phonons in the graphene and dielectric losses in the h-BN. The observation and in-depth understanding of low plasmon damping is the key to the development of graphene nanophotonic and nano-optoelectronic devices."
844,Impact of mesoscale order on open-circuit voltage in organic solar cells,2014-12-22,"Structural order in organic solar cells is paramount: it reduces energetic disorder, boosts charge and exciton mobilities, and assists exciton splitting. Owing to spatial localization of electronic states, microscopic descriptions of photovoltaic processes tend to overlook the influence of structural features at the mesoscale. Long-range electrostatic interactions nevertheless probe this ordering, making local properties depend on the mesoscopic order. Using a technique developed to address spatially aperiodic excitations in thin films and in bulk, we show how inclusion of mesoscale order resolves the controversy between experimental and theoretical results for the energy-level profile and alignment in a variety of photovoltaic systems, with direct experimental validation. Optimal use of long-range ordering also rationalizes the acceptor–donor–acceptor paradigm for molecular design of donor dyes. We predict open-circuit voltages of planar heterojunction solar cells in excellent agreement with experimental data, based only on crystal structures and interfacial orientation."
845,Coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in (Li,2014-12-15,"Iron selenide superconductors exhibit a number of unique characteristics that are helpful for understanding the mechanism of superconductivity in high-Tc iron-based superconductors more generally. However, in the case of AxFe2Se2 (A = K, Rb, Cs), the presence of an intergrown antiferromagnetic insulating phase makes the study of the underlying physics problematic. Moreover, FeSe-based systems intercalated with alkali metal ions, NH3 molecules or organic molecules are extremely sensitive to air, which prevents the further investigation of their physical properties. It is therefore desirable to find a stable and easily accessible FeSe-based superconductor to study its physical properties in detail. Here, we report the synthesis of an air-stable material, (Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe, which remains superconducting at temperatures up to ~40 K, by means of a novel hydrothermal method. The crystal structure is unambiguously determined by a combination of X-ray and neutron powder diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance. Moreover, antiferromagnetic order is shown to coexist with superconductivity. This synthetic route opens a path for exploring superconductivity in other related systems, and confirms the appeal of iron selenides as a platform for understanding superconductivity in iron pnictides more broadly."
846,Light-triggered ,2014-12-15,"Materials engineered to elicit targeted cellular responses in regenerative medicine must display bioligands with precise spatial and temporal control. Although materials with temporally regulated presentation of bioadhesive ligands using external triggers, such as light and electric fields, have recently been realized for cells in culture, the impact of in vivo temporal ligand presentation on cell–material responses is unknown. Here, we present a general strategy to temporally and spatially control the in vivo presentation of bioligands using cell-adhesive peptides with a protecting group that can be easily removed via transdermal light exposure to render the peptide fully active. We demonstrate that non-invasive, transdermal time-regulated activation of cell-adhesive RGD peptide on implanted biomaterials regulates in vivo cell adhesion, inflammation, fibrous encapsulation, and vascularization of the material. This work shows that triggered in vivo presentation of bioligands can be harnessed to direct tissue reparative responses associated with implanted biomaterials."
847,High H,2014-12-08,"With hydrogen being seen as a key renewable energy vector, the search for materials exhibiting fast hydrogen transport becomes ever more important. Not only do hydrogen storage materials require high mobility of hydrogen in the solid state, but the efficiency of electrochemical devices is also largely determined by fast ionic transport. Although the heavy alkaline-earth hydrides are of limited interest for their hydrogen storage potential, owing to low gravimetric densities, their ionic nature may prove useful in new electrochemical applications, especially as an ionically conducting electrolyte material. Here we show that barium hydride shows fast pure ionic transport of hydride ions (H−) in the high-temperature, high-symmetry phase. Although some conductivity studies have been reported on related materials previously, the nature of the charge carriers has not been determined. BaH2 gives rise to hydride ion conductivity of 0.2 S cm−1 at 630 °C. This is an order of magnitude larger than that of state-of-the-art proton-conducting perovskites or oxide ion conductors at this temperature. These results suggest that the alkaline-earth hydrides form an important new family of materials, with potential use in a number of applications, such as separation membranes, electrochemical reactors and so on."
848,Computational self-assembly of a one-component icosahedral quasicrystal,2014-12-08,"Icosahedral quasicrystals (IQCs) are a form of matter that is ordered but not periodic in any direction. All reported IQCs are intermetallic compounds and either of face-centred-icosahedral or primitive-icosahedral type, and the positions of their atoms have been resolved from diffraction data. However, unlike axially symmetric quasicrystals, IQCs have not been observed in non-atomic (that is, micellar or nanoparticle) systems, where real-space information would be directly available. Here, we show that an IQC can be assembled by means of molecular dynamics simulations from a one-component system of particles interacting via a tunable, isotropic pair potential extending only to the third-neighbour shell. The IQC is body-centred, self-assembles from a fluid phase, and in parameter space neighbours clathrates and other tetrahedrally bonded crystals. Our findings elucidate the structure and dynamics of the IQC, and suggest routes to search for it and design it in soft matter and nanoscale systems."
849,Highly efficient blue electroluminescence based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence,2014-12-08,"Organic compounds that exhibit highly efficient, stable blue emission are required to realize inexpensive organic light-emitting diodes for future displays and lighting applications. Here, we define the design rules for increasing the electroluminescence efficiency of blue-emitting organic molecules that exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence. We show that a large delocalization of the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital in these charge-transfer compounds enhances the rate of radiative decay considerably by inducing a large oscillator strength even when there is a small overlap between the two wavefunctions. A compound based on our design principles exhibited a high rate of fluorescence decay and efficient up-conversion of triplet excitons into singlet excited states, leading to both photoluminescence and internal electroluminescence quantum yields of nearly 100%."
850,Origin of voltage decay in high-capacity layered oxide electrodes,2014-12-01,"Although Li-rich layered oxides (Li1+xNiyCozMn1−x−y−zO2 > 250 mAh g−1) are attractive electrode materials providing energy densities more than 15% higher than today’s commercial Li-ion cells, they suffer from voltage decay on cycling. To elucidate the origin of this phenomenon, we employ chemical substitution in structurally related Li2RuO3 compounds. Li-rich layered Li2Ru1−yTiyO3 phases with capacities of ~240 mAh g−1 exhibit the characteristic voltage decay on cycling. A combination of transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies reveals that the migration of cations between metal layers and Li layers is an intrinsic feature of the charge–discharge process that increases the trapping of metal ions in interstitial tetrahedral sites. A correlation between these trapped ions and the voltage decay is established by expanding the study to both Li2Ru1−ySnyO3 and Li2RuO3; the slowest decay occurs for the cations with the largest ionic radii. This effect is robust, and the finding provides insights into new chemistry to be explored for developing high-capacity layered electrodes that evade voltage decay."
851,Breaking of macroscopic centric symmetry in paraelectric phases of ferroelectric materials and implications for flexoelectricity,2014-11-17,"A centrosymmetric stress cannot induce a polar response in centric materials; piezoelectricity is, for example, possible only in non-centrosymmetric structures. An exception is metamaterials with shape asymmetry, which may be polarized by stress even when the material is centric. In this case the mechanism is flexoelectricity, which relates polarization to a strain gradient. The flexoelectric response scales inversely with size, thus a large effect is expected in nanoscale materials. Recent experiments in polycrystalline, centrosymmetric perovskites (for example, (Ba, Sr)TiO3) have indicated values of flexoelectric coefficients that are orders of magnitude higher than theoretically predicted, promising practical applications based on bulk materials. We show that materials with unexpectedly large flexoelectric response exhibit breaking of the macroscopic centric symmetry through inhomogeneity induced by the high-temperature processing. The emerging electro-mechanical coupling is significant and may help to resolve the controversy surrounding the large apparent flexoelectric coefficients in this class of materials."
852,Orbital-driven nematicity in FeSe,2014-11-10,"A fundamental and unconventional characteristic of superconductivity in iron-based materials is that it occurs in the vicinity of two other instabilities. In addition to a tendency towards magnetic order, these Fe-based systems have a propensity for nematic ordering: a lowering of the rotational symmetry while time-reversal invariance is preserved. Setting the stage for superconductivity, it is heavily debated whether the nematic symmetry breaking is driven by lattice, orbital or spin degrees of freedom. Here, we report a very clear splitting of NMR resonance lines in FeSe at Tnem = 91 K, far above the superconducting Tc of 9.3 K. The splitting occurs for magnetic fields perpendicular to the Fe planes and has the temperature dependence of a Landau-type order parameter. Spin–lattice relaxation rates are not affected at Tnem, which unequivocally establishes orbital degrees of freedom as driving the nematic order. We demonstrate that superconductivity competes with the emerging nematicity."
853,Actuation of shape-memory colloidal fibres of Janus ellipsoids,2014-11-10,"Many natural micrometre-scale assemblies can be actuated to control their optical, transport and mechanical properties, yet such functionality is lacking in colloidal structures synthesized thus far. Here, we show with experiments and computer simulations that Janus ellipsoids can self-assemble into self-limiting one-dimensional fibres with shape-memory properties, and that the fibrillar assemblies can be actuated on application of an external alternating-current electric field. Actuation of the fibres occurs through a sliding mechanism that permits the rapid and reversible elongation and contraction of the Janus-ellipsoid chains by ~36% and that on long timescales leads to the generation of long, uniform self-assembled fibres. Colloidal-scale actuation might be useful in microrobotics and in applications of shape-memory materials."
854,Designer amphiphilic proteins as building blocks for the intracellular formation of organelle-like compartments,2014-11-02,"Nanoscale biological materials formed by the assembly of defined block-domain proteins control the formation of cellular compartments such as organelles. Here, we introduce an approach to intentionally ‘program’ the de novo synthesis and self-assembly of genetically encoded amphiphilic proteins to form cellular compartments, or organelles, in Escherichia coli. These proteins serve as building blocks for the formation of artificial compartments in vivo in a similar way to lipid-based organelles. We investigated the formation of these organelles using epifluorescence microscopy, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The in vivo modification of these protein-based de novo organelles, by means of site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids, allows the introduction of artificial chemical functionalities. Co-localization of membrane proteins results in the formation of functionalized artificial organelles combining artificial and natural cellular function. Adding these protein structures to the cellular machinery may have consequences in nanobiotechnology, synthetic biology and materials science, including the constitution of artificial cells and bio-based metamaterials."
855,Heterogeneous nucleation and shape transformation of multicomponent metallic nanostructures,2014-11-02,"To be able to control the functions of engineered multicomponent nanomaterials, a detailed understanding of heterogeneous nucleation at the nanoscale is essential. Here, by using in situ synchrotron X-ray scattering, we show that in the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of Au on Pt or Pt-alloy seeds the heteroepitaxial growth of the Au shell exerts high stress (∼2 GPa) on the seed by forming a core/shell structure in the early stage of the reaction. The development of lattice strain and subsequent strain relaxation, which we show using atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy to occur through the slip of {111} layers, induces morphological changes from a core/shell to a dumbbell structure, and governs the nucleation and growth kinetics. We also propose a thermodynamic model for the nucleation and growth of dumbbell metallic heteronanostructures."
856,Giant barocaloric effect enhanced by the frustration of the antiferromagnetic phase in Mn,2014-10-26,"First-order phase transitions are accompanied by a latent heat. Consequently, manipulating them by means of an external field causes a caloric effect. Although transitions from antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic states are not controlled by a magnetic field, a large barocaloric effect is expected when strong cross-correlations between the volume and magnetic order occur. Here we examine how geometric frustration in itinerant antiferromagnetic compounds can enhance the barocaloric effect. We study the thermodynamic behaviour of the frustrated antiferromagnet Mn3GaN, and report an entropy change of 22.3 J kg−1 K−1 that is concomitant with a hydrostatic pressure change of 139 MPa. Furthermore, the calculated value of the adiabatic temperature change reaches 5 K by depressurization of 93 MPa. The giant barocaloric effect in Mn3GaN is caused by a frustration-driven enhancement of the ratio of volume change against the pressure coefficient of the Néel temperature. This mechanism for enhancing the barocaloric effect can form the basis for a new class of materials for solid-state refrigerants."
857,Ferroelectric polarization reversal via successive ferroelastic transitions,2014-10-26,"Switchable polarization makes ferroelectrics a critical component in memories, actuators and electro-optic devices, and potential candidates for nanoelectronics. Although many studies of ferroelectric switching have been undertaken, much remains to be understood about switching in complex domain structures and in devices. In this work, a combination of thin-film epitaxy, macro- and nanoscale property and switching characterization, and molecular dynamics simulations are used to elucidate the nature of switching in PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films. Differences are demonstrated between (001)-/(101)- and (111)-oriented films, with the latter exhibiting complex, nanotwinned ferroelectric domain structures with high densities of 90° domain walls and considerably broadened switching characteristics. Molecular dynamics simulations predict both 180° (for (001)-/(101)-oriented films) and 90° multi-step switching (for (111)-oriented films) and these processes are subsequently observed in stroboscopic piezoresponse force microscopy. These results have implications for our understanding of ferroelectric switching and offer opportunities to change domain reversal speed."
858,Multimodal plasmonics in fused colloidal networks,2014-10-26,"Harnessing the optical properties of noble metals down to the nanometre scale is a key step towards fast and low-dissipative information processing. At the 10-nm length scale, metal crystallinity and patterning as well as probing of surface plasmon properties must be controlled with a challenging high level of precision. Here, we demonstrate that ultimate lateral confinement and delocalization of surface plasmon modes are simultaneously achieved in extended self-assembled networks comprising linear chains of partially fused gold nanoparticles. The spectral and spatial distributions of the surface plasmon modes associated with the colloidal superstructures are evidenced by performing monochromated electron energy-loss spectroscopy with a nanometre-sized electron probe. We prepare the metallic bead strings by electron-beam-induced interparticle fusion of nanoparticle networks. The fused superstructures retain the native morphology and crystallinity but develop very low-energy surface plasmon modes that are capable of supporting long-range and spectrally tunable propagation in nanoscale waveguides."
859,Resonant energy transfer of triplet excitons from pentacene to PbSe nanocrystals,2014-10-05,"The efficient transfer of energy between organic and inorganic semiconductors is a widely sought after property, but has so far been limited to the transfer of spin-singlet excitons. Here we report efficient resonant-energy transfer of molecular spin-triplet excitons from organic semiconductors to inorganic semiconductors. We use ultrafast optical absorption spectroscopy to track the dynamics of triplets, generated in pentacene through singlet exciton fission, at the interface with lead selenide (PbSe) nanocrystals. We show that triplets transfer to PbSe rapidly (<1 ps) and efficiently, with 1.9 triplets transferred for every photon absorbed in pentacene, but only when the bandgap of the nanocrystals is close to resonance (±0.2 eV) with the triplet energy. Following triplet transfer, the excitation can undergo either charge separation, allowing photovoltaic operation, or radiative recombination in the nanocrystal, enabling luminescent harvesting of triplet exciton energy in light-emitting structures."
860,Energy harvesting of non-emissive triplet excitons in tetracene by emissive PbS nanocrystals,2014-10-05,"Triplet excitons are ubiquitous in organic optoelectronics, but they are often an undesirable energy sink because they are spin-forbidden from emitting light and their high binding energy hinders the generation of free electron–hole pairs. Harvesting their energy is consequently an important technological challenge. Here, we demonstrate direct excitonic energy transfer from ‘dark’ triplets in the organic semiconductor tetracene to colloidal PbS nanocrystals, thereby successfully harnessing molecular triplet excitons in the near infrared. Steady-state excitation spectra, supported by transient photoluminescence studies, demonstrate that the transfer efficiency is at least (90 ± 13)%. The mechanism is a Dexter hopping process consisting of the simultaneous exchange of two electrons. Triplet exciton transfer to nanocrystals is expected to be broadly applicable in solar and near-infrared light-emitting applications, where effective molecular phosphors are lacking at present. In particular, this route to ‘brighten’ low-energy molecular triplet excitons may permit singlet exciton fission sensitization of conventional silicon solar cells."
861,Oligopeptide complex for targeted non-viral gene delivery to adipocytes,2014-10-05,"Commercial anti-obesity drugs acting in the gastrointestinal tract or the central nervous system have been shown to have limited efficacy and severe side effects. Anti-obesity drug development is thus focusing on targeting adipocytes that store excess fat. Here, we show that an adipocyte-targeting fusion-oligopeptide gene carrier consisting of an adipocyte-targeting sequence and 9-arginine (ATS–9R) selectively transfects mature adipocytes by binding to prohibitin. Injection of ATS–9R into obese mice confirmed specific binding of ATS–9R to fat vasculature, internalization and gene expression in adipocytes. We also constructed a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) for silencing fatty-acid-binding protein 4 (shFABP4), a key lipid chaperone in fatty-acid uptake and lipid storage in adipocytes. Treatment of obese mice with ATS–9R/shFABP4 led to metabolic recovery and body-weight reduction (>20%). The ATS–9R/shFABP4 oligopeptide complex could prove to be a safe therapeutic approach to regress and treat obesity as well as obesity-induced metabolic syndromes."
862,Extreme electronic bandgap modification in laser-crystallized silicon optical fibres,2014-09-28,"For decades now, silicon has been the workhorse of the microelectronics revolution and a key enabler of the information age. Owing to its excellent optical properties in the near- and mid-infrared, silicon is now promising to have a similar impact on photonics. The ability to incorporate both optical and electronic functionality in a single material offers the tantalizing prospect of amplifying, modulating and detecting light within a monolithic platform. However, a direct consequence of silicon’s transparency is that it cannot be used to detect light at telecommunications wavelengths. Here, we report on a laser processing technique developed for our silicon fibre technology through which we can modify the electronic band structure of the semiconductor material as it is crystallized. The unique fibre geometry in which the silicon core is confined within a silica cladding allows large anisotropic stresses to be set into the crystalline material so that the size of the bandgap can be engineered. We demonstrate extreme bandgap reductions from 1.11 eV down to 0.59 eV, enabling optical detection out to 2,100 nm."
863,Direct correlation of single-molecule properties with bulk mechanical performance for the biomimetic design of polymers,2014-09-28,"For rational design of advanced polymeric materials, it is critical to establish a clear mechanistic link between the molecular structure of a polymer and the emergent bulk mechanical properties. Despite progress towards this goal, it remains a major challenge to directly correlate the bulk mechanical performance to the nanomechanical properties of individual constituent macromolecules. Here, we show a direct correlation between the single-molecule nanomechanical properties of a biomimetic modular polymer and the mechanical characteristics of the resulting bulk material. The multi-cyclic single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) data enabled quantitative derivation of the asymmetric potential energy profile of individual module rupture and re-folding, in which a steep dissociative pathway accounted for the high plateau modulus, while a shallow associative well explained the energy-dissipative hysteresis and dynamic, adaptive recovery. These results demonstrate the potential for SMFS to serve as a guide for future rational design of advanced multifunctional materials."
864,Vertical and in-plane heterostructures from WS,2014-09-28,"Layer-by-layer stacking or lateral interfacing of atomic monolayers has opened up unprecedented opportunities to engineer two-dimensional heteromaterials. Fabrication of such artificial heterostructures with atomically clean and sharp interfaces, however, is challenging. Here, we report a one-step growth strategy for the creation of high-quality vertically stacked as well as in-plane interconnected heterostructures of WS2/MoS2 via control of the growth temperature. Vertically stacked bilayers with WS2 epitaxially grown on top of the MoS2 monolayer are formed with preferred stacking order at high temperature. A strong interlayer excitonic transition is observed due to the type II band alignment and to the clean interface of these bilayers. Vapour growth at low temperature, on the other hand, leads to lateral epitaxy of WS2 on MoS2 edges, creating seamless and atomically sharp in-plane heterostructures that generate strong localized photoluminescence enhancement and intrinsic p–n junctions. The fabrication of heterostructures from monolayers, using simple and scalable growth, paves the way for the creation of unprecedented two-dimensional materials with exciting properties."
865,Determination of the 3D shape of a nanoscale crystal with atomic resolution from a single image,2014-09-21,"Although the overall atomic structure of a nanoscale crystal is in principle accessible by modern transmission electron microscopy, the precise determination of its surface structure is an intricate problem. Here, we show that aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, combined with dedicated numerical evaluation procedures, allows the three-dimensional shape of a thin MgO crystal to be determined from only one single high-resolution image. The sensitivity of the reconstruction procedure is not only sufficient to reveal the surface morphology of the crystal with atomic resolution, but also to detect the presence of adsorbed impurity atoms. The single-image approach that we introduce offers important advantages for three-dimensional studies of radiation-sensitive crystals."
866,Topologically protected excitons in porphyrin thin films,2014-09-21,"The control of exciton transport in organic materials is of fundamental importance for the development of efficient light-harvesting systems. This transport is easily deteriorated by traps in the disordered energy landscape. Here, we propose and analyse a system that supports topological Frenkel exciton edge states. Backscattering of these chiral Frenkel excitons is prohibited by symmetry, ensuring that the transport properties of such a system are robust against disorder. To implement our idea, we propose a two-dimensional periodic array of tilted porphyrins interacting with a homogeneous magnetic field. This field serves to break time-reversal symmetry and results in lattice fluxes that mimic the Aharonov–Bohm phase acquired by electrons. Our proposal is the first blueprint for realizing topological phases of matter in molecular aggregates and suggests a paradigm for engineering novel excitonic materials."
867,Atomic structure and dynamic behaviour of truly one-dimensional ionic chains inside carbon nanotubes,2014-09-14,"Materials with reduced dimensionality have attracted much interest in various fields of fundamental and applied science. True one-dimensional (1D) crystals with single-atom thickness have been realized only for few elemental metals (Au, Ag) or carbon, all of which showed very short lifetimes under ambient conditions. We demonstrate here a successful synthesis of stable 1D ionic crystals in which two chemical elements, one being a cation and the other an anion, align alternately inside carbon nanotubes. Unusual dynamical behaviours for different atoms in the 1D lattice are experimentally corroborated and suggest substantial interactions of the atoms with the nanotube sheath. Our theoretical studies indicate that the 1D ionic crystals have optical properties distinct from those of their bulk counterparts and that the properties can be engineered by introducing atomic defects into the chains."
868,Digital metamaterials,2014-09-14,"Balancing complexity and simplicity has played an important role in the development of many fields in science and engineering. One of the well-known and powerful examples of such balance can be found in Boolean algebra and its impact on the birth of digital electronics and the digital information age. The simplicity of using only two numbers, ‘0’ and ‘1’, in a binary system for describing an arbitrary quantity made the fields of digital electronics and digital signal processing powerful and ubiquitous. Here, inspired by the binary concept, we propose to develop the notion of digital metamaterials. Specifically, we investigate how one can synthesize an electromagnetic metamaterial with a desired permittivity, using as building blocks only two elemental materials, which we call ‘metamaterial bits’, with two distinct permittivity functions. We demonstrate, analytically and numerically, how proper spatial mixtures of such metamaterial bits lead to elemental ‘metamaterial bytes’ with effective material parameters that are different from the parameters of the metamaterial bits. We then apply this methodology to several design examples of optical elements, such as digital convex lenses, flat graded-index digital lenses, digital constructs for epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) supercoupling and digital hyperlenses, thus highlighting the power and simplicity of the methodology."
869,Two-step nucleation mechanism in solid–solid phase transitions,2014-09-14,"The microscopic kinetics of ubiquitous solid–solid phase transitions remain poorly understood. Here, by using single-particle-resolution video microscopy of colloidal films of diameter-tunable microspheres, we show that transitions between square and triangular lattices occur via a two-step diffusive nucleation pathway involving liquid nuclei. The nucleation pathway is favoured over the direct one-step nucleation because the energy of the solid/liquid interface is lower than that between solid phases. We also observed that nucleation precursors are particle-swapping loops rather than newly generated structural defects, and that coherent and incoherent facets of the evolving nuclei exhibit different energies and growth rates that can markedly alter the nucleation kinetics. Our findings suggest that an intermediate liquid should exist in the nucleation processes of solid–solid transitions of most metals and alloys, and provide guidance for better control of the kinetics of the transition and for future refinements of solid–solid transition theory."
870,Current-induced transition from particle-by-particle to concurrent intercalation in phase-separating battery electrodes,2014-09-14,"Many battery electrodes contain ensembles of nanoparticles that phase-separate on (de)intercalation. In such electrodes, the fraction of actively intercalating particles directly impacts cycle life: a vanishing population concentrates the current in a small number of particles, leading to current hotspots. Reports of the active particle population in the phase-separating electrode lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4; LFP) vary widely, ranging from near 0% (particle-by-particle) to 100% (concurrent intercalation). Using synchrotron-based X-ray microscopy, we probed the individual state-of-charge for over 3,000 LFP particles. We observed that the active population depends strongly on the cycling current, exhibiting particle-by-particle-like behaviour at low rates and increasingly concurrent behaviour at high rates, consistent with our phase-field porous electrode simulations. Contrary to intuition, the current density, or current per active internal surface area, is nearly invariant with the global electrode cycling rate. Rather, the electrode accommodates higher current by increasing the active particle population. This behaviour results from thermodynamic transformation barriers in LFP, and such a phenomenon probably extends to other phase-separating battery materials. We propose that modifying the transformation barrier and exchange current density can increase the active population and thus the current homogeneity. This could introduce new paradigms to enhance the cycle life of phase-separating battery electrodes."
871, detection of hydrogen-induced phase transitions in individual palladium nanocrystals,2014-09-07,"Many energy- and information-storage processes rely on phase changes of nanomaterials in reactive environments. Compared to their bulk counterparts, nanostructured materials seem to exhibit faster charging and discharging kinetics, extended life cycles, and size-tunable thermodynamics. However, in ensemble studies of these materials, it is often difficult to discriminate between intrinsic size-dependent properties and effects due to sample size and shape dispersity. Here, we detect the phase transitions of individual palladium nanocrystals during hydrogen absorption and desorption, using in situ electron energy-loss spectroscopy in an environmental transmission electron microscope. In contrast to ensemble measurements, we find that palladium nanocrystals undergo sharp transitions between the α and β phases, and that surface effects dictate the size dependence of the hydrogen absorption pressures. Our results provide a general framework for monitoring phase transitions in individual nanocrystals in a reactive environment and highlight the importance of single-particle approaches for the characterization of nanostructured materials."
872,Large reverse saturable absorption under weak continuous incoherent light,2014-09-07,"In materials showing reverse saturable absorption (RSA), the optical absorbance increases as the power of the light incident on them increases. To date, RSA has only been observed when very intense light sources, such as short-pulse lasers, are used. Here, we show that hydroxyl steroidal matrices embedding properly designed aromatic molecules as acceptors and transition-metal complexes as donors exhibit high RSA on exposure to weak incoherent light at room temperature and in air. Accumulation by photosensitization of long-lived room-temperature triplet excitons in acceptors with a large triplet–triplet absorption coefficient allows a nonlinear increase in absorbance also under low-power irradiation conditions. As a consequence, continuous exposure to weak light significantly decreases the transmittance of thin films fabricated with these compounds. These optical limiting properties may be used to protect eyes and light sensors from exposure to intense radiation generated by incoherent sources and for other light-absorption applications that have not been realized with conventional RSA materials."
873,Phase-engineered low-resistance contacts for ultrathin MoS,2014-08-31,"Ultrathin molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) has emerged as an interesting layered semiconductor because of its finite energy bandgap and the absence of dangling bonds. However, metals deposited on the semiconducting 2H phase usually form high-resistance (0.7 kΩ μm–10 kΩ μm) contacts, leading to Schottky-limited transport. In this study, we demonstrate that the metallic 1T phase of MoS2 can be locally induced on semiconducting 2H phase nanosheets, thus decreasing contact resistances to 200–300 Ω μm at zero gate bias. Field-effect transistors (FETs) with 1T phase electrodes fabricated and tested in air exhibit mobility values of ~50 cm2 V−1 s−1, subthreshold swing values below 100 mV per decade, on/off ratios of >107, drive currents approaching ~100 μA μm−1, and excellent current saturation. The deposition of different metals has limited influence on the FET performance, suggesting that the 1T/2H interface controls carrier injection into the channel. An increased reproducibility of the electrical characteristics is also obtained with our strategy based on phase engineering of MoS2."
874,Nanoelectrical analysis of single molecules and atomic-scale materials at the solid/liquid interface,2014-08-17,"Evaluating the built-in functionality of nanomaterials under practical conditions is central for their proposed integration as active components in next-generation electronics. Low-dimensional materials from single atoms to molecules have been consistently resolved and manipulated under ultrahigh vacuum at low temperatures. At room temperature, atomic-scale imaging has also been performed by probing materials at the solid/liquid interface. We exploit this electrical interface to develop a robust electronic decoupling platform that provides precise information on molecular energy levels recorded using in situ scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy with high spatial and energy resolution in a high-density liquid environment. Our experimental findings, supported by ab initio electronic structure calculations and atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations, reveal direct mapping of single-molecule structure and resonance states at the solid/liquid interface. We further extend this approach to resolve the electronic structure of graphene monolayers at atomic length scales under standard room-temperature operating conditions."
875,Direct observation of ferroelectric field effect and vacancy-controlled screening at the BiFeO,2014-08-17,"The development of interface-based magnetoelectric devices necessitates an understanding of polarization-mediated electronic phenomena and atomistic polarization screening mechanisms. In this work, the LSMO/BFO interface is studied on a single unit-cell level through a combination of direct order parameter mapping by scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. We demonstrate an unexpected ~5% lattice expansion for regions with negative polarization charge, with a concurrent anomalous decrease of the Mn valence and change in oxygen K-edge intensity. We interpret this behaviour as direct evidence for screening by oxygen vacancies. The vacancies are predominantly accumulated at the second atomic layer of BFO, reflecting the difference of ionic conductivity between the components. This vacancy exclusion from the interface leads to the formation of a tail-to-tail domain wall. At the same time, purely electronic screening is realized for positive polarization charge, with insignificant changes in lattice and electronic properties. These results underline the non-trivial role of electrochemical phenomena in determining the functional properties of oxide interfaces. Furthermore, these behaviours suggest that vacancy dynamics and exclusion play major roles in determining interface functionality in oxide multilayers, providing clear implications for novel functionalities in potential electronic devices."
876,Collective and individual migration following the epithelial–mesenchymal transition,2014-08-17,"During cancer progression, malignant cells in the tumour invade surrounding tissues. This transformation of adherent cells to a motile phenotype has been associated with the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we show that EMT-activated cells migrate through micropillar arrays as a collectively advancing front that scatters individual cells. Individual cells with few neighbours dispersed with fast, straight trajectories, whereas cells that encountered many neighbours migrated collectively with epithelial biomarkers. We modelled these emergent dynamics using a physical analogy to phase transitions during binary-mixture solidification, and validated it using drug perturbations, which revealed that individually migrating cells exhibit diminished chemosensitivity. Our measurements also indicate a degree of phenotypic plasticity as cells interconvert between individual and collective migration. The study of multicellular behaviours with single-cell resolution should enable further quantitative insights into heterogeneous tumour invasion."
877,Interplay of matrix stiffness and protein tethering in stem cell differentiation,2014-08-10,"Stem cells regulate their fate by binding to, and contracting against, the extracellular matrix. Recently, it has been proposed that in addition to matrix stiffness and ligand type, the degree of coupling of fibrous protein to the surface of the underlying substrate, that is, tethering and matrix porosity, also regulates stem cell differentiation. By modulating substrate porosity without altering stiffness in polyacrylamide gels, we show that varying substrate porosity did not significantly change protein tethering, substrate deformations, or the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stromal cells and marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells. Varying protein–substrate linker density up to 50-fold changed tethering, but did not affect osteogenesis, adipogenesis, surface–protein unfolding or underlying substrate deformations. Differentiation was also unaffected by the absence of protein tethering. Our findings imply that the stiffness of planar matrices regulates stem cell differentiation independently of protein tethering and porosity."
878,Electric control of the spin Hall effect by intervalley transitions,2014-08-10,"Controlling spin-related material properties by electronic means is a key step towards future spintronic technologies. The spin Hall effect (SHE) has become increasingly important for generating, detecting and using spin currents, but its strength—quantified in terms of the SHE angle—is ultimately fixed by the magnitude of the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) present for any given material system. However, if the electrons generating the SHE can be controlled by populating different areas (valleys) of the electronic structure with different SOC characteristic the SHE angle can be tuned directly within a single sample. Here we report the manipulation of the SHE in bulk GaAs at room temperature by means of an electrical intervalley transition induced in the conduction band. The spin Hall angle was determined by measuring an electromotive force driven by photoexcited spin-polarized electrons drifting through GaAs Hall bars. By controlling electron populations in different (Γ and L) valleys, we manipulated the angle from 0.0005 to 0.02. This change by a factor of 40 is unprecedented in GaAs and the highest value achieved is comparable to that of the heavy metal Pt."
879,Stable lithium electrodeposition in liquid and nanoporous solid electrolytes,2014-08-10,"Rechargeable lithium, sodium and aluminium metal-based batteries are among the most versatile platforms for high-energy, cost-effective electrochemical energy storage. Non-uniform metal deposition and dendrite formation on the negative electrode during repeated cycles of charge and discharge are major hurdles to commercialization of energy-storage devices based on each of these chemistries. A long-held view is that unstable electrodeposition is a consequence of inherent characteristics of these metals and their inability to form uniform electrodeposits on surfaces with inevitable defects. We report on electrodeposition of lithium in simple liquid electrolytes and in nanoporous solids infused with liquid electrolytes. We find that simple liquid electrolytes reinforced with halogenated salt blends exhibit stable long-term cycling at room temperature, often with no signs of deposition instabilities over hundreds of cycles of charge and discharge and thousands of operating hours. We rationalize these observations with the help of surface energy data for the electrolyte/lithium interface and impedance analysis of the interface during different stages of cell operation. Our findings provide support for an important recent theoretical prediction that the surface mobility of lithium is significantly enhanced in the presence of lithium halide salts. Our results also show that a high electrolyte modulus is unnecessary for stable electrodeposition of lithium."
880,Dynamic layer rearrangement during growth of layered oxide films by molecular beam epitaxy,2014-08-03,"The An+1BnO3n+1 Ruddlesden–Popper homologous series offers a wide variety of functionalities including dielectric, ferroelectric, magnetic and catalytic properties. Unfortunately, the synthesis of such layered oxides has been a major challenge owing to the occurrence of growth defects that result in poor materials behaviour in the higher-order members. To understand the fundamental physics of layered oxide growth, we have developed an oxide molecular beam epitaxy system with in situ synchrotron X-ray scattering capability. We present results demonstrating that layered oxide films can dynamically rearrange during growth, leading to structures that are highly unexpected on the basis of the intended layer sequencing. Theoretical calculations indicate that rearrangement can occur in many layered oxide systems and suggest a general approach that may be essential for the construction of metastable Ruddlesden–Popper phases. We demonstrate the utility of the new-found growth strategy by performing the first atomically controlled synthesis of single-crystalline La3Ni2O7."
881,Enhanced lubrication on tissue and biomaterial surfaces through peptide-mediated binding of hyaluronic acid,2014-08-03,"Lubrication is key for the efficient function of devices and tissues with moving surfaces, such as articulating joints, ocular surfaces and the lungs. Indeed, lubrication dysfunction leads to increased friction and degeneration of these systems. Here, we present a polymer–peptide surface coating platform to non-covalently bind hyaluronic acid (HA), a natural lubricant in the body. Tissue surfaces treated with the HA-binding system exhibited higher lubricity values, and in vivo were able to retain HA in the articular joint and to bind ocular tissue surfaces. Biomaterials-mediated strategies that locally bind and concentrate HA could provide physical and biological benefits when used to treat tissue-lubricating dysfunction and to coat medical devices."
882,Separation of rare gases and chiral molecules by selective binding in porous organic cages,2014-07-20,"The separation of molecules with similar size and shape is an important technological challenge. For example, rare gases can pose either an economic opportunity or an environmental hazard and there is a need to separate these spherical molecules selectively at low concentrations in air. Likewise, chiral molecules are important building blocks for pharmaceuticals, but chiral enantiomers, by definition, have identical size and shape, and their separation can be challenging. Here we show that a porous organic cage molecule has unprecedented performance in the solid state for the separation of rare gases, such as krypton and xenon. The selectivity arises from a precise size match between the rare gas and the organic cage cavity, as predicted by molecular simulations. Breakthrough experiments demonstrate real practical potential for the separation of krypton, xenon and radon from air at concentrations of only a few parts per million. We also demonstrate selective binding of chiral organic molecules such as 1-phenylethanol, suggesting applications in enantioselective separation."
883,Visualization of oscillatory behaviour of Pt nanoparticles catalysing CO oxidation,2014-07-20,"Many catalytic reactions under fixed conditions exhibit oscillatory behaviour. The oscillations are often attributed to dynamic changes in the catalyst surface. So far, however, such relationships were difficult to determine for catalysts consisting of supported nanoparticles. Here, we employ a nanoreactor to study the oscillatory CO oxidation catalysed by Pt nanoparticles using time-resolved high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and calorimetry. The observations reveal that periodic changes in the CO oxidation are synchronous with a periodic refacetting of the Pt nanoparticles. The oscillatory reaction is modelled using density functional theory and mass transport calculations, considering the CO adsorption energy and the oxidation rate as site-dependent. We find that to successfully explain the oscillations, the model must contain the phenomenon of refacetting. The nanoreactor approach can thus provide atomic-scale information that is specific to surface sites. This will improve the understanding of dynamic properties in catalysis and related fields."
884,Solvent engineering for high-performance inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite solar cells,2014-07-06,"Organolead trihalide perovskite materials have been successfully used as light absorbers in efficient photovoltaic cells. Two different cell structures, based on mesoscopic metal oxides and planar heterojunctions have already demonstrated very impressive advances in performance. Here, we report a bilayer architecture comprising the key features of mesoscopic and planar structures obtained by a fully solution-based process. We used CH3NH3 Pb(I1 − xBrx)3 (x = 0.1–0.15) as the absorbing layer and poly(triarylamine) as a hole-transporting material. The use of a mixed solvent of γ-butyrolactone and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) followed by toluene drop-casting leads to extremely uniform and dense perovskite layers via a CH3NH3I–PbI2–DMSO intermediate phase, and enables the fabrication of remarkably improved solar cells with a certified power-conversion efficiency of 16.2% and no hysteresis. These results provide important progress towards the understanding of the role of solution-processing in the realization of low-cost and highly efficient perovskite solar cells."
885,Narrow-band red-emitting Sr[LiAl,2014-06-22,"To facilitate the next generation of high-power white-light-emitting diodes (white LEDs), the discovery of more efficient red-emitting phosphor materials is essential. In this regard, the hardly explored compound class of nitridoaluminates affords a new material with superior luminescence properties. Doped with Eu2+, Sr[LiAl3N4] emerged as a new high-performance narrow-band red-emitting phosphor material, which can efficiently be excited by GaN-based blue LEDs. Owing to the highly efficient red emission at λmax ~ 650 nm with a full-width at half-maximum of ~1,180 cm−1 (~50 nm) that shows only very low thermal quenching (>95% relative to the quantum efficiency at 200 °C), a prototype phosphor-converted LED (pc-LED), employing Sr[LiAl3N4]:Eu2+ as the red-emitting component, already shows an increase of 14% in luminous efficacy compared with a commercially available high colour rendering index (CRI) LED, together with an excellent colour rendition (Ra8 = 91, R9 = 57). Therefore, we predict great potential for industrial applications in high-power white pc-LEDs."
886,Gradated assembly of multiple proteins into supramolecular nanomaterials,2014-06-15,"Biomaterials exhibiting precise ratios of different bioactive protein components are critical for applications ranging from vaccines to regenerative medicine, but their design is often hindered by limited choices and cross-reactivity of protein conjugation chemistries. Here, we describe a strategy for inducing multiple different expressed proteins of choice to assemble into nanofibres and gels with exceptional compositional control. The strategy employs ‘βTail’ tags, which allow for good protein expression in bacteriological cultures, yet can be induced to co-assemble into nanomaterials when mixed with additional β-sheet fibrillizing peptides. Multiple different βTail fusion proteins could be inserted into peptide nanofibres alone or in combination at predictable, smoothly gradated concentrations, providing a simple yet versatile route to install precise combinations of proteins into nanomaterials. The technology is illustrated by achieving precisely targeted hues using mixtures of fluorescent proteins, by creating nanofibres bearing enzymatic activity, and by adjusting antigenic dominance in vaccines."
887,Extracellular matrix stiffness and composition jointly regulate the induction of malignant phenotypes in mammary epithelium,2014-06-15,"In vitro models of normal mammary epithelium have correlated increased extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness with malignant phenotypes. However, the role of increased stiffness in this transformation remains unclear because of difficulties in controlling ECM stiffness, composition and architecture independently. Here we demonstrate that interpenetrating networks of reconstituted basement membrane matrix and alginate can be used to modulate ECM stiffness independently of composition and architecture. We find that, in normal mammary epithelial cells, increasing ECM stiffness alone induces malignant phenotypes but that the effect is completely abrogated when accompanied by an increase in basement-membrane ligands. We also find that the combination of stiffness and composition is sensed through β4 integrin, Rac1, and the PI3K pathway, and suggest a mechanism in which an increase in ECM stiffness, without an increase in basement membrane ligands, prevents normal α6β4 integrin clustering into hemidesmosomes."
888, micropillar compression reveals superior strength and ductility but an absence of damage in lamellar bone,2014-06-08,"Ageing societies suffer from an increasing incidence of bone fractures. Bone strength depends on the amount of mineral measured by clinical densitometry, but also on the micromechanical properties of the hierarchical organization of bone. Here, we investigate the mechanical response under monotonic and cyclic compression of both single osteonal lamellae and macroscopic samples containing numerous osteons. Micropillar compression tests in a scanning electron microscope, microindentation and macroscopic compression tests were performed on dry ovine bone to identify the elastic modulus, yield stress, plastic deformation, damage accumulation and failure mechanisms. We found that isolated lamellae exhibit a plastic behaviour, with higher yield stress and ductility but no damage. In agreement with a proposed rheological model, these experiments illustrate a transition from a ductile mechanical behaviour of bone at the microscale to a quasi-brittle response driven by the growth of cracks along interfaces or in the vicinity of pores at the macroscale."
889,Air-stable n-type colloidal quantum dot solids,2014-06-08,"Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) offer promise in flexible electronics, light sensing and energy conversion. These applications rely on rectifying junctions that require the creation of high-quality CQD solids that are controllably n-type (electron-rich) or p-type (hole-rich). Unfortunately, n-type semiconductors made using soft matter are notoriously prone to oxidation within minutes of air exposure. Here we report high-performance, air-stable n-type CQD solids. Using density functional theory we identify inorganic passivants that bind strongly to the CQD surface and repel oxidative attack. A materials processing strategy that wards off strong protic attack by polar solvents enabled the synthesis of an air-stable n-type PbS CQD solid. This material was used to build an air-processed inverted quantum junction device, which shows the highest current density from any CQD solar cell and a solar power conversion efficiency as high as 8%. We also feature the n-type CQD solid in the rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of atmospheric NO2. This work paves the way for new families of electronic devices that leverage air-stable quantum-tuned materials."
890,Etchable plasmonic nanoparticle probes to image and quantify cellular internalization,2014-06-08,"There is considerable interest in using nanoparticles as labels or to deliver drugs and other bioactive compounds to cells in vitro and in vivo. Fluorescent imaging, commonly used to study internalization and subcellular localization of nanoparticles, does not allow unequivocal distinction between cell surface-bound and internalized particles, as there is no methodology to turn particles ‘off’. We have developed a simple technique to rapidly remove silver nanoparticles outside living cells, leaving only the internalized pool for imaging or quantification. The silver nanoparticle (AgNP) etching is based on the sensitivity of Ag to a hexacyanoferrate–thiosulphate redox-based destain solution. In demonstration of the technique we present a class of multicoloured plasmonic nanoprobes comprising dye-labelled AgNPs that are exceptionally bright and photostable, carry peptides as model targeting ligands, can be etched rapidly and with minimal toxicity in mice, and that show tumour uptake in vivo."
891,Acoustic metasurface with hybrid resonances,2014-06-01,"An impedance-matched surface has the property that an incident wave generates no reflection. Here we demonstrate that by using a simple construction, an acoustically reflecting surface can acquire hybrid resonances and becomes impedance-matched to airborne sound at tunable frequencies, such that no reflection is generated. Each resonant cell of the metasurface is deep-subwavelength in all its spatial dimensions, with its thickness less than the peak absorption wavelength by two orders of magnitude. As there can be no transmission, the impedance-matched acoustic wave is hence either completely absorbed at one or multiple frequencies, or converted into other form(s) of energy, such as an electrical current. A high acoustic–electrical energy conversion efficiency of 23% is achieved."
892,Anion charge storage through oxygen intercalation in LaMnO,2014-06-01,"Perovskite oxides have attracted significant attention as energy conversion materials for metal–air battery and solid-oxide fuel-cell electrodes owing to their unique physical and electronic properties. Amongst these unique properties is the structural stability of the cation array in perovskites that can accommodate mobile oxygen ions under electrical polarization. Despite oxygen ion mobility and vacancies having been shown to play an important role in catalysis, their role in charge storage has yet to be explored. Herein we investigate the mechanism of oxygen-vacancy-mediated redox pseudocapacitance for a nanostructured lanthanum-based perovskite, LaMnO3. This is the first example of anion-based intercalation pseudocapacitance as well as the first time oxygen intercalation has been exploited for fast energy storage. Whereas previous pseudocapacitor and rechargeable battery charge storage studies have focused on cation intercalation, the anion-based mechanism presented here offers a new paradigm for electrochemical energy storage."
893,Engineering of light confinement in strongly scattering disordered media,2014-05-18,"Disordered photonic materials can diffuse and localize light through random multiple scattering, offering opportunities to study mesoscopic phenomena, control light–matter interactions, and provide new strategies for photonic applications. Light transport in such media is governed by photonic modes characterized by resonances with finite spectral width and spatial extent. Considerable steps have been made recently towards control over the transport using wavefront shaping techniques. The selective engineering of individual modes, however, has been addressed only theoretically. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the possibility to engineer the confinement and the mutual interaction of modes in a two-dimensional disordered photonic structure. The strong light confinement is achieved at the fabrication stage by an optimization of the structure, and an accurate and local tuning of the mode resonance frequencies is achieved via post-fabrication processes. To show the versatility of our technique, we selectively control the detuning between overlapping localized modes and observe both frequency crossing and anti-crossing behaviours, thereby paving the way for the creation of open transmission channels in strongly scattering media."
894,New metastable form of ice and its role in the homogeneous crystallization of water,2014-05-18,"The homogeneous crystallization of water at low temperature is believed to occur through the direct nucleation of cubic (Ic) and hexagonal (Ih) ices. Here, we provide evidence from molecular simulations that the nucleation of ice proceeds through the formation of a new metastable phase, which we name Ice 0. We find that Ice 0 is structurally similar to the supercooled liquid, and that on growth it gradually converts into a stacking of Ice Ic and Ih. We suggest that this mechanism provides a thermodynamic explanation for the location and pressure dependence of the homogeneous nucleation temperature, and that Ice 0 controls the homogeneous nucleation of low-pressure ices, acting as a precursor to crystallization in accordance with Ostwald’s step rule of phases. Our findings show that metastable crystalline phases of water may play roles that have been largely overlooked."
895,Optically enhanced coherent transport in YBa,2014-05-11,"Nonlinear optical excitation of infrared active lattice vibrations has been shown to melt magnetic or orbital orders and to transform insulators into metals. In cuprates, this technique has been used to remove charge stripes and promote superconductivity, acting in a way opposite to static magnetic fields. Here, we show that excitation of large-amplitude apical oxygen distortions in the cuprate superconductor YBa2Cu3O6.5 promotes highly unconventional electronic properties. Below the superconducting transition temperature (Tc = 50 K) inter-bilayer coherence is transiently enhanced at the expense of intra-bilayer coupling. Strikingly, even above Tc a qualitatively similar effect is observed up to room temperature, with transient inter-bilayer coherence emerging from the incoherent ground state and similar transfer of spectral weight from high to low frequency. These observations are compatible with previous reports of an inhomogeneous normal state that retains important properties of a superconductor, in which light may be melting competing orders or dynamically synchronizing the interlayer phase. The transient redistribution of coherence discussed here could lead to new strategies to enhance superconductivity in steady state."
896,Proton switch for modulating oxygen reduction by a copper electrocatalyst embedded in a hybrid bilayer membrane,2014-05-11,"Molecular switches gate many fundamental processes in natural and artificial systems. Here, we report the development of an electrochemical platform in which a proton carrier switches the activity of a catalyst. By incorporating an alkyl phosphate in the lipid layer of a hybrid bilayer membrane, we regulate proton transport to a Cu-based molecular oxygen reduction reaction catalyst. To construct this hybrid bilayer membrane system, we prepare an example of a synthetic Cu oxygen reduction reaction catalyst that forms a self-assembled monolayer on Au surfaces. We then embed this Cu catalyst inside a hybrid bilayer membrane by depositing a monolayer of lipid on the self-assembled monolayer. We envisage that this electrochemical system can give a unique mechanistic insight not only into the oxygen reduction reaction, but into proton-coupled electron transfer in general."
897,Bacteria-instructed synthesis of polymers for self-selective microbial binding and labelling,2014-05-11,"The detection and inactivation of pathogenic strains of bacteria continues to be an important therapeutic goal. Hence, there is a need for materials that can bind selectively to specific microorganisms for diagnostic or anti-infective applications, but that can be formed from simple and inexpensive building blocks. Here, we exploit bacterial redox systems to induce a copper-mediated radical polymerization of synthetic monomers at cell surfaces, generating polymers in situ that bind strongly to the microorganisms that produced them. This ‘bacteria-instructed synthesis’ can be carried out with a variety of microbial strains, and we show that the polymers produced are self-selective binding agents for the ‘instructing’ cell types. We further expand on the bacterial redox chemistries to ‘click’ fluorescent reporters onto polymers directly at the surfaces of a range of clinical isolate strains, allowing rapid, facile and simultaneous binding and visualization of pathogens."
898,Polariton-mediated energy transfer between organic dyes in a strongly coupled optical microcavity,2014-05-04,"Strongly coupled optical microcavities containing different exciton states permit the creation of hybrid-polariton modes that can be described in terms of a linear admixture of cavity-photon and the constituent excitons. Such hybrid states have been predicted to have optical properties that are different from their constituent parts, making them a test bed for the exploration of light–matter coupling. Here, we use strong coupling in an optical microcavity to mix the electronic transitions of two J-aggregated molecular dyes and use both non-resonant photoluminescence emission and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy to show that hybrid-polariton states act as an efficient and ultrafast energy-transfer pathway between the two exciton states. We argue that this type of structure may act as a model system to study energy-transfer processes in biological light-harvesting complexes."
899,Rigidity sensing and adaptation through regulation of integrin types,2014-05-04,"Tissue rigidity regulates processes in development, cancer and wound healing. However, how cells detect rigidity, and thereby modulate their behaviour, remains unknown. Here, we show that sensing and adaptation to matrix rigidity in breast myoepithelial cells is determined by the bond dynamics of different integrin types. Cell binding to fibronectin through either α5β1 integrins (constitutively expressed) or αvβ6 integrins (selectively expressed in cancer and development) adapts force generation, actin flow and integrin recruitment to rigidities associated with healthy or malignant tissue, respectively. In vitro experiments and theoretical modelling further demonstrate that this behaviour is explained by the different binding and unbinding rates of both integrin types to fibronectin. Moreover, rigidity sensing through differences in integrin bond dynamics applies both when integrins bind separately and when they compete for binding to fibronectin."
900,Magnetization switching through giant spin–orbit torque in a magnetically doped topological insulator heterostructure,2014-04-28,"Recent demonstrations of magnetization switching induced by in-plane current in heavy metal/ferromagnetic heterostructures (HMFHs) have drawn great attention to spin torques arising from large spin–orbit coupling (SOC). Given the intrinsic strong SOC, topological insulators (TIs) are expected to be promising candidates for exploring spin–orbit torque (SOT)-related physics. Here we demonstrate experimentally the magnetization switching through giant SOT induced by an in-plane current in a chromium-doped TI bilayer heterostructure. The critical current density required for switching is below 8.9 × 104 A cm−2 at 1.9 K. Moreover, the SOT is calibrated by measuring the effective spin–orbit field using second-harmonic methods. The effective field to current ratio and the spin-Hall angle tangent are almost three orders of magnitude larger than those reported for HMFHs. The giant SOT and efficient current-induced magnetization switching exhibited by the bilayer heterostructure may lead to innovative spintronics applications such as ultralow power dissipation memory and logic devices."
901,Scalable production of large quantities of defect-free few-layer graphene by shear exfoliation in liquids,2014-04-20,"To progress from the laboratory to commercial applications, it will be necessary to develop industrially scalable methods to produce large quantities of defect-free graphene. Here we show that high-shear mixing of graphite in suitable stabilizing liquids results in large-scale exfoliation to give dispersions of graphene nanosheets. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy show the exfoliated flakes to be unoxidized and free of basal-plane defects. We have developed a simple model that shows exfoliation to occur once the local shear rate exceeds 104 s−1. By fully characterizing the scaling behaviour of the graphene production rate, we show that exfoliation can be achieved in liquid volumes from hundreds of millilitres up to hundreds of litres and beyond. The graphene produced by this method performs well in applications from composites to conductive coatings. This method can be applied to exfoliate BN, MoS2 and a range of other layered crystals."
902,Auxetic nuclei in embryonic stem cells exiting pluripotency,2014-04-20,"Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) self-renew in a state of naïve pluripotency in which they are competent to generate all somatic cells. It has been hypothesized that, before irreversibly committing, ESCs pass through at least one metastable transition state. This transition would represent a gateway for differentiation and reprogramming of somatic cells. Here, we show that during the transition, the nuclei of ESCs are auxetic: they exhibit a cross-sectional expansion when stretched and a cross-sectional contraction when compressed, and their stiffness increases under compression. We also show that the auxetic phenotype of transition ESC nuclei is driven at least in part by global chromatin decondensation. Through the regulation of molecular turnover in the differentiating nucleus by external forces, auxeticity could be a key element in mechanotransduction. Our findings highlight the importance of nuclear structure in the regulation of differentiation and reprogramming."
903,Vacancy defects and monopole dynamics in oxygen-deficient pyrochlores,2014-04-13,"The idea of magnetic monopoles in spin ice has enjoyed much success at intermediate temperatures, but at low temperatures a description in terms of monopole dynamics alone is insufficient. Recently, numerical simulations were used to argue that magnetic impurities account for this discrepancy by introducing a magnetic equivalent of residual resistance in the system. Here we propose that oxygen deficiency is the leading cause of magnetic impurities in as-grown samples, and we determine the defect structure and magnetism in Y2Ti2O7−δ using diffuse neutron scattering and magnetization measurements. These defects are eliminated by oxygen annealing. The introduction of oxygen vacancies causes Ti4+ to transform to magnetic Ti3+ with quenched orbital magnetism, but the concentration is anomalously low. In the spin-ice material Dy2Ti2O7 we find that the same oxygen-vacancy defects suppress moments on neighbouring rare-earth sites, and that these magnetic distortions markedly slow down the long-time monopole dynamics at sub-Kelvin temperatures."
904,Combinatorial development of bulk metallic glasses,2014-04-13,"The identification of multicomponent alloys out of a vast compositional space is a daunting task, especially for bulk metallic glasses composed of three or more elements. Despite an increasing theoretical understanding of glass formation, bulk metallic glasses are predominantly developed through a sequential and time-consuming trial-and-error approach. Even for binary systems, accurate quantum mechanical approaches are still many orders of magnitude away from being able to simulate the relatively slow kinetics of glass formation. Here, we present a high-throughput strategy where ∼3,000 alloy compositions are fabricated simultaneously and characterized for thermoplastic formability through parallel blow forming. Using this approach, we identified the composition with the highest thermoplastic formability in the glass-forming system Mg–Cu–Y. The method provides a versatile toolbox for unveiling complex correlations of material properties and glass formation, and should facilitate a drastic increase in the discovery rate of metallic glasses."
905,Universal process-inert encoding architecture for polymer microparticles,2014-04-13,"Polymer microparticles with unique, decodable identities are versatile information carriers with a small footprint. Widespread incorporation into industrial processes, however, is limited by a trade-off between encoding density, scalability and decoding robustness in diverse physicochemical environments. Here, we report an encoding strategy that combines spatial patterning with rare-earth upconversion nanocrystals, single-wavelength near-infrared excitation and portable CCD (charge-coupled device)-based decoding to distinguish particles synthesized by means of flow lithography. This architecture exhibits large, exponentially scalable encoding capacities (>106 particles), an ultralow decoding false-alarm rate (<10−9), the ability to manipulate particles by applying magnetic fields, and pronounced insensitivity to both particle chemistry and harsh processing conditions. We demonstrate quantitative agreement between observed and predicted decoding for a range of practical applications with orthogonal requirements, including covert multiparticle barcoding of pharmaceutical packaging (refractive-index matching), multiplexed microRNA detection (biocompatibility) and embedded labelling of high-temperature-cast objects (temperature resistance)."
906,Spatially resolving valley quantum interference of a donor in silicon,2014-04-06,"Electron and nuclear spins of donor ensembles in isotopically pure silicon experience a vacuum-like environment, giving them extraordinary coherence. However, in contrast to a real vacuum, electrons in silicon occupy quantum superpositions of valleys in momentum space. Addressable single-qubit and two-qubit operations in silicon require that qubits are placed near interfaces, modifying the valley degrees of freedom associated with these quantum superpositions and strongly influencing qubit relaxation and exchange processes. Yet to date, spectroscopic measurements have only probed wavefunctions indirectly, preventing direct experimental access to valley population, donor position and environment. Here we directly probe the probability density of single quantum states of individual subsurface donors, in real space and reciprocal space, using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. We directly observe quantum mechanical valley interference patterns associated with linear superpositions of valleys in the donor ground state. The valley population is found to be within 5% of a bulk donor when 2.85 ± 0.45 nm from the interface, indicating that valley-perturbation-induced enhancement of spin relaxation will be negligible for depths greater than 3 nm. The observed valley interference will render two-qubit exchange gates sensitive to atomic-scale variations in positions of subsurface donors. Moreover, these results will also be of interest for emerging schemes proposing to encode information directly in valley polarization."
907,Observation of quadrupole helix chirality and its domain structure in DyFe,2014-04-06,"Resonant X-ray diffraction (RXD) uses X-rays in the vicinity of a specific atomic absorption edge and is a powerful technique for studying symmetry breaking by motifs of various multipole moments, such as electric monopoles (charge), magnetic dipoles (spin) and electric quadrupoles (orbital). Using circularly polarized X-rays, this technique has been developed to verify symmetry breaking effects arising from chirality, the asymmetry of an object upon its mirroring. Chirality plays a crucial role in the emergence of functionalities such as optical rotatory power and multiferroicity. Here we apply spatially resolved RXD to reveal the helix chirality of Dy 4f electric quadrupole orientations and its domain structure in DyFe3(BO3)4, which shows a reversible phase transition into an enantiomorphic space-group pair. The present study provides evidence for a helix chiral motif of quadrupole moments developed in crystallographic helix chirality."
908,Pervasive nanoscale deformation twinning as a catalyst for efficient energy dissipation in a bioceramic armour,2014-03-30,"Hierarchical composite materials design in biological exoskeletons achieves penetration resistance through a variety of energy-dissipating mechanisms while simultaneously balancing the need for damage localization to avoid compromising the mechanical integrity of the entire structure and to maintain multi-hit capability. Here, we show that the shell of the bivalve Placuna placenta (~99 wt% calcite), which possesses the unique optical property of ~80% total transmission of visible light, simultaneously achieves penetration resistance and deformation localization via increasing energy dissipation density (0.290 ± 0.072 nJ μm−3) by approximately an order of magnitude relative to single-crystal geological calcite (0.034 ± 0.013 nJ μm−3). P. placenta, which is composed of a layered assembly of elongated diamond-shaped calcite crystals, undergoes pervasive nanoscale deformation twinning (width ~50 nm) surrounding the penetration zone, which catalyses a series of additional inelastic energy dissipating mechanisms such as interfacial and intracrystalline nanocracking, viscoplastic stretching of interfacial organic material, and nanograin formation and reorientation."
909,Injectable and bioresponsive hydrogels for on-demand matrix metalloproteinase inhibition,2014-03-30,"Inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been extensively explored to treat pathologies where excessive MMP activity contributes to adverse tissue remodelling. Although MMP inhibition remains a relevant therapeutic target, MMP inhibitors have not translated to clinical application owing to the dose-limiting side effects following systemic administration of the drugs. Here, we describe the synthesis of a polysaccharide-based hydrogel that can be locally injected into tissues and releases a recombinant tissue inhibitor of MMPs (rTIMP-3) in response to MMP activity. Specifically, rTIMP-3 is sequestered in the hydrogels through electrostatic interactions and is released as crosslinks are degraded by active MMPs. Targeted delivery of the hydrogel/rTIMP-3 construct to regions of MMP overexpression following a myocardial infarction significantly reduced MMP activity and attenuated adverse left ventricular remodelling in a porcine model of myocardial infarction. Our findings demonstrate that local, on-demand MMP inhibition is achievable through the use of an injectable and bioresponsive hydrogel."
910,Persistent optically induced magnetism in oxygen-deficient strontium titanate,2014-03-23,"Strontium titanate (SrTiO3) is a foundational material in the emerging field of complex oxide electronics. Although its bulk electronic and optical properties are rich and have been studied for decades, SrTiO3 has recently become a renewed focus of materials research catalysed in part by the discovery of superconductivity and magnetism at interfaces between SrTiO3 and other non-magnetic oxides. Here we illustrate a new aspect to the phenomenology of magnetism in SrTiO3 by reporting the observation of an optically induced and persistent magnetization in slightly oxygen-deficient bulk SrTiO3−δ crystals using magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry. This zero-field magnetization appears below ~18 K, persists for hours below 10 K, and is tunable by means of the polarization and wavelength of sub-bandgap (400–500 nm) light. These effects occur only in crystals containing oxygen vacancies, revealing a detailed interplay between magnetism, lattice defects, and light in an archetypal complex oxide material."
911,"Strong, tough and stiff bioinspired ceramics from brittle constituents",2014-03-23," High strength and high toughness are usually mutually exclusive in engineering materials. In ceramics, improving toughness usually relies on the introduction of a metallic or polymeric ductile phase, but this decreases the material’s strength and stiffness as well as its high-temperature stability. Although natural materials that are both strong and tough rely on a combination of mechanisms operating at different length scales, the relevant structures have been extremely difficult to replicate. Here, we report a bioinspired approach based on widespread ceramic processing techniques for the fabrication of bulk ceramics without a ductile phase and with a unique combination of high strength (470 MPa), high toughness (17.3 MPa m1/2), and high stiffness (290 GPa). Because only mineral constituents are needed, these ceramics retain their mechanical properties at high temperatures (600 °C). Our bioinspired, material-independent approach should find uses in the design and processing of materials for structural, transportation and energy-related applications."
912,Synthesis and patterning of tunable multiscale materials with engineered cells,2014-03-23,"Many natural biological systems—such as biofilms, shells and skeletal tissues—are able to assemble multifunctional and environmentally responsive multiscale assemblies of living and non-living components. Here, by using inducible genetic circuits and cellular communication circuits to regulate Escherichia coli curli amyloid production, we show that E. coli cells can organize self-assembling amyloid fibrils across multiple length scales, producing amyloid-based materials that are either externally controllable or undergo autonomous patterning. We also interfaced curli fibrils with inorganic materials, such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and quantum dots (QDs), and used these capabilities to create an environmentally responsive biofilm-based electrical switch, produce gold nanowires and nanorods, co-localize AuNPs with CdTe/CdS QDs to modulate QD fluorescence lifetimes, and nucleate the formation of fluorescent ZnS QDs. This work lays a foundation for synthesizing, patterning, and controlling functional composite materials with engineered cells."
913,Quantum criticality in a metallic spin liquid,2014-03-21,"When magnetic order is suppressed by frustrated interactions, spins form a highly correlated fluctuating ‘spin liquid’ state down to low temperatures. The magnetic order of local moments can also be suppressed when they are fully screened by conduction electrons through the Kondo effect. Thus, the combination of strong geometrical frustration and Kondo screening may lead to novel types of quantum phase transition. We report low-temperature thermodynamic measurements on the frustrated Kondo lattice Pr2Ir2O7, which exhibits a chiral spin liquid state below 1.5 K as a result of the frustrated interaction between Ising 4f local moments and their interplay with Ir conduction electrons. Our results provide a first clear example of zero-field quantum critical scaling that emerges in a spin liquid state of a highly frustrated metal."
914,Organo-erbium systems for optical amplification at telecommunications wavelengths,2014-03-21,"Modern telecommunications rely on the transmission and manipulation of optical signals. Optical amplification plays a vital part in this technology, as all components in a real telecommunications system produce some loss. The two main issues with present amplifiers, which rely on erbium ions in a glass matrix, are the difficulty in integration onto a single substrate and the need of high pump power densities to produce gain. Here we show a potential organic optical amplifier material that demonstrates population inversion when pumped from above using low-power visible light. This system is integrated into an organic light-emitting diode demonstrating that electrical pumping can be achieved. This opens the possibility of direct electrically driven optical amplifiers and optical circuits. Our results provide an alternative approach to producing low-cost integrated optics that is compatible with existing silicon photonics and a different route to an effective integrated optics technology."
915,The ,2014-03-21,"Optical imaging for biological applications requires more sensitive tools. Near-infrared persistent luminescence nanoparticles enable highly sensitive in vivo optical detection and complete avoidance of tissue autofluorescence. However, the actual generation of persistent luminescence nanoparticles necessitates ex vivo activation before systemic administration, which prevents long-term imaging in living animals. Here, we introduce a new generation of optical nanoprobes, based on chromium-doped zinc gallate, whose persistent luminescence can be activated in vivo through living tissues using highly penetrating low-energy red photons. Surface functionalization of this photonic probe can be adjusted to favour multiple biomedical applications such as tumour targeting. Notably, we show that cells can endocytose these nanoparticles in vitro and that, after intravenous injection, we can track labelled cells in vivo and follow their biodistribution by a simple whole animal optical detection, opening new perspectives for cell therapy research and for a variety of diagnosis applications."
916,Accelerating charging dynamics in subnanometre pores,2014-03-21,"Supercapacitors have exceptional power density and cyclability but smaller energy density than batteries. Their energy density can be increased using ionic liquids and electrodes with subnanometre pores, but this tends to reduce their power density and compromise the key advantage of supercapacitors. To help address this issue through material optimization, here we unravel the mechanisms of charging subnanometre pores with ionic liquids using molecular dynamics simulations, navigated by a phenomenological model. We show that charging of ionophilic pores is a diffusive process, often accompanied by overfilling followed by de-filling. In sharp contrast to conventional expectations, charging is fast because ion diffusion during charging can be an order of magnitude faster than in the bulk, and charging itself is accelerated by the onset of collective modes. Further acceleration can be achieved using ionophobic pores by eliminating overfilling/de-filling and thus leading to charging behaviour qualitatively different from that in conventional, ionophilic pores."
917,Mechanical memory and dosing influence stem cell fate,2014-03-16,"We investigated whether stem cells remember past physical signals and whether these can be exploited to dose cells mechanically. We found that the activation of the Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding domain (TAZ) as well as the pre-osteogenic transcription factor RUNX2 in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) cultured on soft poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels (Young’s modulus E ~ 2 kPa) depended on previous culture time on stiff tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS; E ~ 3 GPa). In addition, mechanical dosing of hMSCs cultured on initially stiff (E ~ 10 kPa) and then soft (E ~ 2 kPa) phototunable PEG hydrogels resulted in either reversible or—above a threshold mechanical dose—irreversible activation of YAP/TAZ and RUNX2. We also found that increased mechanical dosing on supraphysiologically stiff TCPS biases hMSCs towards osteogenic differentiation. We conclude that stem cells possess mechanical memory—with YAP/TAZ acting as an intracellular mechanical rheostat—that stores information from past physical environments and influences the cells’ fate."
918,Plant nanobionics approach to augment photosynthesis and biochemical sensing,2014-03-16,"The interface between plant organelles and non-biological nanostructures has the potential to impart organelles with new and enhanced functions. Here, we show that single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) passively transport and irreversibly localize within the lipid envelope of extracted plant chloroplasts, promote over three times higher photosynthetic activity than that of controls, and enhance maximum electron transport rates. The SWNT–chloroplast assemblies also enable higher rates of leaf electron transport in vivo through a mechanism consistent with augmented photoabsorption. Concentrations of reactive oxygen species inside extracted chloroplasts are significantly suppressed by delivering poly(acrylic acid)–nanoceria or SWNT–nanoceria complexes. Moreover, we show that SWNTs enable near-infrared fluorescence monitoring of nitric oxide both ex vivo and in vivo, thus demonstrating that a plant can be augmented to function as a photonic chemical sensor. Nanobionics engineering of plant function may contribute to the development of biomimetic materials for light-harvesting and biochemical detection with regenerative properties and enhanced efficiency."
919,Electro-optical switching of graphene oxide liquid crystals with an extremely large Kerr coefficient,2014-03-09,"The sensitive response of the nematic graphene oxide (GO) phase to external stimuli makes this phase attractive for extending the applicability of GO and reduced GO to solution processes and electro-optic devices. However, contrary to expectations, the alignment of nematic GO has been difficult to control through the application of electric fields or surface treatments. Here, we show that when interflake interactions are sufficiently weak, both the degree of microscopic ordering and the direction of macroscopic alignment of GO liquid crystals (LCs) can be readily controlled by applying low electric fields. We also show that the large polarizability anisotropy of GO and Onsager excluded-volume effect cooperatively give rise to Kerr coefficients that are about three orders of magnitude larger than the maximum value obtained so far in molecular LCs. The extremely large Kerr coefficient allowed us to fabricate electro-optic devices with macroscopic electrodes, as well as well-aligned, defect-free GO over wide areas."
920,Isotropic round-wire multifilament cuprate superconductor for generation of magnetic fields above 30 T,2014-03-09,"Magnets are the principal market for superconductors, but making attractive conductors out of the high-temperature cuprate superconductors (HTSs) has proved difficult because of the presence of high-angle grain boundaries that are generally believed to lower the critical current density, Jc. To minimize such grain boundary obstacles, HTS conductors such as REBa2Cu3O7−x and (Bi, Pb)2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10−x are both made as tapes with a high aspect ratio and a large superconducting anisotropy. Here we report that Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8−x (Bi-2212) can be made in the much more desirable isotropic, round-wire, multifilament form that can be wound or cabled into arbitrary geometries and will be especially valuable for high-field NMR magnets beyond the present 1 GHz proton resonance limit of Nb3Sn technology. An appealing attribute of this Bi-2212 conductor is that, being without macroscopic texture, it contains many high-angle grain boundaries but nevertheless attains a very high Jc of 2,500 A mm−2 at 20 T and 4.2 K. The large potential of the conductor has been demonstrated by building a small coil that generated almost 2.6 T in a 31 T background field. This demonstration that grain boundary limits to high Jc can be practically overcome underlines the value of a renewed focus on grain boundary properties in non-ideal geometries."
921,Galvanotactic control of collective cell migration in epithelial monolayers,2014-03-09,"Many normal and pathological biological processes involve the migration of epithelial cell sheets. This arises from complex emergent behaviour resulting from the interplay between cellular signalling networks and the forces that physically couple the cells. Here, we demonstrate that collective migration of an epithelium can be interactively guided by applying electric fields that bias the underlying signalling networks. We show that complex, spatiotemporal cues are locally interpreted by the epithelium, resulting in rapid, coordinated responses such as a collective U-turn, divergent migration, and unchecked migration against an obstacle. We observed that the degree of external control depends on the size and shape of the cell population, and on the existence of physical coupling between cells. Together, our results offer design and engineering principles for the rational manipulation of the collective behaviour and material properties of a tissue."
922,Couples of colloidal semiconductor nanorods formed by self-limited assembly,2014-02-20,"Colloidal nanocrystal synthesis provides a powerful approach for creating unique nanostructures of relevance for applications. Here, we report that wurtzite ZnSe nanorod couples connected by twinning structures can be synthesized by means of a self-limited assembly process. Unlike for individual nanorods, the band-edge states calculated for the nanorod couples are predominantly confined to the short edges of the structure and this leads to low photoluminescence polarization anisotropy, as confirmed by single-particle fluorescence. Through a cation-exchange approach, the composition of nanorod couples can be readily expanded to additional materials, such as CdSe and PbSe. We anticipate that this family of nanorod-couple structures with distinct compositions and controlled properties will constitute an ideal system for the investigation of electronic coupling effects between individual nanorod components on the nanoscale, with relevance to applications in optics, photocatalysis and optoelectronic devices."
923,Platinum–cobalt bimetallic nanoparticles in hollow carbon nanospheres for hydrogenolysis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural,2014-02-20,"The synthesis of 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a highly attractive route to a renewable fuel. However, achieving high yields in this reaction is a substantial challenge. Here it is described how PtCo bimetallic nanoparticles with diameters of 3.6 ± 0.7 nm can solve this problem. Over PtCo catalysts the conversion of HMF was 100% within 10 min and the yield to DMF reached 98% after 2 h, which substantially exceeds the best results reported in the literature. Moreover, the synthetic method can be generalized to other bimetallic nanoparticles encapsulated in hollow carbon spheres."
924,Movable high-,2014-02-20,"Subwavelength semiconductor nanowires have recently attracted interest for photonic applications because they possess various unique optical properties and offer great potential for miniaturizing devices. However, realizing tight light confinement or efficient coupling with photonic circuits is not straightforward and remains a challenge. Here we show that a high-Q nanocavity can be created by placing a single III–V semiconductor nanowire with a diameter of under 100 nm in a grooved waveguide in a Si photonic crystal, by means of nanoprobe manipulation. We observe very fast spontaneous emission (91 ps) from nanowires accelerated by the strong Purcell enhancement in nanocavities, which proves that very strong light confinement can be achieved. Furthermore, this system enables us to move the nanocavity anywhere along the waveguide. This configuration provides a significant degree of flexibility in integrated photonics and permits the addition and displacement of various functionalities of III–V nanocavity devices in Si photonic circuits."
925,Engineered materials for all-optical helicity-dependent magnetic switching,2014-02-16,"The possibility of manipulating magnetic systems without applied magnetic fields have attracted growing attention over the past fifteen years. The low-power manipulation of the magnetization, preferably at ultrashort timescales, has become a fundamental challenge with implications for future magnetic information memory and storage technologies. Here we explore the optical manipulation of the magnetization in engineered magnetic materials. We demonstrate that all-optical helicity-dependent switching (AO-HDS) can be observed not only in selected rare earth–transition metal (RE–TM) alloy films but also in a much broader variety of materials, including RE–TM alloys, multilayers and heterostructures. We further show that RE-free Co–Ir-based synthetic ferrimagnetic heterostructures designed to mimic the magnetic properties of RE–TM alloys also exhibit AO-HDS. These results challenge present theories of AO-HDS and provide a pathway to engineering materials for future applications based on all-optical control of magnetic order."
926,Guiding intracortical brain tumour cells to an extracortical cytotoxic hydrogel using aligned polymeric nanofibres,2014-02-16,"Glioblastoma multiforme is an aggressive, invasive brain tumour with a poor survival rate. Available treatments are ineffective and some tumours remain inoperable because of their size or location. The tumours are known to invade and migrate along white matter tracts and blood vessels. Here, we exploit this characteristic of glioblastoma multiforme by engineering aligned polycaprolactone (PCL)-based nanofibres for tumour cells to invade and, hence, guide cells away from the primary tumour site to an extracortical location. This extracortial sink is a cyclopamine drug-conjugated, collagen-based hydrogel. When aligned PCL-nanofibre films in a PCL/polyurethane carrier conduit were inserted in the vicinity of an intracortical human U87MG glioblastoma xenograft, a significant number of human glioblastoma cells migrated along the aligned nanofibre films and underwent apoptosis in the extracortical hydrogel. Tumour volume in the brain was significantly lower following insertion of aligned nanofibre implants compared with the application of smooth fibres or no implants."
927,Nonlinear interactions in an organic polariton condensate,2014-02-09," Under the right conditions, cavity polaritons form a macroscopic condensate in the ground state. The fascinating nonlinear behaviour of this condensate is largely dictated by the strength of polariton–polariton interactions. In inorganic semiconductors, these result principally from the Coulomb interaction between Wannier–Mott excitons. Such interactions are considerably weaker for the tightly bound Frenkel excitons characteristic of organic semiconductors and were notably absent in the first reported demonstration of organic polariton lasing. In this work, we demonstrate the realization of an organic polariton condensate, at room temperature, in a microcavity containing a thin film of 2,7-bis[9,9-di(4-methylphenyl)-fluoren-2-yl]-9,9-di(4-methylphenyl)fluorene. On reaching threshold, we observe the spontaneous formation of a linearly polarized condensate, which exhibits a superlinear power dependence, long-range order and a power-dependent blueshift: a clear signature of Frenkel polariton interactions."
928,Voltage tuning of thermal spin current in ferromagnetic tunnel contacts to semiconductors,2014-02-02,"Spin currents are paramount to manipulate the magnetization of ferromagnetic elements in spin-based memory, logic and microwave devices, and to induce spin polarization in non-magnetic materials. A unique approach to create spin currents employs thermal gradients and heat flow. Here we demonstrate that a thermal spin current can be tuned conveniently by a voltage. In magnetic tunnel contacts to semiconductors (silicon and germanium), it is shown that a modest voltage (~200 mV) changes the thermal spin current induced by Seebeck spin tunnelling by a factor of five, because it modifies the relevant tunnelling states and thereby the spin-dependent thermoelectric parameters. The magnitude and direction of the spin current is also modulated by combining electrical and thermal spin currents with equal or opposite sign. The results demonstrate that spin-dependent thermoelectric properties away from the Fermi energy are accessible, and open the way towards tailoring thermal spin currents and torques by voltage, rather than material design."
929,Room-temperature antiferromagnetic memory resistor,2014-01-26,"The bistability of ordered spin states in ferromagnets provides the basis for magnetic memory functionality. The latest generation of magnetic random access memories rely on an efficient approach in which magnetic fields are replaced by electrical means for writing and reading the information in ferromagnets. This concept may eventually reduce the sensitivity of ferromagnets to magnetic field perturbations to being a weakness for data retention and the ferromagnetic stray fields to an obstacle for high-density memory integration. Here we report a room-temperature bistable antiferromagnetic (AFM) memory that produces negligible stray fields and is insensitive to strong magnetic fields. We use a resistor made of a FeRh AFM, which orders ferromagnetically roughly 100 K above room temperature, and therefore allows us to set different collective directions for the Fe moments by applied magnetic field. On cooling to room temperature, AFM order sets in with the direction of the AFM moments predetermined by the field and moment direction in the high-temperature ferromagnetic state. For electrical reading, we use an AFM analogue of the anisotropic magnetoresistance. Our microscopic theory modelling confirms that this archetypical spintronic effect, discovered more than 150 years ago in ferromagnets, is also present in AFMs. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of fabricating room-temperature spintronic memories with AFMs, which in turn expands the base of available magnetic materials for devices with properties that cannot be achieved with ferromagnets."
930,Transformation of taxol-stabilized microtubules into inverted tubulin tubules triggered by a tubulin conformation switch,2014-01-19,"Bundles of taxol-stabilized microtubules (MTs)—hollow tubules comprised of assembled αβ-tubulin heterodimers—spontaneously assemble above a critical concentration of tetravalent spermine and are stable over long times at room temperature. Here we report that at concentrations of spermine several-fold higher the MT bundles (BMT) quickly become unstable and undergo a shape transformation to bundles of inverted tubulin tubules (BITT), the outside surface of which corresponds to the inner surface of the BMT tubules. Using transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering, we quantitatively determined both the nature of the BMT-to-BITT transformation pathway, which results from a spermine-triggered conformation switch from straight to curved in the constituent taxol-stabilized tubulin oligomers, and the structure of the BITT phase, which is formed of tubules of helical tubulin oligomers. Inverted tubulin tubules provide a platform for studies requiring exposure and availability of the inside, luminal surface of MTs to MT-targeted drugs and MT-associated proteins."
931,Real-space imaging of interfacial water with submolecular resolution,2014-01-05,"Water/solid interfaces are vital to our daily lives and are also a central theme across an incredibly wide range of scientific disciplines. Resolving the internal structure, that is, the O–H directionality, of water molecules adsorbed on solid surfaces has been one of the key issues of water science yet it remains challenging. Using a low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscope, we report submolecular-resolution imaging of individual water monomers and tetramers on NaCl(001) films supported by a Au(111) substrate at 5 K. The frontier molecular orbitals of adsorbed water were directly visualized, which allowed discrimination of the orientation of the monomers and the hydrogen-bond directionality of the tetramers in real space. Comparison with ab initio density functional theory calculations reveals that the ability to access the orbital structures of water stems from the electronic decoupling effect provided by the NaCl films and the precisely tunable tip–water coupling."
932,Spin-filtered edge states with an electrically tunable gap in a two-dimensional topological crystalline insulator,2013-12-22,"Three-dimensional topological crystalline insulators were recently predicted and observed in the SnTe class of IV–VI semiconductors, which host metallic surface states protected by crystal symmetries. In this work, we study thin films of these materials and expose their potential for device applications. We demonstrate that thin films of SnTe and Pb1−xSnxSe(Te) grown along the (001) direction are topologically non-trivial in a wide range of film thickness and carry conducting spin-filtered edge states that are protected by the (001) mirror symmetry through a topological invariant. Application of an electric field perpendicular to the film will break the mirror symmetry and generate a bandgap in these edge states. This functionality motivates us to propose a topological transistor device in which charge and spin transport are maximally entangled and simultaneously controlled by an electric field. The high on/off operation speed and coupling of spin and charge in such a device may lead to electronic and spintronic applications for topological crystalline insulators."
933,Semi-metallic polymers,2013-12-08,"Polymers are lightweight, flexible, solution-processable materials that are promising for low-cost printed electronics as well as for mass-produced and large-area applications. Previous studies demonstrated that they can possess insulating, semiconducting or metallic properties; here we report that polymers can also be semi-metallic. Semi-metals, exemplified by bismuth, graphite and telluride alloys, have no energy bandgap and a very low density of states at the Fermi level. Furthermore, they typically have a higher Seebeck coefficient and lower thermal conductivities compared with metals, thus being suitable for thermoelectric applications. We measure the thermoelectric properties of various poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) samples, and observe a marked increase in the Seebeck coefficient when the electrical conductivity is enhanced through molecular organization. This initiates the transition from a Fermi glass to a semi-metal. The high Seebeck value, the metallic conductivity at room temperature and the absence of unpaired electron spins makes polymer semi-metals attractive for thermoelectrics and spintronics."
934,A nanoparticle-based strategy for the imaging of a broad range of tumours by nonlinear amplification of microenvironment signals,2013-12-08,"Stimuli-responsive nanomaterials are increasingly important in a variety of applications such as biosensing, molecular imaging, drug delivery and tissue engineering. For cancer detection, a paramount challenge still exists in the search for methods that can illuminate tumours universally regardless of their genotypes and phenotypes. Here we capitalized on the acidic, angiogenic tumour microenvironment to achieve the detection of tumour tissues in a wide variety of mouse cancer models. This was accomplished using ultra pH-sensitive fluorescent nanoprobes that have tunable, exponential fluorescence activation on encountering subtle, physiologically relevant pH transitions. These nanoprobes were silent in the circulation, and then strongly activated (>300-fold) in response to the neovasculature or to the low extracellular pH in tumours. Thus, we have established non-toxic, fluorescent nanoreporters that can nonlinearly amplify tumour microenvironmental signals, permitting the identification of tumour tissue independently of histological type or driver mutation, and detection of acute treatment responses much more rapidly than conventional imaging approaches."
935,Adaptive semiconductor/electrocatalyst junctions in water-splitting photoanodes,2013-12-01,"High-efficiency photoelectrochemical water-splitting devices require the integration of electrocatalysts (ECs) with light-absorbing semiconductors (SCs), but the energetics and charge-transfer processes at SC/EC interfaces are poorly understood. We fabricate model EC-coated single-crystal TiO2 electrodes and directly probe SC/EC interfaces in situ using two working electrodes to independently monitor and control the potential and current at both the SC and the EC. We discover that redox-active ion-permeable ECs such as Ni(OH)2 or NiOOH yield ‘adaptive’ SC/EC junctions where the effective Schottky barrier height changes in situ with the oxidation level of the EC. In contrast, dense, ion-impermeable IrOx ECs yield constant-barrier-height ‘buried’ junctions. Conversion of dense, thermally deposited NiOx on TiO2 into ion-permeable Ni(OH)2 or NiOOH correlated with increased apparent photovoltage and fill factor. These results provide new insight into the dynamic behaviour of SC/EC interfaces to guide the design of efficient SC/EC devices. They also illustrate a new class of adaptive semiconductor junctions."
936,Epithelial bridges maintain tissue integrity during collective cell migration,2013-12-01,"The ability of skin to act as a barrier is primarily determined by the efficiency of skin cells to maintain and restore its continuity and integrity. In fact, during wound healing keratinocytes migrate collectively to maintain their cohesion despite heterogeneities in the extracellular matrix. Here, we show that monolayers of human keratinocytes migrating along functionalized micropatterned surfaces comprising alternating strips of extracellular matrix (fibronectin) and non-adherent polymer form suspended multicellular bridges over the non-adherent areas. The bridges are held together by intercellular adhesion and are subjected to considerable tension, as indicated by the presence of prominent actin bundles. We also show that a model based on force propagation through an elastic material reproduces the main features of bridge maintenance and tension distribution. Our findings suggest that multicellular bridges maintain tissue integrity during wound healing when cell–substrate interactions are weak and may prove helpful in the design of artificial scaffolds for skin regeneration."
937, Detection of subsurface structures underneath dendrites formed on cycled lithium metal electrodes,2013-11-24,"Failure caused by dendrite growth in high-energy-density, rechargeable batteries with lithium metal anodes has prevented their widespread use in applications ranging from consumer electronics to electric vehicles. Efforts to solve the lithium dendrite problem have focused on preventing the growth of protrusions from the anode surface. Synchrotron hard X-ray microtomography experiments on symmetric lithium–polymer–lithium cells cycled at 90 °C show that during the early stage of dendrite development, the bulk of the dendritic structure lies within the electrode, underneath the polymer/electrode interface. Furthermore, we observed crystalline impurities, present in the uncycled lithium anodes, at the base of the subsurface dendritic structures. The portion of the dendrite protruding into the electrolyte increases on cycling until it spans the electrolyte thickness, causing a short circuit. Contrary to conventional wisdom, it seems that preventing dendrite formation in polymer electrolytes depends on inhibiting the formation of subsurface structures in the lithium electrode."
938,Oxygen storage capacity and structural flexibility of LuFe,2013-11-24,"Combining functionalities in devices with high performances is a great challenge that rests on the discovery and optimization of materials. In this framework, layered oxides are attractive for numerous purposes, from energy conversion and storage to magnetic and electric properties. We demonstrate here the oxygen storage ability of ferroelectric LuFe2O4+x within a large x range (from 0 to 0.5) and its cycling possibility. The combination of thermogravimetric analyses, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy evidences a complex oxygen intercalation/de-intercalation process with several intermediate metastable states. This topotactic mechanism is mainly governed by nanoscale structures involving a shift of the cationic layers. The ferrite is highly promising because absorption begins at a low temperature (), occurs in a low oxygen pressure and the uptake of oxygen is reversible without altering the quality of the crystals. The storage/release of oxygen coupled to the transport and magnetic properties of LnFe2O4 opens the door to new tunable multifunctional applications."
939,Efficient charge generation by relaxed charge-transfer states at organic interfaces,2013-11-17,"Interfaces between organic electron-donating (D) and electron-accepting (A) materials have the ability to generate charge carriers on illumination. Efficient organic solar cells require a high yield for this process, combined with a minimum of energy losses. Here, we investigate the role of the lowest energy emissive interfacial charge-transfer state (CT1) in the charge generation process. We measure the quantum yield and the electric field dependence of charge generation on excitation of the charge-transfer (CT) state manifold via weakly allowed, low-energy optical transitions. For a wide range of photovoltaic devices based on polymer:fullerene, small-molecule:C60 and polymer:polymer blends, our study reveals that the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) is essentially independent of whether or not D, A or CT states with an energy higher than that of CT1 are excited. The best materials systems show an IQE higher than 90% without the need for excess electronic or vibrational energy."
940,Local electrostatic imaging of striped domain order in LaAlO,2013-11-17,"The emerging field of complex oxide interfaces is generically built on one of the most celebrated substrates—strontium titanate (SrTiO3). This material hosts a range of phenomena, including ferroelasticity, incipient ferroelectricity, and most puzzlingly, contested giant piezoelectricity. Although these properties may markedly influence the oxide interfaces, especially on microscopic length scales, the lack of local probes capable of studying such buried systems has left their effects largely unexplored. Here we use a scanning charge detector—a nanotube single-electron transistor—to non-invasively image the electrostatic landscape and local mechanical response in the prototypical LaAlO3/SrTiO3 system with unprecedented sensitivity. Our measurements reveal that on microscopic scales SrTiO3 exhibits large anomalous piezoelectricity with curious spatial dependence. Through electrostatic imaging we unravel the microscopic origin for this extrinsic piezoelectricity, demonstrating its direct, quantitative connection to the motion of locally ordered tetragonal domains under applied gate voltage. These domains create striped potential modulations that can markedly influence the two-dimensional electron system at the conducting interface. Our results have broad implications to all complex oxide interfaces built on SrTiO3 and demonstrate the importance of microscopic structure to the physics of electrons at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface."
941,Enabling direct H,2013-11-17,"Future generations require more efficient and localized processes for energy conversion and chemical synthesis. The continuous on-site production of hydrogen peroxide would provide an attractive alternative to the present state-of-the-art, which is based on the complex anthraquinone process. The electrochemical reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide is a particularly promising means of achieving this aim. However, it would require active, selective and stable materials to catalyse the reaction. Although progress has been made in this respect, further improvements through the development of new electrocatalysts are needed. Using density functional theory calculations, we identify Pt–Hg as a promising candidate. Electrochemical measurements on Pt–Hg nanoparticles show more than an order of magnitude improvement in mass activity, that is, A g−1 precious metal, for H2O2 production, over the best performing catalysts in the literature."
942,Observation of unconventional edge states in ‘photonic graphene’,2013-11-10,"Graphene, a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms, has been attracting much interest in recent years. Electrons therein behave as massless relativistic particles, giving rise to strikingly unconventional phenomena. Graphene edge states are essential for understanding the electronic properties of this material. However, the coarse or impure nature of the graphene edges hampers the ability to directly probe the edge states. Perhaps the best example is given by the edge states on the bearded edge that have never been observed—because such an edge is unstable in graphene. Here, we use the optical equivalent of graphene—a photonic honeycomb lattice—to study the edge states and their properties. We directly image the edge states on both the zigzag and bearded edges of this photonic graphene, measure their dispersion properties, and most importantly, find a new type of edge state: one residing on the bearded edge that has never been predicted or observed. This edge state lies near the Van Hove singularity in the edge band structure and can be classified as a Tamm-like state lacking any surface defect. The mechanism underlying its formation may counterintuitively appear in other crystalline systems."
943,Water-mediated structuring of bone apatite,2013-11-10,"It is well known that organic molecules from the vertebrate extracellular matrix of calcifying tissues are essential in structuring the apatite mineral. Here, we show that water also plays a structuring role. By using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, wide-angle X-ray scattering and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy to characterize the structure and organization of crystalline and biomimetic apatite nanoparticles as well as intact bone samples, we demonstrate that water orients apatite crystals through an amorphous calcium phosphate-like layer that coats the crystalline core of bone apatite. This disordered layer is reminiscent of those found around the crystalline core of calcified biominerals in various natural composite materials in vivo. This work provides an extended local model of bone biomineralization."
944,Origin of additional capacities in metal oxide lithium-ion battery electrodes,2013-11-03,"Metal fluorides/oxides (MFx/MxOy) are promising electrodes for lithium-ion batteries that operate through conversion reactions. These reactions are associated with much higher energy densities than intercalation reactions. The fluorides/oxides also exhibit additional reversible capacity beyond their theoretical capacity through mechanisms that are still poorly understood, in part owing to the difficulty in characterizing structure at the nanoscale, particularly at buried interfaces. This study employs high-resolution multinuclear/multidimensional solid-state NMR techniques, with in situ synchrotron-based techniques, to study the prototype conversion material RuO2. The experiments, together with theoretical calculations, show that a major contribution to the extra capacity in this system is due to the generation of LiOH and its subsequent reversible reaction with Li to form Li2O and LiH. The research demonstrates a protocol for studying the structure and spatial proximities of nanostructures formed in this system, including the amorphous solid electrolyte interphase that grows on battery electrodes."
945,Trap healing and ultralow-noise Hall effect at the surface of organic semiconductors,2013-10-27,"Fundamental studies of intrinsic charge transport properties of organic semiconductors are often hindered by charge traps associated with static disorder present even in optimized single-crystal devices. Here, we report a method of surface functionalization using an inert non-conjugated polymer, perfluoropolyether (PFPE), deposited at the surface of organic molecular crystals, which results in accumulation of mobile holes and a ‘trap healing’ effect at the crystal/PFPE interface. As a consequence, a remarkable ultralow-noise, trp-free conduction regime characterized by intrinsic mobility and transport anisotropy emerges in organic single crystals, and Hall effect measurements with an unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio are demonstrated. This general method to convert trap-dominated organic semiconductors to intrinsic systems may enable the determination of intrinsic transport parameters with high accuracy and make Hall effect measurements in molecular crystals ubiquitous."
946,Landau theory of topological defects in multiferroic hexagonal manganites,2013-10-27,"Topological defects in ordered states with spontaneously broken symmetry often have unusual physical properties, such as fractional electric charge or a quantized magnetic field flux, originating from their non-trivial topology. Coupled topological defects in systems with several coexisting orders give rise to unconventional functionalities, such as the electric-field control of magnetization in multiferroics resulting from the coupling between the ferroelectric and ferromagnetic domain walls. Hexagonal manganites provide an extra degree of freedom: in these materials, both ferroelectricity and magnetism are coupled to an additional, non-ferroelectric structural order parameter. Here we present a theoretical study of topological defects in hexagonal manganites based on Landau theory with parameters determined from first-principles calculations. We explain the observed flip of electric polarization at the boundaries of structural domains, the origin of the observed discrete vortices, and the clamping between ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic domain walls. We show that structural vortices induce magnetic ones and that, consistent with a recent experimental report, ferroelectric domain walls can carry a magnetic moment."
947,Highly sensitive nanoscale spin-torque diode,2013-10-20,"Highly sensitive microwave devices that are operational at room temperature are important for high-speed multiplex telecommunications. Quantum devices such as superconducting bolometers possess high performance but work only at low temperature. On the other hand, semiconductor devices, although enabling high-speed operation at room temperature, have poor signal-to-noise ratios. In this regard, the demonstration of a diode based on spin-torque-induced ferromagnetic resonance between nanomagnets represented a promising development, even though the rectification output was too small for applications (1.4 mV mW−1). Here we show that by applying d.c. bias currents to nanomagnets while precisely controlling their magnetization-potential profiles, a much greater radiofrequency detection sensitivity of 12,000 mV mW−1 is achievable at room temperature, exceeding that of semiconductor diode detectors (3,800 mV mW−1). Theoretical analysis reveals essential roles for nonlinear ferromagnetic resonance, which enhances the signal-to-noise ratio even at room temperature as the size of the magnets decreases."
948,Biophysical regulation of epigenetic state and cell reprogramming,2013-10-20,"Biochemical factors can help reprogram somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells, yet the role of biophysical factors during reprogramming is unknown. Here, we show that biophysical cues, in the form of parallel microgrooves on the surface of cell-adhesive substrates, can replace the effects of small-molecule epigenetic modifiers and significantly improve reprogramming efficiency. The mechanism relies on the mechanomodulation of the cells’ epigenetic state. Specifically, decreased histone deacetylase activity and upregulation of the expression of WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5)—a subunit of H3 methyltranferase—by microgrooved surfaces lead to increased histone H3 acetylation and methylation. We also show that microtopography promotes a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in adult fibroblasts. Nanofibrous scaffolds with aligned fibre orientation produce effects similar to those produced by microgrooves, suggesting that changes in cell morphology may be responsible for modulation of the epigenetic state. These findings have important implications in cell biology and in the optimization of biomaterials for cell-engineering applications."
949,Molecular mechanisms of cellular mechanosensing,2013-10-20,"Mechanical forces direct a host of cellular and tissue processes. Although much emphasis has been placed on cell-adhesion complexes as force sensors, the forces must nevertheless be transmitted through the cortical cytoskeleton. Yet how the actin cortex senses and transmits forces and how cytoskeletal proteins interact in response to the forces is poorly understood. Here, by combining molecular and mechanical experimental perturbations with theoretical multiscale modelling, we decipher cortical mechanosensing from molecular to cellular scales. We show that forces are shared between myosin II and different actin crosslinkers, with myosin having potentiating or inhibitory effects on certain crosslinkers. Different types of cell deformation elicit distinct responses, with myosin and α-actinin responding to dilation, and filamin mainly reacting to shear. Our observations show that the accumulation kinetics of each protein may be explained by its molecular mechanisms, and that protein accumulation and the cell’s viscoelastic state can explain cell contraction against mechanical load."
950, cell manipulation through enzymatic hydrogel photopatterning,2013-10-13,"The physicochemical properties of hydrogels can be manipulated in both space and time through the controlled application of a light beam. However, methods for hydrogel photopatterning either fail to maintain the bioactivity of fragile proteins and are thus limited to short peptides, or have been used in hydrogels that often do not support three-dimensional (3D) cell growth. Here, we show that the 3D invasion of primary human mesenchymal stem cells can be spatiotemporally controlled by micropatterning the hydrogel with desired extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and growth factors. A peptide substrate of activated transglutaminase factor XIII (FXIIIa)—a key ECM crosslinking enzyme—is rendered photosensitive by masking its active site with a photolabile cage group. Covalent incorporation of the caged FXIIIa substrate into poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels and subsequent laser-scanning lithography affords highly localized biomolecule tethering. This approach for the 3D manipulation of cells within gels should open up avenues for the study and manipulation of cell signalling."
951,Snapshots of non-equilibrium Dirac carrier distributions in graphene,2013-10-06,"The optical properties of graphene are made unique by the linear band structure and the vanishing density of states at the Dirac point. It has been proposed that even in the absence of a bandgap, a relaxation bottleneck at the Dirac point may allow for population inversion and lasing at arbitrarily long wavelengths. Furthermore, efficient carrier multiplication by impact ionization has been discussed in the context of light harvesting applications. However, all of these effects are difficult to test quantitatively by measuring the transient optical properties alone, as these only indirectly reflect the energy- and momentum-dependent carrier distributions. Here, we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with femtosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulses to directly probe the non-equilibrium response of Dirac electrons near the K-point of the Brillouin zone. In lightly hole-doped epitaxial graphene samples, we explore excitation in the mid- and near-infrared, both below and above the minimum photon energy for direct interband transitions. Whereas excitation in the mid-infrared results only in heating of the equilibrium carrier distribution, interband excitations give rise to population inversion, suggesting that terahertz lasing may be possible. However, in neither excitation regime do we find any indication of carrier multiplication, questioning the applicability of graphene for light harvesting."
952,Ultrathin conformal devices for precise and continuous thermal characterization of human skin,2013-09-15,"Precision thermometry of the skin can, together with other measurements, provide clinically relevant information about cardiovascular health, cognitive state, malignancy and many other important aspects of human physiology. Here, we introduce an ultrathin, compliant skin-like sensor/actuator technology that can pliably laminate onto the epidermis to provide continuous, accurate thermal characterizations that are unavailable with other methods. Examples include non-invasive spatial mapping of skin temperature with millikelvin precision, and simultaneous quantitative assessment of tissue thermal conductivity. Such devices can also be implemented in ways that reveal the time-dynamic influence of blood flow and perfusion on these properties. Experimental and theoretical studies establish the underlying principles of operation, and define engineering guidelines for device design. Evaluation of subtle variations in skin temperature associated with mental activity, physical stimulation and vasoconstriction/dilation along with accurate determination of skin hydration through measurements of thermal conductivity represent some important operational examples."
953,A stable cathode for the aprotic Li–O,2013-09-01,"Rechargeable lithium–air (O2) batteries are receiving intense interest because their high theoretical specific energy exceeds that of lithium-ion batteries. If the Li–O2 battery is ever to succeed, highly reversible formation/decomposition of Li2O2 must take place at the cathode on cycling. However, carbon, used ubiquitously as the basis of the cathode, decomposes during Li2O2 oxidation on charge and actively promotes electrolyte decomposition on cycling. Replacing carbon with a nanoporous gold cathode, when in contact with a dimethyl sulphoxide-based electrolyte, does seem to demonstrate better stability. However, nanoporous gold is not a suitable cathode; its high mass destroys the key advantage of Li–O2 over Li ion (specific energy), it is too expensive and too difficult to fabricate. Identifying a suitable cathode material for the Li–O2 cell is one of the greatest challenges at present. Here we show that a TiC-based cathode reduces greatly side reactions (arising from the electrolyte and electrode degradation) compared with carbon and exhibits better reversible formation/decomposition of Li2O2 even than nanoporous gold (>98% capacity retention after 100 cycles, compared with 95% for nanoporous gold); it is also four times lighter, of lower cost and easier to fabricate. The stability may originate from the presence of TiO2 (along with some TiOC) on the surface of TiC. In contrast to carbon or nanoporous gold, TiC seems to represent a more viable, stable, cathode for aprotic Li–O2 cells."
954,Reversible redox reactions in an epitaxially stabilized SrCoO,2013-08-25,"Fast, reversible redox reactions in solids at low temperatures without thermomechanical degradation are a promising strategy for enhancing the overall performance and lifetime of many energy materials and devices. However, the robust nature of the cation’s oxidation state and the high thermodynamic barrier have hindered the realization of fast catalysis and bulk diffusion at low temperatures. Here, we report a significant lowering of the redox temperature by epitaxial stabilization of strontium cobaltites (SrCoOx) grown directly as one of two distinct crystalline phases, either the perovskite SrCoO3−δ or the brownmillerite SrCoO2.5. Importantly, these two phases can be reversibly switched at a remarkably reduced temperature (200–300 °C) in a considerably short time (< 1 min) without destroying the parent framework. The fast, low-temperature redox activity in SrCoO3−δ is attributed to a small Gibbs free-energy difference between two topotatic phases. Our findings thus provide useful information for developing highly sensitive electrochemical sensors and low-temperature cathode materials."
955,Uncovering the intrinsic size dependence of hydriding phase transformations in nanocrystals,2013-08-04,"A quantitative understanding of nanocrystal phase transformations would enable more efficient energy conversion and catalysis, but has been hindered by difficulties in directly monitoring well-characterized nanoscale systems in reactive environments. We present a new in situ luminescence-based probe enabling direct quantification of nanocrystal phase transformations, applied here to the hydriding transformation of palladium nanocrystals. Our approach reveals the intrinsic kinetics and thermodynamics of nanocrystal phase transformations, eliminating complications of substrate strain, ligand effects and external signal transducers. Clear size-dependent trends emerge in nanocrystals long accepted to be bulk-like in behaviour. Statistical mechanical simulations show these trends to be a consequence of nanoconfinement of a thermally driven, first-order phase transition: near the phase boundary, critical nuclei of the new phase are comparable in size to the nanocrystal itself. Transformation rates are then unavoidably governed by nanocrystal dimensions. Our results provide a general framework for understanding how nanoconfinement fundamentally impacts broad classes of thermally driven solid-state phase transformations relevant to hydrogen storage, catalysis, batteries and fuel cells."
956,"A general relationship between disorder, aggregation and charge transport in conjugated polymers",2013-08-04,"Conjugated polymer chains have many degrees of conformational freedom and interact weakly with each other, resulting in complex microstructures in the solid state. Understanding charge transport in such systems, which have amorphous and ordered phases exhibiting varying degrees of order, has proved difficult owing to the contribution of electronic processes at various length scales. The growing technological appeal of these semiconductors makes such fundamental knowledge extremely important for materials and process design. We propose a unified model of how charge carriers travel in conjugated polymer films. We show that in high-molecular-weight semiconducting polymers the limiting charge transport step is trapping caused by lattice disorder, and that short-range intermolecular aggregation is sufficient for efficient long-range charge transport. This generalization explains the seemingly contradicting high performance of recently reported, poorly ordered polymers and suggests molecular design strategies to further improve the performance of future generations of organic electronic materials."
957,Physical hydrogels composed of polyampholytes demonstrate high toughness and viscoelasticity,2013-07-28,"Hydrogels attract great attention as biomaterials as a result of their soft and wet nature, similar to that of biological tissues. Recent inventions of several tough hydrogels show their potential as structural biomaterials, such as cartilage. Any given application, however, requires a combination of mechanical properties including stiffness, strength, toughness, damping, fatigue resistance and self-healing, along with biocompatibility. This combination is rarely realized. Here, we report that polyampholytes, polymers bearing randomly dispersed cationic and anionic repeat groups, form tough and viscoelastic hydrogels with multiple mechanical properties. The randomness makes ionic bonds of a wide distribution of strength. The strong bonds serve as permanent crosslinks, imparting elasticity, whereas the weak bonds reversibly break and re-form, dissipating energy. These physical hydrogels of supramolecular structure can be tuned to change multiple mechanical properties over wide ranges by using diverse ionic combinations. This polyampholyte approach is synthetically simple and dramatically increases the choice of tough hydrogels for applications."
958,Measurement of molecular motion in organic semiconductors by thermal diffuse electron scattering,2013-07-28,"Many of the remarkable electrical and optical properties of organic semiconductors are governed by the interaction of electronic excitations with intra- and intermolecular vibrational modes. However, in specific systems this interaction is not understood in detail at a molecular level and this has been due, at least in part, to the lack of easy-to-use and widely available experimental probes of the structural dynamics. Here we demonstrate that thermal diffuse scattering in electron diffraction patterns from organic semiconductors, such as 6,13-bistriisopropyl-silylethynyl pentacene, allows the dominant lattice vibrational modes to be probed directly. The amplitude and direction of the dominant molecular motions were determined by comparison of the diffuse scattering with simulations and molecular dynamics calculations. Our widely applicable approach enables a much deeper understanding of the structural dynamics in a broad range of organic semiconductors."
959,The effect of particle proximity on the oxygen reduction rate of size-selected platinum clusters,2013-07-21,"The diminished surface-area-normalized catalytic activity of highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles compared with bulk Pt is particularly intricate, and not yet understood. Here we report on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of well-defined, size-selected Pt nanoclusters; a unique approach that allows precise control of both the cluster size and coverage, independently. Our investigations reveal that size-selected Pt nanoclusters can reach extraordinarily high ORR activities, especially in terms of mass-normalized activity, if deposited at high coverage on a glassy carbon substrate. It is observed that the Pt cluster coverage, and hence the interparticle distance, decisively influence the observed catalytic activity and that closely packed assemblies of Pt clusters approach the surface activity of bulk Pt. Our results open up new strategies for the design of catalyst materials that circumvent the detrimental dispersion effect, and may eventually allow the full electrocatalytic potential of Pt nanoclusters to be realized."
960,Effect of airborne contaminants on the wettability of supported graphene and graphite,2013-07-21,"It is generally accepted that supported graphene is hydrophobic and that its water contact angle is similar to that of graphite. Here, we show that the water contact angles of freshly prepared supported graphene and graphite surfaces increase when they are exposed to ambient air. By using infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy we demonstrate that airborne hydrocarbons adsorb on graphitic surfaces, and that a concurrent decrease in the water contact angle occurs when these contaminants are partially removed by both thermal annealing and controlled ultraviolet–O3 treatment. Our findings indicate that graphitic surfaces are more hydrophilic than previously believed, and suggest that previously reported data on the wettability of graphitic surfaces may have been affected by unintentional hydrocarbon contamination from ambient air."
961,Thermoelectric imaging of structural disorder in epitaxial graphene,2013-07-14,"Heat is a familiar form of energy transported from a hot side to a colder side of an object, but not a notion associated with microscopic measurements of electronic properties. A temperature difference within a material causes charge carriers, electrons or holes to diffuse along the temperature gradient inducing a thermoelectric voltage. Here we show that local thermoelectric measurements can yield high-sensitivity imaging of structural disorder on the atomic and nanometre scales. The thermopower measurement acts to amplify the variations in the local density of states at the Fermi level, giving high differential contrast in thermoelectric signals. Using this imaging technique, we uncovered point defects in the first layer of epitaxial graphene, which generate soliton-like domain-wall line patterns separating regions of the different interlayer stacking of the second graphene layer."
962,"Generation, transport and detection of valley-polarized electrons in diamond",2013-07-14,"Standard electronic devices encode bits of information by controlling the amount of electric charge in the circuits. Alternatively, it is possible to make devices that rely on other properties of electrons than their charge. For example, spintronic devices make use of the electron spin angular momentum as a carrier of information. A new concept is valleytronics in which information is encoded by the valley quantum number of the electron. The analogy between the valley and spin degrees of freedom also implies the possibility of valley-based quantum computing. In this Article, we demonstrate for the first time generation, transport (across macroscopic distances) and detection of valley-polarized electrons in bulk diamond with a relaxation time of 300 ns at 77 K. We anticipate that these results will form the basis for the development of integrated valleytronic devices."
963,Reversible anionic redox chemistry in high-capacity layered-oxide electrodes,2013-07-14,"Li-ion batteries have contributed to the commercial success of portable electronics and may soon dominate the electric transportation market provided that major scientific advances including new materials and concepts are developed. Classical positive electrodes for Li-ion technology operate mainly through an insertion–deinsertion redox process involving cationic species. However, this mechanism is insufficient to account for the high capacities exhibited by the new generation of Li-rich (Li1+xNiyCozMn(1−x−y−z)O2) layered oxides that present unusual Li reactivity. In an attempt to overcome both the inherent composition and the structural complexity of this class of oxides, we have designed structurally related Li2Ru1−ySnyO3 materials that have a single redox cation and exhibit sustainable reversible capacities as high as 230 mA h g−1. Moreover, they present good cycling behaviour with no signs of voltage decay and a small irreversible capacity. We also unambiguously show, on the basis of an arsenal of characterization techniques, that the reactivity of these high-capacity materials towards Li entails cumulative cationic (Mn+→M(n+1)+) and anionic (O2−→O22−) reversible redox processes, owing to the d–s p hybridization associated with a reductive coupling mechanism. Because Li2MO3 is a large family of compounds, this study opens the door to the exploration of a vast number of high-capacity materials."
964,Enhanced catalytic activity in strained chemically exfoliated WS,2013-07-07,"Efficient evolution of hydrogen through electrocatalysis at low overpotentials holds tremendous promise for clean energy. Hydrogen evolution can be easily achieved by electrolysis at large potentials that can be lowered with expensive platinum-based catalysts. Replacement of Pt with inexpensive, earth-abundant electrocatalysts would be significantly beneficial for clean and efficient hydrogen evolution. To this end, promising results have been reported using 2H (trigonal prismatic) XS2 (where X = Mo or W) nanoparticles with a high concentration of metallic edges. The key challenges for XS2 are increasing the number and catalytic activity of active sites. Here we report monolayered nanosheets of chemically exfoliated WS2 as efficient catalysts for hydrogen evolution with very low overpotentials. Analyses indicate that the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of WS2 is associated with the high concentration of the strained metallic 1T (octahedral) phase in the as-exfoliated nanosheets. Our results suggest that chemically exfoliated WS2 nanosheets are interesting catalysts for hydrogen evolution."
965,Identifying champion nanostructures for solar water-splitting,2013-07-07,"Charge transport in nanoparticle-based materials underlies many emerging energy-conversion technologies, yet assessing the impact of nanometre-scale structure on charge transport across micrometre-scale distances remains a challenge. Here we develop an approach for correlating the spatial distribution of crystalline and current-carrying domains in entire nanoparticle aggregates. We apply this approach to nanoparticle-based α-Fe2O3 electrodes that are of interest in solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion. In correlating structure and charge transport with nanometre resolution across micrometre-scale distances, we have identified the existence of champion nanoparticle aggregates that are most responsible for the high photoelectrochemical activity of the present electrodes. Indeed, when electrodes are fabricated with a high proportion of these champion nanostructures, the electrodes achieve the highest photocurrent of any metal oxide photoanode for photoelectrochemical water-splitting under 100 mW cm−2 air mass 1.5 global sunlight."
966,Photo-illuminated diamond as a solid-state source of solvated electrons in water for nitrogen reduction,2013-06-30,"The photocatalytic reduction of N2 to NH3 is typically hampered by poor binding of N2 to catalytic materials and by the very high energy of the intermediates involved in this reaction. Solvated electrons directly introduced into the reactant solution can provide an alternative pathway to overcome such limitations. Here we demonstrate that illuminated hydrogen-terminated diamond yields facile electron emission into water, thus inducing reduction of N2 to NH3 at ambient temperature and pressure. Transient absorption measurements at 632 nm reveal the presence of solvated electrons adjacent to the diamond after photoexcitation. Experiments using inexpensive synthetic diamond samples and diamond powder show that photocatalytic activity is strongly dependent on the surface termination and correlates with the production of solvated electrons. The use of diamond to eject electrons into a reactant liquid represents a new paradigm for photocatalytic reduction, bringing electrons directly to reactants without requiring molecular adsorption to the surface."
967,Electron-pinned defect-dipoles for high-performance colossal permittivity materials,2013-06-30,"The immense potential of colossal permittivity (CP) materials for use in modern microelectronics as well as for high-energy-density storage applications has propelled much recent research and development. Despite the discovery of several new classes of CP materials, the development of such materials with the required high performance is still a highly challenging task. Here, we propose a new electron-pinned, defect-dipole route to ideal CP behaviour, where hopping electrons are localized by designated lattice defect states to generate giant defect-dipoles and result in high-performance CP materials. We present a concrete example, (Nb+In) co-doped TiO2 rutile, that exhibits a largely temperature- and frequency-independent colossal permittivity (> 104) as well as a low dielectric loss (mostly < 0.05) over a very broad temperature range from 80 to 450 K. A systematic defect analysis coupled with density functional theory modelling suggests that ‘triangular’ In23+VO••Ti3+ and ‘diamond’ shaped Nb25+Ti3+ATi (A = Ti3+/In3+/Ti4+) defect complexes are strongly correlated, giving rise to large defect-dipole clusters containing highly localized electrons that are together responsible for the excellent CP properties observed in co-doped TiO2. This combined experimental and theoretical work opens up a promising feasible route to the systematic development of new high-performance CP materials via defect engineering."
968,Mobility engineering and a metal–insulator transition in monolayer MoS,2013-06-23,"Two-dimensional (2D) materials are a new class of materials with interesting physical properties and applications ranging from nanoelectronics to sensing and photonics. In addition to graphene, the most studied 2D material, monolayers of other layered materials such as semiconducting dichalcogenides MoS2 or WSe2 are gaining in importance as promising channel materials for field-effect transistors (FETs). The presence of a direct bandgap in monolayer MoS2 due to quantum-mechanical confinement allows room-temperature FETs with an on/off ratio exceeding 108. The presence of high- κ dielectrics in these devices enhanced their mobility, but the mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report on electrical transport measurements on MoS2 FETs in different dielectric configurations. The dependence of mobility on temperature shows clear evidence of the strong suppression of charged-impurity scattering in dual-gate devices with a top-gate dielectric. At the same time, phonon scattering shows a weaker than expected temperature dependence. High levels of doping achieved in dual-gate devices also allow the observation of a metal–insulator transition in monolayer MoS2 due to strong electron–electron interactions. Our work opens up the way to further improvements in 2D semiconductor performance and introduces MoS2 as an interesting system for studying correlation effects in mesoscopic systems."
969,Propulsion and navigation within the advancing monolayer sheet,2013-06-23,"As a wound heals, or a body plan forms, or a tumour invades, observed cellular motions within the advancing cell swarm are thought to stem from yet to be observed physical stresses that act in some direct and causal mechanical fashion. Here we show that such a relationship between motion and stress is far from direct. Using monolayer stress microscopy, we probed migration velocities, cellular tractions and intercellular stresses in an epithelial cell sheet advancing towards an island on which cells cannot adhere. We found that cells located near the island exert tractions that pull systematically towards this island regardless of whether the cells approach the island, migrate tangentially along its edge, or paradoxically, recede from it. This unanticipated cell-patterning motif, which we call kenotaxis, represents the robust and systematic mechanical drive of the cellular collective to fill unfilled space."
970,Compositional segregation in shaped Pt alloy nanoparticles and their structural behaviour during electrocatalysis,2013-06-16,"Shape-selective monometallic nanocatalysts offer activity benefits based on structural sensitivity and high surface area. In bimetallic nanoalloys with well-defined shape, site-dependent metal surface segregation additionally affects the catalytic activity and stability. However, segregation on shaped alloy nanocatalysts and their atomic-scale evolution is largely unexplored. Exemplified by three octahedral PtxNi1−x alloy nanoparticle electrocatalysts with unique activity for the oxygen reduction reaction at fuel cell cathodes, we reveal an unexpected compositional segregation structure across the {111} facets using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. In contrast to theoretical predictions, the pristine PtxNi1−x nano-octahedra feature a Pt-rich frame along their edges and corners, whereas their Ni atoms are preferentially segregated in their {111} facet region. We follow their morphological and compositional evolution in electrochemical environments and correlate this with their exceptional catalytic activity. The octahedra preferentially leach in their facet centres and evolve into ‘concave octahedra’. More generally, the segregation and leaching mechanisms revealed here highlight the complexity with which shape-selective nanoalloys form and evolve under reactive conditions."
971,Piezoelectric control of the mobility of a domain wall driven by adiabatic and non-adiabatic torques,2013-06-09,"The rich internal degrees of freedom of magnetic domain walls make them an attractive complement to electron charge for exploring new concepts of storage, transport and processing of information. Here we use the tunable internal structure of a domain wall in a perpendicularly magnetized GaMnAsP/GaAs ferromagnetic semiconductor and demonstrate devices in which piezoelectrically controlled magnetic anisotropy yields up to 500% mobility variations for an electrical-current-driven domain wall. We observe current-induced domain wall motion over a wide range of current-pulse amplitudes and report a direct observation and the piezoelectric control of the Walker breakdown separating two regimes with different mobilities. Our work demonstrates that in spin–orbit-coupled ferromagnets with weak extrinsic domain wall pinning, the piezoelectric control allows one to experimentally assess the upper and lower boundaries of the characteristic ratio of adiabatic and non-adiabatic spin-transfer torques in the current-driven domain wall motion."
972,Vapour phase growth and grain boundary structure of molybdenum disulphide atomic layers,2013-06-09,"Single-layered molybdenum disulphide with a direct bandgap is a promising two-dimensional material that goes beyond graphene for the next generation of nanoelectronics. Here, we report the controlled vapour phase synthesis of molybdenum disulphide atomic layers and elucidate a fundamental mechanism for the nucleation, growth, and grain boundary formation in its crystalline monolayers. Furthermore, a nucleation-controlled strategy is established to systematically promote the formation of large-area, single- and few-layered films. Using high-resolution electron microscopy imaging, the atomic structure and morphology of the grains and their boundaries in the polycrystalline molybdenum disulphide atomic layers are examined, and the primary mechanisms for grain boundary formation are evaluated. Grain boundaries consisting of 5- and 7- member rings are directly observed with atomic resolution, and their energy landscape is investigated via first-principles calculations. The uniformity in thickness, large grain sizes, and excellent electrical performance signify the high quality and scalable synthesis of the molybdenum disulphide atomic layers."
973,Solution coating of large-area organic semiconductor thin films with aligned single-crystalline domains,2013-06-02,"Solution coating of organic semiconductors offers great potential for achieving low-cost manufacturing of large-area and flexible electronics. However, the rapid coating speed needed for industrial-scale production poses challenges to the control of thin-film morphology. Here, we report an approach—termed fluid-enhanced crystal engineering (FLUENCE)—that allows for a high degree of morphological control of solution-printed thin films. We designed a micropillar-patterned printing blade to induce recirculation in the ink for enhancing crystal growth, and engineered the curvature of the ink meniscus to control crystal nucleation. Using FLUENCE, we demonstrate the fast coating and patterning of millimetre-wide, centimetre-long, highly aligned single-crystalline organic semiconductor thin films. In particular, we fabricated thin films of 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene having non-equilibrium single-crystalline domains and an unprecedented average and maximum mobilities of 8.1±1.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 11 cm2 V−1 s−1. FLUENCE of organic semiconductors with non-equilibrium single-crystalline domains may find use in the fabrication of high-performance, large-area printed electronics."
974,Interface-induced superconductivity and strain-dependent spin density waves in FeSe/SrTiO,2013-05-26,"The record superconducting transition temperature (Tc) for the iron-based high-temperature superconductors (Fe-HTS) has long been 56 K. Recently, in single-layer FeSe films grown on SrTiO3 substrates, indications of a new record of 65 K have been reported. Using in situ photoemission measurements, we substantiate the presence of spin density waves (SDWs) in FeSe films—a key ingredient of Fe-HTS that was missed in FeSe before—and we find that this weakens with increased thickness or reduced strain. We demonstrate that the superconductivity occurs when the electrons transferred from the oxygen-vacant substrate suppress the otherwise pronounced SDWs in single-layer FeSe. Beyond providing a comprehensive understanding of FeSe films and directions to further enhance its Tc, we map out the phase diagram of FeSe as a function of lattice constant, which contains all the essential physics of Fe-HTS. With the simplest structure, cleanest composition and single tuning parameter, monolayer FeSe is an ideal system for testing theories of Fe-HTS."
975,Proton trapping in yttrium-doped barium zirconate,2013-05-12,"The environmental benefits of fuel cells have been increasingly appreciated in recent years. Among candidate electrolytes for solid-oxide fuel cells, yttrium-doped barium zirconate has garnered attention because of its high proton conductivity, particularly in the intermediate-temperature region targeted for cost-effective solid-oxide fuel cell operation, and its excellent chemical stability. However, fundamental questions surrounding the defect chemistry and macroscopic proton transport mechanism of this material remain, especially in regard to the possible role of proton trapping. Here we show, through a combined thermogravimetric and a.c. impedance study, that macroscopic proton transport in yttrium-doped barium zirconate is limited by proton–dopant association (proton trapping). Protons must overcome the association energy, 29 kJ mol−1, as well as the general activation energy, 16 kJ mol−1, to achieve long-range transport. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance studies show the presence of two types of proton environment above room temperature, reflecting differences in proton–dopant configurations. This insight motivates efforts to identify suitable alternative dopants with reduced association energies as a route to higher conductivities."
976,H,2013-05-05,"Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting represents a promising route for renewable production of hydrogen, but trade-offs between photoelectrode stability and efficiency have greatly limited the performance of PEC devices. In this work, we employ a metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) photoelectrode architecture that allows for stable and efficient water splitting using narrow bandgap semiconductors. Substantial improvement in the performance of Si-based MIS photocathodes is demonstrated through a combination of a high-quality thermal SiO2 layer and the use of bilayer metal catalysts. Scanning probe techniques were used to simultaneously map the photovoltaic and catalytic properties of the MIS surface and reveal the spillover-assisted evolution of hydrogen off the SiO2 surface and lateral photovoltage driven minority carrier transport over distances that can exceed 2 cm. The latter finding is explained by the photo- and electrolyte-induced formation of an inversion channel immediately beneath the SiO2/Si interface. These findings have important implications for further development of MIS photoelectrodes and offer the possibility of highly efficient PEC water splitting."
977,A transparent organic transistor structure for bidirectional stimulation and recording of primary neurons,2013-05-05,"Real-time stimulation and recording of neural cell bioelectrical activity could provide an unprecedented insight in understanding the functions of the nervous system, and it is crucial for developing advanced in vitro drug screening approaches. Among organic materials, suitable candidates for cell interfacing can be found that combine long-term biocompatibility and mechanical flexibility. Here, we report on transparent organic cell stimulating and sensing transistors (O-CSTs), which provide bidirectional stimulation and recording of primary neurons. We demonstrate that the device enables depolarization and hyperpolarization of the primary neuron membrane potential. The transparency of the device also allows the optical imaging of the modulation of the neuron bioelectrical activity. The maximal amplitude-to-noise ratio of the extracellular recording achieved by the O-CST device exceeds that of a microelectrode array system on the same neuronal preparation by a factor of 16. Our organic cell stimulating and sensing device paves the way to a new generation of devices for stimulation, manipulation and recording of cell bioelectrical activity in vitro and in vivo."
978,Grains and grain boundaries in highly crystalline monolayer molybdenum disulphide,2013-05-05,"Recent progress in large-area synthesis of monolayer molybdenum disulphide, a new two-dimensional direct-bandgap semiconductor, is paving the way for applications in atomically thin electronics. Little is known, however, about the microstructure of this material. Here we have refined chemical vapour deposition synthesis to grow highly crystalline islands of monolayer molybdenum disulphide up to 120 μm in size with optical and electrical properties comparable or superior to exfoliated samples. Using transmission electron microscopy, we correlate lattice orientation, edge morphology and crystallinity with island shape to demonstrate that triangular islands are single crystals. The crystals merge to form faceted tilt and mirror twin boundaries that are stitched together by lines of 8- and 4-membered rings. Density functional theory reveals localized mid-gap states arising from these 8–4 defects. We find that mirror twin boundaries cause strong photoluminescence quenching whereas tilt boundaries cause strong enhancement. Meanwhile, mirror twin boundaries slightly increase the measured in-plane electrical conductivity, whereas tilt boundaries slightly decrease the conductivity."
979,Crafting the magnonic and spintronic response of BiFeO,2013-04-28,"Multiferroics are compounds that show ferroelectricity and magnetism. BiFeO3, by far the most studied, has outstanding ferroelectric properties, a cycloidal magnetic order in the bulk, and many unexpected virtues such as conductive domain walls or a low bandgap of interest for photovoltaics. Although this flurry of properties makes BiFeO3 a paradigmatic multifunctional material, most are related to its ferroelectric character, and its other ferroic property—antiferromagnetism—has not been investigated extensively, especially in thin films. Here we bring insight into the rich spin physics of BiFeO3 in a detailed study of the static and dynamic magnetic response of strain-engineered films. Using Mössbauer and Raman spectroscopies combined with Landau–Ginzburg theory and effective Hamiltonian calculations, we show that the bulk-like cycloidal spin modulation that exists at low compressive strain is driven towards pseudo-collinear antiferromagnetism at high strain, both tensile and compressive. For moderate tensile strain we also predict and observe indications of a new cycloid. Accordingly, we find that the magnonic response is entirely modified, with low-energy magnon modes being suppressed as strain increases. Finally, we reveal that strain progressively drives the average spin angle from in-plane to out-of-plane, a property we use to tune the exchange bias and giant-magnetoresistive response of spin valves."
980,Unidirectional spin-wave heat conveyer,2013-04-21,"When energy is introduced into a region of matter, it heats up and the local temperature increases. This energy spontaneously diffuses away from the heated region. In general, heat should flow from warmer to cooler regions and it is not possible to externally change the direction of heat conduction. Here we show a magnetically controllable heat flow caused by a spin-wave current. The direction of the flow can be switched by applying a magnetic field. When microwave energy is applied to a region of ferrimagnetic Y3Fe5O12, an end of the magnet far from this region is found to be heated in a controlled manner and a negative temperature gradient towards it is formed. This is due to unidirectional energy transfer by the excitation of spin-wave modes without time-reversal symmetry and to the conversion of spin waves into heat. When a Y3Fe5O12 film with low damping coefficients is used, spin waves are observed to emit heat at the sample end up to 10 mm away from the excitation source. The magnetically controlled remote heating we observe is directly applicable to the fabrication of a heat-flow controller."
981,Nano-analytical electron microscopy reveals fundamental insights into human cardiovascular tissue calcification,2013-04-21,"The accumulation of calcified material in cardiovascular tissue is thought to involve cytochemical, extracellular matrix and systemic signals; however, its precise composition and nanoscale architecture remain largely unexplored. Using nano-analytical electron microscopy techniques, we examined valves, aortae and coronary arteries from patients with and without calcific cardiovascular disease and detected spherical calcium phosphate particles, regardless of the presence of calcific lesions. We also examined lesions after sectioning with a focused ion beam and found that the spherical particles are composed of highly crystalline hydroxyapatite that crystallographically and structurally differs from bone mineral. Taken together, these data suggest that mineralized spherical particles may play a fundamental role in calcific lesion formation. Their ubiquitous presence in varied cardiovascular tissues and from patients with a spectrum of diseases further suggests that lesion formation may follow a common process. Indeed, applying materials science techniques to ectopic and orthotopic calcification has great potential to lend critical insights into pathophysiological processes underlying calcific cardiovascular disease."
982,Multiple quantum criticality in a two-dimensional superconductor,2013-04-14,"The diverse phenomena associated with the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) that occurs at oxide interfaces include, among others, exceptional carrier mobilities, magnetism and superconductivity. Although these have mostly been the focus of interest for potential future applications, they also offer an opportunity for studying more fundamental quantum many-body effects. Here, we examine the magnetic-field-driven quantum phase transition that occurs in electrostatically gated superconducting LaTiO3/SrTiO3 interfaces. Through a finite-size scaling analysis, we show that it belongs to the (2+1)D X Y model universality class. The system can be described as a disordered array of superconducting puddles coupled by a 2DEG and, depending on its conductance, the observed critical behaviour is single (corresponding to the long-range phase coherence in the whole array) or double (one related to local phase coherence, the other one to the array). A phase diagram illustrating the dependence of the critical field on the 2DEG conductance is constructed, and shown to agree with theoretical proposals. Moreover, by retrieving the coherence-length critical exponent ν, we show that the quantum critical behaviour can be clean or dirty according to the Harris criterion, depending on whether the phase-coherence length is smaller or larger than the size of the puddles."
983,Memory effect in a lithium-ion battery,2013-04-14,"Memory effects are well known to users of nickel–cadmium and nickel–metal-hydride batteries. If these batteries are recharged repeatedly after being only partially discharged, they gradually lose usable capacity owing to a reduced working voltage. Lithium-ion batteries, in contrast, are considered to have no memory effect. Here we report a memory effect in LiFePO4—one of the materials used for the positive electrode in Li-ion batteries—that appears already after only one cycle of partial charge and discharge. We characterize this memory effect of LiFePO4 and explain its connection to the particle-by-particle charge/discharge model. This effect is important for most battery uses, as the slight voltage change it causes can lead to substantial miscalculations in estimating the state of charge of batteries."
984,Molecular-scale simulation of electroluminescence in a multilayer white organic light-emitting diode,2013-04-14,"In multilayer white organic light-emitting diodes the electronic processes in the various layers—injection and motion of charges as well as generation, diffusion and radiative decay of excitons—should be concerted such that efficient, stable and colour-balanced electroluminescence can occur. Here we show that it is feasible to carry out Monte Carlo simulations including all of these molecular-scale processes for a hybrid multilayer organic light-emitting diode combining red and green phosphorescent layers with a blue fluorescent layer. The simulated current density and emission profile are shown to agree well with experiment. The experimental emission profile was obtained with nanometre resolution from the measured angle- and polarization-dependent emission spectra. The simulations elucidate the crucial role of exciton transfer from green to red and the efficiency loss due to excitons generated in the interlayer between the green and blue layers. The perpendicular and lateral confinement of the exciton generation to regions of molecular-scale dimensions revealed by this study demonstrate the necessity of molecular-scale instead of conventional continuum simulation."
985,Single-ion BAB triblock copolymers as highly efficient electrolytes for lithium-metal batteries,2013-03-31,"Electrochemical energy storage is one of the main societal challenges of this century. The performances of classical lithium-ion technology based on liquid electrolytes have made great advances in the past two decades, but the intrinsic instability of liquid electrolytes results in safety issues. Solid polymer electrolytes would be a perfect solution to those safety issues, miniaturization and enhancement of energy density. However, as in liquids, the fraction of charge carried by lithium ions is small (<20%), limiting the power performances. Solid polymer electrolytes operate at 80 °C, resulting in poor mechanical properties and a limited electrochemical stability window. Here we describe a multifunctional single-ion polymer electrolyte based on polyanionic block copolymers comprising polystyrene segments. It overcomes most of the above limitations, with a lithium-ion transport number close to unity, excellent mechanical properties and an electrochemical stability window spanning 5 V versus Li+/Li. A prototype battery using this polyelectrolyte outperforms a conventional battery based on a polymer electrolyte."
986,Metre-long cell-laden microfibres exhibit tissue morphologies and functions,2013-03-31,"Artificial reconstruction of fibre-shaped cellular constructs could greatly contribute to tissue assembly in vitro. Here we show that, by using a microfluidic device with double-coaxial laminar flow, metre-long core–shell hydrogel microfibres encapsulating ECM proteins and differentiated cells or somatic stem cells can be fabricated, and that the microfibres reconstitute intrinsic morphologies and functions of living tissues. We also show that these functional fibres can be assembled, by weaving and reeling, into macroscopic cellular structures with various spatial patterns. Moreover, fibres encapsulating primary pancreatic islet cells and transplanted through a microcatheter into the subrenal capsular space of diabetic mice normalized blood glucose concentrations for about two weeks. These microfibres may find use as templates for the reconstruction of fibre-shaped functional tissues that mimic muscle fibres, blood vessels or nerve networks in vivo."
987,Optical excitation of Josephson plasma solitons in a cuprate superconductor,2013-03-24,"Josephson plasma waves are linear electromagnetic modes that propagate along the planes of cuprate superconductors, sustained by interlayer tunnelling supercurrents. For strong electromagnetic fields, as the supercurrents approach the critical value, the electrodynamics become highly nonlinear. Josephson plasma solitons (JPSs) are breather excitations predicted in this regime, bound vortex–antivortex pairs that propagate coherently without dispersion. We experimentally demonstrate the excitation of a JPS in La1.84Sr0.16CuO4, using intense narrowband radiation from an infrared free-electron laser tuned to the 2-THz Josephson plasma resonance. The JPS becomes observable as it causes a transparency window in the opaque spectral region immediately below the plasma resonance. Optical control of magnetic-flux-carrying solitons may lead to new applications in terahertz-frequency plasmonics, in information storage and transport and in the manipulation of high-Tc superconductivity."
988,A molecular design principle of lyotropic liquid-crystalline conjugated polymers with directed alignment capability for plastic electronics,2013-03-24,"Conjugated polymers with a one-dimensional p-orbital overlap exhibit optoelectronic anisotropy. Their unique anisotropic properties can be fully realized in device applications only when the conjugated chains are aligned. Here, we report a molecular design principle of conjugated polymers to achieve concentration-regulated chain planarization, self-assembly, liquid-crystal-like good mobility and non-interdigitated side chains. As a consequence of these intra- and intermolecular attributes, chain alignment along an applied flow field occurs. This liquid-crystalline conjugated polymer was realized by incorporating intramolecular sulphur–fluorine interactions and bulky side chains linked to a tetrahedral carbon having a large form factor. By optimizing the polymer concentration and the flow field, we could achieve a high dichroic ratio of 16.67 in emission from conducting conjugated polymer films. Two-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction was performed to analyse a well-defined conjugated polymer alignment. Thin-film transistors built on highly aligned conjugated polymer films showed more than three orders of magnitude faster carrier mobility along the conjugated polymer alignment direction than the perpendicular direction."
989,Degradation-mediated cellular traction directs stem cell fate in covalently crosslinked three-dimensional hydrogels,2013-03-24,"Although cell–matrix adhesive interactions are known to regulate stem cell differentiation, the underlying mechanisms, in particular for direct three-dimensional encapsulation within hydrogels, are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that in covalently crosslinked hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels, the differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) is directed by the generation of degradation-mediated cellular traction, independently of cell morphology or matrix mechanics. hMSCs within HA hydrogels of equivalent elastic moduli that permit (restrict) cell-mediated degradation exhibited high (low) degrees of cell spreading and high (low) tractions, and favoured osteogenesis (adipogenesis). Moreover, switching the permissive hydrogel to a restrictive state through delayed secondary crosslinking reduced further hydrogel degradation, suppressed traction, and caused a switch from osteogenesis to adipogenesis in the absence of changes to the extended cellular morphology. Furthermore, inhibiting tension-mediated signalling in the permissive environment mirrored the effects of delayed secondary crosslinking, whereas upregulating tension induced osteogenesis even in the restrictive environment."
990,Revisiting the δ-phase of poly(vinylidene fluoride) for solution-processed ferroelectric thin films,2013-03-17,"Ferroelectric poly(vinylidene-fluoride) (PVDF) has, in the past, been proposed as an ideal candidate for data storage applications as it exhibits a bistable, remanent, polarization that can repeatedly be switched by an electric field. However, fabrication of smooth ferroelectric PVDF thin films, as required for microelectronic applications, is a long-standing problem. At present, the copolymer of PVDF with trifluoroethylene P(VDF–TrFE) is used, but the stack integrity and the limited thermal stability of its remanent polarization hamper large-scale integration. Here we show that smooth neat PVDF films can be made at elevated substrate temperature. On applying a short electrical pulse the ferroelectric polar δ-phase is formed, an overlooked polymorph of PVDF proposed 30 years ago, but never experimentally verified. The remanent polarization and coercive field are comparable to those of the copolymer. The enhanced thermal stability of the polarization is directly related to the high Curie temperature, whereas the ferroelectric properties are related to the molecular packing as derived from the refined crystal structure. The replacement of P(VDF–TrFE) by the commodity polymer PVDF may boost large-scale industrial applications."
991,Tailoring and imaging the plasmonic local density of states in crystalline nanoprisms,2013-03-17,"Surface plasmon (SP) technologies exploit the spectral and spatial properties of collective electronic oscillations in noble metals placed in an incident optical field. Yet the SP local density of states (LDOS), which rule the energy transducing phenomena between the SP and the electromagnetic field, is much less exploited. Here, we use two-photon luminescence (TPL) microscopy to reveal the SP-LDOS in thin single-crystalline triangular gold nanoprisms produced by a quantitative one-pot synthesis at room temperature. Variations of the polarization and the wavelength of the incident light redistribute the TPL intensity into two-dimensional plasmonic resonator patterns that are faithfully reproduced by theoretical simulations. We demonstrate that experimental TPL maps can be considered as the convolution of the SP-LDOS with the diffraction-limited Gaussian light beam. Finally, the SP modal distribution is tuned by the spatial coupling of nanoprisms, thus allowing a new modal design of plasmonic information processing devices."
992,Stacked topological insulator built from bismuth-based graphene sheet analogues,2013-03-10,"Commonly, materials are classified as either electrical conductors or insulators. The theoretical discovery of topological insulators has fundamentally challenged this dichotomy. In a topological insulator, the spin–orbit interaction generates a non-trivial topology of the electronic band structure dictating that its bulk is perfectly insulating, whereas its surface is fully conducting. The first topological insulator candidate material put forward—graphene—is of limited practical use because its weak spin–orbit interactions produce a bandgap of ~ 0.01 K. Recent reexaminations of Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, however, have firmly categorized these materials as strong three-dimensional topological insulators. We have synthesized the first bulk material belonging to an entirely different, weak, topological class, built from stacks of two-dimensional topological insulators: Bi14Rh3I9. Its Bi–Rh sheets are graphene analogues, but with a honeycomb net composed of RhBi8 cubes rather than carbon atoms. The strong bismuth-related spin–orbit interaction renders each graphene-like layer a topological insulator with a 2,400 K bandgap."
993,High-resolution three-photon biomedical imaging using doped ZnS nanocrystals,2013-02-17,"Three-photon excitation is a process that occurs when three photons are simultaneously absorbed within a luminophore for photo-excitation through virtual states. Although the imaging application of this process was proposed decades ago, three-photon biomedical imaging has not been realized yet owing to its intrinsic low quantum efficiency. We herein report on high-resolution in vitro and in vivo imaging by combining three-photon excitation of ZnS nanocrystals and visible emission from Mn2+ dopants. The large three-photon cross-section of the nanocrystals enabled targeted cellular imaging under high spatial resolution, approaching the theoretical limit of three-photon excitation. Owing to the enhanced Stokes shift achieved through nanocrystal doping, the three-photon process was successfully applied to high-resolution in vivo tumour-targeted imaging. Furthermore, the biocompatibility of ZnS nanocrystals offers great potential for clinical applications of three-photon imaging."
994,Exploring electrolyte organization in supercapacitor electrodes with solid-state NMR,2013-02-17,"Supercapacitors are electrochemical energy-storage devices that exploit the electrostatic interaction between high-surface-area nanoporous electrodes and electrolyte ions. Insight into the molecular mechanisms at work inside supercapacitor carbon electrodes is obtained with 13C and 11B ex situ magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR). In activated carbons soaked with an electrolyte solution, two distinct adsorption sites are detected by NMR, both undergoing chemical exchange with the free electrolyte molecules. On charging, anions are substituted by cations in the negative carbon electrode and cations by anions in the positive electrode, and their proportions in each electrode are quantified by NMR. Moreover, acetonitrile molecules are expelled from the adsorption sites at the negative electrode alone. Two nanoporous carbon materials were tested, with different nanotexture orders (using Raman and 13C MAS-NMR spectroscopies), and the more disordered carbon shows a better capacitance and a better tolerance to high voltages."
995,Compact high-quality CdSe–CdS core–shell nanocrystals with narrow emission linewidths and suppressed blinking,2013-02-03,"High particle uniformity, high photoluminescence quantum yields, narrow and symmetric emission spectral lineshapes and minimal single-dot emission intermittency (known as blinking) have been recognized as universal requirements for the successful use of colloidal quantum dots in nearly all optical applications. However, synthesizing samples that simultaneously meet all these four criteria has proven challenging. Here, we report the synthesis of such high-quality CdSe–CdS core–shell quantum dots in an optimized process that maintains a slow growth rate of the shell through the use of octanethiol and cadmium oleate as precursors. In contrast with previous observations, single-dot blinking is significantly suppressed with only a relatively thin shell. Furthermore, we demonstrate the elimination of the ensemble luminescence photodarkening that is an intrinsic consequence of quantum dot blinking statistical ageing. Furthermore, the small size and high photoluminescence quantum yields of these novel quantum dots render them superior in vivo imaging agents compared with conventional quantum dots. We anticipate these quantum dots will also result in significant improvement in the performance of quantum dots in other applications such as solid-state lighting and illumination."
996,Self-assembled quantum dots in a nanowire system for quantum photonics,2013-02-03,"Quantum dots embedded within nanowires represent one of the most promising technologies for applications in quantum photonics. Whereas the top-down fabrication of such structures remains a technological challenge, their bottom-up fabrication through self-assembly is a potentially more powerful strategy. However, present approaches often yield quantum dots with large optical linewidths, making reproducibility of their physical properties difficult. We present a versatile quantum-dot-in-nanowire system that reproducibly self-assembles in core–shell GaAs/AlGaAs nanowires. The quantum dots form at the apex of a GaAs/AlGaAs interface, are highly stable, and can be positioned with nanometre precision relative to the nanowire centre. Unusually, their emission is blue-shifted relative to the lowest energy continuum states of the GaAs core. Large-scale electronic structure calculations show that the origin of the optical transitions lies in quantum confinement due to Al-rich barriers. By emitting in the red and self-assembling on silicon substrates, these quantum dots could therefore become building blocks for solid-state lighting devices and third-generation solar cells."
997,Ultrafast spin transport as key to femtosecond demagnetization,2013-01-27,"Irradiating a ferromagnet with a femtosecond laser pulse is known to induce an ultrafast demagnetization within a few hundred femtoseconds. Here we demonstrate that direct laser irradiation is in fact not essential for ultrafast demagnetization, and that electron cascades caused by hot electron currents accomplish it very efficiently. We optically excite a Au/Ni layered structure in which the 30 nm Au capping layer absorbs the incident laser pump pulse and subsequently use the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism technique to probe the femtosecond demagnetization of the adjacent 15 nm Ni layer. A demagnetization effect corresponding to the scenario in which the laser directly excites the Ni film is observed, but with a slight temporal delay. We explain this unexpected observation by means of the demagnetizing effect of a superdiffusive current of non-equilibrium, non-spin-polarized electrons generated in the Au layer."
998,Non-invasive determination of the complete elastic moduli of spider silks,2013-01-27,"Spider silks possess nature’s most exceptional mechanical properties, with unrivalled extensibility and high tensile strength. Unfortunately, our understanding of silks is limited because the complete elastic response has never been measured—leaving a stark lack of essential fundamental information. Using non-invasive, non-destructive Brillouin light scattering, we obtain the entire stiffness tensors (revealing negative Poisson’s ratios), refractive indices, and longitudinal and transverse sound velocities for major and minor ampullate spider silks: Argiope aurantia, Latrodectus hesperus, Nephila clavipes, Peucetia viridans. These results completely quantify the linear elastic response for all possible deformation modes, information unobtainable with traditional stress–strain tests. For completeness, we apply the principles of Brillouin imaging to spatially map the elastic stiffnesses on a spider web without deforming or disrupting the web in a non-invasive, non-contact measurement, finding variation among discrete fibres, junctions and glue spots. Finally, we provide the stiffness changes that occur with supercontraction."
999,Nanostructured high-strength molybdenum alloys with unprecedented tensile ductility,2013-01-27,"The high-temperature stability and mechanical properties of refractory molybdenum alloys are highly desirable for a wide range of critical applications. However, a long-standing problem for these alloys is that they suffer from low ductility and limited formability. Here we report a nanostructuring strategy that achieves Mo alloys with yield strength over 800 MPa and tensile elongation as large as ~ 40% at room temperature. The processing route involves a molecular-level liquid–liquid mixing/doping technique that leads to an optimal microstructure of submicrometre grains with nanometric oxide particles uniformly distributed in the grain interior. Our approach can be readily adapted to large-scale industrial production of ductile Mo alloys that can be extensively processed and shaped at low temperatures. The architecture engineered into such multicomponent alloys offers a general pathway for manufacturing dispersion-strengthened materials with both high strength and ductility."
1000,Polymer multilayer tattooing for enhanced DNA vaccination,2013-01-27,"DNA vaccines have many potential benefits but have failed to generate robust immune responses in humans. Recently, methods such as in vivo electroporation have demonstrated improved performance, but an optimal strategy for safe, reproducible, and pain-free DNA vaccination remains elusive. Here we report an approach for rapid implantation of vaccine-loaded polymer films carrying DNA, immune-stimulatory RNA, and biodegradable polycations into the immune-cell-rich epidermis, using microneedles coated with releasable polyelectrolyte multilayers. Films transferred into the skin following brief microneedle application promoted local transfection and controlled the persistence of DNA and adjuvants in the skin from days to weeks, with kinetics determined by the film composition. These ‘multilayer tattoo’ DNA vaccines induced immune responses against a model HIV antigen comparable to electroporation in mice, enhanced memory T-cell generation, and elicited 140-fold higher gene expression in non-human primate skin than intradermal DNA injection, indicating the potential of this strategy for enhancing DNA vaccination."
1001,MRI-detectable pH nanosensors incorporated into hydrogels for ,2013-01-27,"Biocompatible nanomaterials and hydrogels have become an important tool for improving cell-based therapies by promoting cell survival and protecting cell transplants from immune rejection. Although their potential benefit has been widely evaluated, at present it is not possible to determine, in vivo, if and how long cells remain viable following their administration without the use of a reporter gene. Here, we report a pH-nanosensor-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that can monitor cell death in vivo non-invasively. We demonstrate that specific MRI parameters that change on cell death of microencapsulated hepatocytes are associated with the measured bioluminescence imaging radiance. Moreover, the readout from this pH-sensitive nanosensor can be directly co-registered with high-resolution anatomical images. All of the components of these nanosensors are clinical grade and hence this approach should be a translatable and universal modification of hydrogels."
1002,Site- and orbital-dependent charge donation and spin manipulation in electron-doped metal phthalocyanines,2013-01-20,"Chemical doping offers promise as a means of tailoring the electrical characteristics of organic molecular compounds. However, unlike for inorganic semiconductors used in electronics applications, controlling the influence of dopants in molecular complexes is complicated by the presence of multiple doping sites, electron acceptor levels, and intramolecular correlation effects. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to analyse the position of individual Li dopants within Cu- and Ni-phthalocyanine molecules in contact with a metal substrate, and probe the charge transfer process with unprecedented spatial resolution. We show that individual phthalocyanine molecules can host at least three distinct stable doping sites and up to six dopant atoms, and that the ligand and metal orbitals can be selectively charged by modifying the configuration of the Li complexes. Li manipulation reveals that charge transfer is determined solely by dopants embedded in the molecules, whereas the magnitude of the conductance gap is sensitive to the molecule–dopant separation. As a result of the strong spin–charge correlation in confined molecular orbitals, alkali atoms provide an effective way for tuning the molecular spin without resorting to magnetic dopants."
1003,The cytoplasm of living cells behaves as a poroelastic material,2013-01-06,"The cytoplasm is the largest part of the cell by volume and hence its rheology sets the rate at which cellular shape changes can occur. Recent experimental evidence suggests that cytoplasmic rheology can be described by a poroelastic model, in which the cytoplasm is treated as a biphasic material consisting of a porous elastic solid meshwork (cytoskeleton, organelles, macromolecules) bathed in an interstitial fluid (cytosol). In this picture, the rate of cellular deformation is limited by the rate at which intracellular water can redistribute within the cytoplasm. However, direct supporting evidence for the model is lacking. Here we directly validate the poroelastic model to explain cellular rheology at short timescales using microindentation tests in conjunction with mechanical, chemical and genetic treatments. Our results show that water redistribution through the solid phase of the cytoplasm (cytoskeleton and macromolecular crowders) plays a fundamental role in setting cellular rheology at short timescales."
1004,Ultrastable glasses from ,2013-01-06,"Glasses are generally prepared by cooling from the liquid phase, and their properties depend on their thermal history. Recent experiments indicate that glasses prepared by vapour deposition onto a substrate can exhibit remarkable stability, and might correspond to equilibrium states that could hitherto be reached only by glasses aged for thousands of years. Here we create ultrastable glasses by means of a computer-simulation process that mimics physical vapour deposition. These stable glasses have, far below the conventional glass-transition temperature, the properties expected for the equilibrium supercooled liquid state, and optimal stability is attained when deposition occurs at the Kauzmann temperature. We also show that the glasses’ extraordinary stability is associated with distinct structural motifs, in particular the abundance of regular Voronoi polyhedra and the relative lack of irregular polyhedra."
1005,Layer thickness dependence of the current-induced effective field vector in Ta|CoFeB|MgO,2012-12-23,"Current-induced effective magnetic fields can provide efficient ways of electrically manipulating the magnetization of ultrathin magnetic heterostructures. Two effects, known as the Rashba spin orbit field and the spin Hall spin torque, have been reported to be responsible for the generation of the effective field. However, a quantitative understanding of the effective field, including its direction with respect to the current flow, is lacking. Here we describe vector measurements of the current-induced effective field in Ta|CoFeB|MgO heterostructrures. The effective field exhibits a significant dependence on the Ta and CoFeB layer thicknesses. In particular, a 1 nm thickness variation of the Ta layer can change the magnitude of the effective field by nearly two orders of magnitude. Moreover, its sign changes when the Ta layer thickness is reduced, indicating that there are two competing effects contributing to it. Our results illustrate that the presence of atomically thin metals can profoundly change the landscape for controlling magnetic moments in magnetic heterostructures electrically."
1006,Vertically stacked multi-heterostructures of layered materials for logic transistors and complementary inverters,2012-12-16,"Graphene has attracted considerable interest for future electronics, but the absence of a bandgap limits its direct applicability in transistors and logic devices. Recently, other layered materials such as molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) have been investigated to address this challenge. Here, we report the vertical integration of multi-heterostructures of layered materials for the fabrication of a new generation of vertical field-effect transistors (VFETs) with a room temperature on–off ratio > 103 and a high current density of up to 5,000 A cm−2. An n-channel VFET is created by sandwiching few-layer MoS2 as the semiconducting channel between a monolayer graphene sheet and a metal thin film. This approach offers a general strategy for the vertical integration of p- and n-channel transistors for high-performance logic applications. As an example, we demonstrate a complementary inverter with a larger-than-unity voltage gain by vertically stacking graphene, Bi2Sr2Co2O8 (p-channel), graphene, MoS2 (n-channel) and a metal thin film in sequence. The ability to simultaneously achieve a high on–off ratio, a high current density and a logic function in such vertically stacked multi-heterostructures can open up possibilities for three-dimensional integration in future electronics."
1007,Photonic topological insulators,2012-12-16,"Recent progress in understanding the topological properties of condensed matter has led to the discovery of time-reversal-invariant topological insulators. A remarkable and useful property of these materials is that they support unidirectional spin-polarized propagation at their surfaces. Unfortunately topological insulators are rare among solid-state materials. Using suitably designed electromagnetic media (metamaterials) we theoretically demonstrate a photonic analogue of a topological insulator. We show that metacrystals—superlattices of metamaterials with judiciously designed properties—provide a platform for designing topologically non-trivial photonic states, similar to those that have been identified for condensed-matter topological insulators. The interfaces of the metacrystals support helical edge states that exhibit spin-polarized one-way propagation of photons, robust against disorder. Our results demonstrate the possibility of attaining one-way photon transport without application of external magnetic fields or breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Such spin-polarized one-way transport enables exotic spin-cloaked photon sources that do not obscure each other."
1008,"Real-time quantitative imaging of failure events in materials under load at temperatures above 1,600 °C",2012-12-09,"Ceramic matrix composites are the emerging material of choice for structures that will see temperatures above ~1,500 °C in hostile environments, as for example in next-generation gas turbines and hypersonic-flight applications. The safe operation of applications depends on how small cracks forming inside the material are restrained by its microstructure. As with natural tissue such as bone and seashells, the tailored microstructural complexity of ceramic matrix composites imparts them with mechanical toughness, which is essential to avoiding failure. Yet gathering three-dimensional observations of damage evolution in extreme environments has been a challenge. Using synchrotron X-ray computed microtomography, we have fully resolved sequences of microcrack damage as cracks grow under load at temperatures up to 1,750 °C. Our observations are key ingredients for the high-fidelity simulations used to compute failure risks under extreme operating conditions."
1009,Hot charge-transfer excitons set the time limit for charge separation at donor/acceptor interfaces in organic photovoltaics,2012-12-09,"Photocurrent generation in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) relies on the dissociation of excitons into free electrons and holes at donor/acceptor heterointerfaces. The low dielectric constant of organic semiconductors leads to strong Coulomb interactions between electron–hole pairs that should in principle oppose the generation of free charges. The exact mechanism by which electrons and holes overcome this Coulomb trapping is still unsolved, but increasing evidence points to the critical role of hot charge-transfer (CT) excitons in assisting this process. Here we provide a real-time view of hot CT exciton formation and relaxation using femtosecond nonlinear optical spectroscopies and non-adiabatic mixed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations in the phthalocyanine–fullerene model OPV system. For initial excitation on phthalocyanine, hot CT excitons are formed in 10−13 s, followed by relaxation to lower energies and shorter electron–hole distances on a 10−12 s timescale. This hot CT exciton cooling process and collapse of charge separation sets the fundamental time limit for competitive charge separation channels that lead to efficient photocurrent generation."
1010,Transition from slow Abrikosov to fast moving Josephson vortices in iron pnictide superconductors,2012-11-25,"Iron pnictides are layered high Tc superconductors with moderate material anisotropy and thus Abrikosov vortices are expected in the mixed state. Yet, we have discovered a distinct change in the nature of the vortices from Abrikosov-like to Josephson-like in the pnictide superconductor SmFeAs(O,F) with Tc~48–50 K on cooling below a temperature T*~41–42 K, despite its moderate electronic anisotropy γ~4–6. This transition is hallmarked by a sharp drop in the critical current and accordingly a jump in the flux-flow voltage in a magnetic field precisely aligned along the FeAs layers, indicative of highly mobile vortices. T* coincides well with the temperature where the coherence length ξc perpendicular to the layers matches half of the FeAs-layer spacing. For fields slightly out-of-plane (> 0.1°– 0.15°) the vortices are completely immobilized as well-pinned Abrikosov segments are introduced when the vortex crosses the FeAs layers. We interpret these findings as a transition from well-pinned, slow moving Abrikosov vortices at high temperatures to weakly pinned, fast flowing Josephson vortices at low temperatures. This vortex dynamics could become technologically relevant as superconducting applications will always operate deep in the Josephson regime."
1011,Emergence of superconductivity from the dynamically heterogeneous insulating state in La,2012-11-18,"A central issue for copper oxides is the nature of the insulating ground state at low carrier densities and the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity from that state with doping. Even though this superconductor–insulator transition (SIT) is a zero-temperature transition, measurements are not usually carried out at low temperatures. Here we use magnetoresistance to probe both the insulating state at very low temperatures and the presence of superconducting fluctuations in La2−xSrxCuO4 films, for doping levels that range from the insulator to the superconductor (x = 0.03–0.08). We observe that the charge glass behaviour, characteristic of the insulating state, is suppressed with doping, but it coexists with superconducting fluctuations that emerge already on the insulating side of the SIT. The unexpected quenching of the superconducting fluctuations by the competing charge order at low temperatures provides a new perspective on the mechanism for the SIT."
1012,Self-assembled nanoparticle arrays for multiphase trace analyte detection,2012-11-18,"Nanoplasmonic structures designed for trace analyte detection using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy typically require sophisticated nanofabrication techniques. An alternative to fabricating such substrates is to rely on self-assembly of nanoparticles into close-packed arrays at liquid/liquid or liquid/air interfaces. The density of the arrays can be controlled by modifying the nanoparticle functionality, pH of the solution and salt concentration. Importantly, these arrays are robust, self-healing, reproducible and extremely easy to handle. Here, we report on the use of such platforms formed by Au nanoparticles for the detection of multi-analytes from the aqueous, organic or air phases. The interfacial area of the Au array in our system is ≈25 mm2 and can be made smaller, making this platform ideal for small-volume samples, low concentrations and trace analytes. Importantly, the ease of assembly and rapid detection make this platform ideal for in-the-field sample testing of toxins, explosives, narcotics or other hazardous chemicals."
1013,Tailored exciton diffusion in organic photovoltaic cells for enhanced power conversion efficiency,2012-11-11,"Photoconversion in planar-heterojunction organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) is limited by a short exciton diffusion length (LD) that restricts migration to the dissociating electron donor/acceptor interface. Consequently, bulk heterojunctions are often used to realize high efficiency as these structures reduce the distance an exciton must travel to be dissociated. Here, we present an alternative approach that seeks to directly engineer LD by optimizing the intermolecular separation and consequently, the photophysical parameters responsible for excitonic energy transfer. By diluting the electron donor boron subphthalocyanine chloride into a wide-energy-gap host material, we optimize the degree of interaction between donor molecules and observe a ~50% increase in LD. Using this approach, we construct planar-heterojunction OPVs with a power conversion efficiency of (4.4 ± 0.3)%, > 30% larger than the case of optimized devices containing an undiluted donor layer. The underlying correlation between LD and the degree of molecular interaction has wide implications for the design of both OPV active materials and device architectures."
1014,Atomic mechanism and prediction of hydrogen embrittlement in iron,2012-11-11,"Hydrogen embrittlement in metals has posed a serious obstacle to designing strong and reliable structural materials for many decades, and predictive physical mechanisms still do not exist. Here, a new H embrittlement mechanism operating at the atomic scale in α-iron is demonstrated. Direct molecular dynamics simulations reveal a ductile-to-brittle transition caused by the suppression of dislocation emission at the crack tip due to aggregation of H, which then permits brittle-cleavage failure followed by slow crack growth. The atomistic embrittlement mechanism is then connected to material states and loading conditions through a kinetic model for H delivery to the crack-tip region. Parameter-free predictions of embrittlement thresholds in Fe-based steels over a range of H concentrations, mechanical loading rates and H diffusion rates are found to be in excellent agreement with experiments. This work provides a mechanistic, predictive framework for interpreting experiments, designing structural components and guiding the design of embrittlement-resistant materials."
1015,Ultrasmall implantable composite microelectrodes with bioactive surfaces for chronic neural interfaces,2012-11-11,"Implantable neural microelectrodes that can record extracellular biopotentials from small, targeted groups of neurons are critical for neuroscience research and emerging clinical applications including brain-controlled prosthetic devices. The crucial material-dependent problem is developing microelectrodes that record neural activity from the same neurons for years with high fidelity and reliability. Here, we report the development of an integrated composite electrode consisting of a carbon-fibre core, a poly(p-xylylene)-based thin-film coating that acts as a dielectric barrier and that is functionalized to control intrinsic biological processes, and a poly(thiophene)-based recording pad. The resulting implants are an order of magnitude smaller than traditional recording electrodes, and more mechanically compliant with brain tissue. They were found to elicit much reduced chronic reactive tissue responses and enabled single-neuron recording in acute and early chronic experiments in rats. This technology, taking advantage of new composites, makes possible highly selective and stealthy neural interface devices towards realizing long-lasting implants."
1016,P2-Na,2012-11-11,"Layered oxides are the subject of intense studies either for their properties as electrode materials for high-energy batteries or for their original physical properties due to the strong electronic correlations resulting from their unique structure. Here we present the detailed phase diagram of the layered P2-NaxVO2 system determined from electrochemical intercalation/deintercalation in sodium batteries and in situ X-ray diffraction experiments. It shows that four main single-phase domains exist within the 0.5≤x≤0.9 range. During the sodium deintercalation (intercalation), they differ from one another in the sodium/vacancy ordering between the VO2 slabs, which leads to commensurable or incommensurable superstructures. The electrochemical curve reveals that three peculiar compositions exhibit special structures for x = 1/2, 5/8 and 2/3. The detailed structural characterization of the P2-Na1/2VO2 phase shows that the Na+ ions are perfectly ordered to minimize Na+/Na+ electrostatic repulsions. Within the VO2 layers, the vanadium ions form pseudo-trimers with very short V–V distances (two at 2.581 Å and one at 2.687 Å). This original distribution leads to a peculiar magnetic behaviour with a low magnetic susceptibility and an unexpected low Curie constant. This phase also presents a first-order structural transition above room temperature accompanied by magnetic and electronic transitions. This work opens up a new research domain in the field of strongly electron-correlated materials. From the electrochemical point of view this system may be at the origin of an entire material family optimized by cationic substitutions."
1017,Mesostructured thin films as electrocatalysts with tunable composition and surface morphology,2012-11-11,"Among the most challenging issues in technologies for electrochemical energy conversion are the insufficient activity of the catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction, catalyst degradation and carbon-support corrosion. In an effort to address these barriers, we aimed towards carbon-free multi/bimetallic materials in the form of mesostructured thin films with tailored physical properties. We present here a new class of metallic materials with tunable near-surface composition, morphology and structure that have led to greatly improved affinity for the electrochemical reduction of oxygen. The level of activity for the oxygen reduction reaction established on mesostructured thin-film catalysts exceeds the highest value reported for bulk polycrystalline Pt bimetallic alloys, and is 20-fold more active than the present state-of-the-art Pt/C nanoscale catalyst."
1018,Resonant light trapping in ultrathin films for water splitting,2012-11-11,"Semiconductor photoelectrodes for solar hydrogen production by water photoelectrolysis must employ stable, non-toxic, abundant and inexpensive visible-light absorbers. Iron oxide (α-Fe2O3) is one of few materials meeting these requirements, but its poor transport properties present challenges for efficient charge-carrier generation, separation, collection and injection. Here we show that these challenges can be addressed by means of resonant light trapping in ultrathin films designed as optical cavities. Interference between forward- and backward-propagating waves enhances the light absorption in quarter-wave or, in some cases, deeper subwavelength films, amplifying the intensity close to the surface wherein photogenerated minority charge carriers (holes) can reach the surface and oxidize water before recombination takes place. Combining this effect with photon retrapping schemes, such as using V-shaped cells, provides efficient light harvesting in ultrathin films of high internal quantum efficiency, overcoming the trade-off between light absorption and charge collection. A water photo-oxidation current density of 4 mA cm−2 was achieved using a V-shaped cell comprising ∼ 26-nm-thick Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 films on back-reflector substrates coated with silver–gold alloy."
1019,Structurally ordered intermetallic platinum–cobalt core–shell nanoparticles with enhanced activity and stability as oxygen reduction electrocatalysts,2012-10-28,"To enhance and optimize nanocatalyst performance and durability for the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel-cell applications, we look beyond Pt–metal disordered alloys and describe a new class of Pt–Co nanocatalysts composed of ordered Pt3Co intermetallic cores with a 2–3 atomic-layer-thick platinum shell. These nanocatalysts exhibited over 200% increase in mass activity and over 300% increase in specific activity when compared with the disordered Pt3Co alloy nanoparticles as well as Pt/C. So far, this mass activity for the oxygen reduction reaction is the highest among the Pt–Co systems reported in the literature under similar testing conditions. Stability tests showed a minimal loss of activity after 5,000 potential cycles and the ordered core–shell structure was maintained virtually intact, as established by atomic-scale elemental mapping. The high activity and stability are attributed to the Pt-rich shell and the stable intermetallic Pt3Co core arrangement. These ordered nanoparticles provide a new direction for catalyst performance optimization for next-generation fuel cells."
1020,Autonomous motors of a metal–organic framework powered by reorganization of self-assembled peptides at interfaces,2012-10-28,"A variety of microsystems have been developed that harness energy and convert it to mechanical motion. Here we have developed new autonomous biochemical motors by integrating a metal–organic framework (MOF) and self-assembling peptides. The MOF is applied as an energy-storing cell that assembles peptides inside nanoscale pores of the coordination framework. The nature of peptides enables their assemblies to be reconfigured at the water/MOF interface, and thus converted to fuel energy. Reorganization of hydrophobic peptides can create a large surface-tension gradient around the MOF that can efficiently power its translational motion. As a comparison, the velocity normalized by volume for the diphenylalanine–MOF particle is faster and the kinetic energy per unit mass of fuel is more than twice as great as that for previous gel motor systems. This demonstration opens the route towards new applications of MOFs and reconfigurable molecular self-assembly, possibly evolving into a smart autonomous motor capable of mimicking swimming bacteria and, with integrated recognition units, harvesting target chemicals."
1021,Giant and reversible extrinsic magnetocaloric effects in La,2012-10-28,"Large thermal changes driven by a magnetic field have been proposed for environmentally friendly energy-efficient refrigeration, but only a few materials that suffer hysteresis show these giant magnetocaloric effects. Here we create giant and reversible extrinsic magnetocaloric effects in epitaxial films of the ferromagnetic manganite La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 using strain-mediated feedback from BaTiO3 substrates near a first-order structural phase transition. Our findings should inspire the discovery of giant magnetocaloric effects in a wide range of magnetic materials, and the parallel development of nanostructured bulk samples for practical applications."
1022,Singular characteristics and unique chemical bond activation mechanisms of photocatalytic reactions on plasmonic nanostructures,2012-10-28,"The field of heterogeneous photocatalysis has almost exclusively focused on semiconductor photocatalysts. Herein, we show that plasmonic metallic nanostructures represent a new family of photocatalysts. We demonstrate that these photocatalysts exhibit fundamentally different behaviour compared with semiconductors. First, we show that photocatalytic reaction rates on excited plasmonic metallic nanostructures exhibit a super-linear power law dependence on light intensity (rate ∝intensityn, with n > 1), at significantly lower intensity than required for super-linear behaviour on extended metal surfaces. We also demonstrate that, in sharp contrast to semiconductor photocatalysts, photocatalytic quantum efficiencies on plasmonic metallic nanostructures increase with light intensity and operating temperature. These unique characteristics of plasmonic metallic nanostructures suggest that this new family of photocatalysts could prove useful for many heterogeneous catalytic processes that cannot be activated using conventional thermal processes on metals or photocatalytic processes on semiconductors."
1023,Design of zeolite by inverse sigma transformation,2012-10-21,"Although the search for new zeolites has traditionally been based on trial and error, more rational methods are now available. The theoretical concept of inverse σ transformation of a zeolite framework to generate a new structure by removal of a layer of framework atoms and contraction has for the first time been achieved experimentally. The reactivity of framework germanium atoms in strong mineral acid was exploited to selectively remove germanium-containing four-ring units from an UTL type germanosilicate zeolite. Annealing of the leached framework through calcination led to the new all-silica COK-14 zeolite with intersecting 12- and 10-membered ring channel systems. An intermediate stage of this inverse σ transformation with dislodged germanate four-rings still residing in the pores could be demonstrated. Inverse σ transformation involving elimination of germanium-containing structural units opens perspectives for the synthesis of many more zeolites."
1024,Long-range interlayer alignment of intralayer domains in stacked lipid bilayers,2012-10-21,"Liquid-crystalline phases of stacked lipid bilayers represent a pervasive motif in biomolecular assemblies. Here we report that, in addition to the usual smectic order, multicomponent multilayer membranes can exhibit columnar order arising from the coupling of two-dimensional intralayer phase separation and interlayer smectic ordering. This coupling propagates across hundreds of membrane lamellae, producing long-range alignment of phase-separated domains. Quantitative analysis of real-time dynamical experiments reveals that there is an interplay between intralayer domain growth and interlayer coupling, suggesting the existence of cooperative multilayer epitaxy. We postulate that such long-range epitaxy is solvent-assisted, and that it originates from the surface tension associated with differences in the network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules at the hydrated interfaces between the domains and the surrounding phase. Our findings might inspire the development of self-assembly-based strategies for the long-range alignment of functional lipid domains."
1025,Tuning the catalytic activity of Ag(110)-supported Fe phthalocyanine in the oxygen reduction reaction,2012-10-21,"A careful choice of the surface coverage of iron phthalocyanine (FePc) on Ag (110) around the single monolayer allows us to drive with high precision both the long-range supramolecular arrangement and the local adsorption geometry of FePc molecules on the given surface. We show that this opens up the possibility of sharply switching the catalytic activity of FePc in the oxygen reduction reaction and contextual surface oxidation in a reproducible way. A comprehensive and detailed picture built on diverse experimental evidence from scanning tunnelling microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, coupled with density functional theory calculations, sheds new light on the nature of the catalytically active molecule–surface coordination and on the boundary conditions for its occurrence. The results are of relevance for the improvement of the catalytic efficiency of metallo-macrocycles as viable substitutes for platinum in the cathodic compartment of low-temperature fuel cells."
1026,Quantized thermal transport across contacts of rough surfaces,2012-10-21,"Heat transport across interfaces is often discussed in terms of the transmission probability of the heat-carrying phonons through the contact zone. Although interface roughness influences the true contact area and affects phonon scattering within the contact zone, its effect on nanoscale heat transport remains poorly understood. Here, we report experimental data on the pressure dependence of thermal transport across polished nanoscale contacts. The data can be quantitatively explained by a model of thermal conductance across interfaces that incorporates the effect of nanoscale roughness through the quantized thermal conductance across individual atomic-scale contacts within the contact zone."
1027,Bulk electronic structure of the dilute magnetic semiconductor Ga,2012-10-14,"A detailed understanding of the origin of the magnetism in dilute magnetic semiconductors is crucial to their development for applications. Using hard X-ray angle-resolved photoemission (HARPES) at 3.2 keV, we investigate the bulk electronic structure of the prototypical dilute magnetic semiconductor Ga0.97Mn0.03As, and the reference undoped GaAs. The data are compared to theory based on the coherent potential approximation and fully relativistic one-step-model photoemission calculations including matrix-element effects. Distinct differences are found between angle-resolved, as well as angle-integrated, valence spectra of Ga0.97Mn0.03As and GaAs, and these are in good agreement with theory. Direct observation of Mn-induced states between the GaAs valence-band maximum and the Fermi level, centred about 400 meV below this level, as well as changes throughout the full valence-level energy range, indicates that ferromagnetism in Ga1−xMnxAs must be considered to arise from both p–d exchange and double exchange, thus providing a more unifying picture of this controversial material."
1028,Role of vacancies in metal–insulator transitions of crystalline phase-change materials,2012-10-14,"The study of metal–insulator transitions (MITs) in crystalline solids is a subject of paramount importance, both from the fundamental point of view and for its relevance to the transport properties of materials. Recently, a MIT governed by disorder was observed in crystalline phase-change materials. Here we report on calculations employing density functional theory, which identify the microscopic mechanism that localizes the wavefunctions and is driving this transition. We show that, in the insulating phase, the electronic states responsible for charge transport are localized inside regions having large vacancy concentrations. The transition to the metallic state is driven by the dissolution of these vacancy clusters and the formation of ordered vacancy layers. These results provide important insights on controlling the wavefunction localization, which should help to develop conceptually new devices based on multiple resistance states."
1029,Engineering the surface structure of MoS,2012-10-07,"Controlling surface structure at the atomic scale is paramount to developing effective catalysts. For example, the edge sites of MoS2 are highly catalytically active and are thus preferred at the catalyst surface over MoS2 basal planes, which are inert. However, thermodynamics favours the presence of the basal plane, limiting the number of active sites at the surface. Herein, we engineer the surface structure of MoS2 to preferentially expose edge sites to effect improved catalysis by successfully synthesizing contiguous large-area thin films of a highly ordered double-gyroid MoS2 bicontinuous network with nanoscaled pores. The high surface curvature of this catalyst mesostructure exposes a large fraction of edge sites, which, along with its high surface area, leads to excellent activity for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This work elucidates how morphological control of materials at the nanoscale can significantly impact the surface structure at the atomic scale, enabling new opportunities for enhancing surface properties for catalysis and other important technological applications."
1030,Ultrasensitive detection of toxic cations through changes in the tunnelling current across films of striped nanoparticles,2012-09-09,"Although multiple methods have been developed to detect metal cations, only a few offer sensitivities below 1 pM, and many require complicated procedures and sophisticated equipment. Here, we describe a class of simple solid-state sensors for the ultrasensitive detection of heavy-metal cations (notably, an unprecedented attomolar limit for the detection of CH3Hg+ in both standardized solutions and environmental samples) through changes in the tunnelling current across films of nanoparticles (NPs) protected with striped monolayers of organic ligands. The sensors are also highly selective because of the ligand–shell organization of the NPs. On binding of metal cations, the electronic structure of the molecular bridges between proximal NPs changes, the tunnelling current increases and highly conductive paths ultimately percolate the entire film. The nanoscale heterogeneity of the structure of the film broadens the range of the cation-binding constants, which leads to wide sensitivity ranges (remarkably, over 18 orders of magnitude in CH3Hg+ concentration)."
1031,Macroporous nanowire nanoelectronic scaffolds for synthetic tissues,2012-08-26,"The development of three-dimensional (3D) synthetic biomaterials as structural and bioactive scaffolds is central to fields ranging from cellular biophysics to regenerative medicine. As of yet, these scaffolds cannot electrically probe the physicochemical and biological microenvironments throughout their 3D and macroporous interior, although this capability could have a marked impact in both electronics and biomaterials. Here, we address this challenge using macroporous, flexible and free-standing nanowire nanoelectronic scaffolds (nanoES), and their hybrids with synthetic or natural biomaterials. 3D macroporous nanoES mimic the structure of natural tissue scaffolds, and they were formed by self-organization of coplanar reticular networks with built-in strain and by manipulation of 2D mesh matrices. NanoES exhibited robust electronic properties and have been used alone or combined with other biomaterials as biocompatible extracellular scaffolds for 3D culture of neurons, cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, we show the integrated sensory capability of the nanoES by real-time monitoring of the local electrical activity within 3D nanoES/cardiomyocyte constructs, the response of 3D-nanoES-based neural and cardiac tissue models to drugs, and distinct pH changes inside and outside tubular vascular smooth muscle constructs."
1032,Deep-subwavelength imaging of the modal dispersion of light,2012-08-19,"Numerous optical technologies and quantum optical devices rely on the controlled coupling of a local emitter to its photonic environment, which is governed by the local density of optical states (LDOS). Although precise knowledge of the LDOS is crucial, classical optical techniques fail to measure it in all of its frequency and spatial components. Here, we use a scanning electron beam as a point source to probe the LDOS. Through angular and spectral detection of the electron-induced light emission, we spatially and spectrally resolve the light wave vector and determine the LDOS of Bloch modes in a photonic crystal membrane at an unprecedented deep-subwavelength resolution (30–40 nm) over a large spectral range. We present a first look inside photonic crystal cavities revealing subwavelength details of the resonant modes. Our results provide direct guidelines for the optimum location of emitters to control their emission, and key fundamental insights into light–matter coupling at the nanoscale."
1033,Probing oxygen vacancy concentration and homogeneity in solid-oxide fuel-cell cathode materials on the subunit-cell level,2012-08-19,"Oxygen vacancy distributions and dynamics directly control the operation of solid-oxide fuel cells and are intrinsically coupled with magnetic, electronic and transport properties of oxides. For understanding the atomistic mechanisms involved during operation of the cell it is highly desirable to know the distribution of vacancies on the unit-cell scale. Here, we develop an approach for direct mapping of oxygen vacancy concentrations based on local lattice parameter measurements by scanning transmission electron microscopy. The concept of chemical expansivity is demonstrated to be applicable on the subunit-cell level: local stoichiometry variations produce local lattice expansion that can be quantified. This approach was successfully applied to lanthanum strontium cobaltite thin films epitaxially grown on substrates of different symmetry, where polarized neutron reflectometry revealed a strong difference in magnetic properties. The different vacancy content found in the two films suggests the change in oxygen chemical potential as a source of distinct magnetic properties, opening pathways for structural tuning of the vacancy concentrations and their gradients."
1034,Atomic origins of the high catalytic activity of nanoporous gold,2012-08-12,"Distinct from inert bulk gold, nanoparticulate gold has been found to possess remarkable catalytic activity towards oxidation reactions. The catalytic performance of nanoparticulate gold strongly depends on size and support, and catalytic activity usually cannot be observed at characteristic sizes larger than 5 nm. Interestingly, significant catalytic activity can be retained in dealloyed nanoporous gold (NPG) even when its feature lengths are larger than 30 nm. Here we report atomic insights of the NPG catalysis, characterized by spherical-aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and environmental TEM. A high density of atomic steps and kinks is observed on the curved surfaces of NPG, comparable to 3–5 nm nanoparticles, which are stabilized by hyperboloid-like gold ligaments. In situ TEM observations provide compelling evidence that the surface defects are active sites for the catalytic oxidation of CO and residual Ag stabilizes the atomic steps by suppressing {111} faceting kinetics."
1035,A Janus cobalt-based catalytic material for electro-splitting of water,2012-08-05,"The future of energy supply depends on innovative breakthroughs regarding the design of cheap, sustainable and efficient systems for the conversion and storage of renewable energy sources. The production of hydrogen through water splitting seems a promising and appealing solution. We found that a robust nanoparticulate electrocatalytic material, H2–CoCat, can be electrochemically prepared from cobalt salts in a phosphate buffer. This material consists of metallic cobalt coated with a cobalt-oxo/hydroxo-phosphate layer in contact with the electrolyte and mediates H2 evolution from neutral aqueous buffer at modest overpotentials. Remarkably, it can be converted on anodic equilibration into the previously described amorphous cobalt oxide film (O2–CoCat or CoPi) catalysing O2 evolution. The switch between the two catalytic forms is fully reversible and corresponds to a local interconversion between two morphologies and compositions at the surface of the electrode. After deposition, the noble-metal-free coating thus functions as a robust, bifunctional and switchable catalyst."
1036,A flexible and highly sensitive strain-gauge sensor using reversible interlocking of nanofibres,2012-07-29,"Flexible skin-attachable strain-gauge sensors are an essential component in the development of artificial systems that can mimic the complex characteristics of the human skin. In general, such sensors contain a number of circuits or complex layered matrix arrays. Here, we present a simple architecture for a flexible and highly sensitive strain sensor that enables the detection of pressure, shear and torsion. The device is based on two interlocked arrays of high-aspect-ratio Pt-coated polymeric nanofibres that are supported on thin polydimethylsiloxane layers. When different sensing stimuli are applied, the degree of interconnection and the electrical resistance of the sensor changes in a reversible, directional manner with specific, discernible strain-gauge factors. The sensor response is highly repeatable and reproducible up to 10,000 cycles with excellent on/off switching behaviour. We show that the sensor can be used to monitor signals ranging from human heartbeats to the impact of a bouncing water droplet on a superhydrophobic surface."
1037,Unification of trap-limited electron transport in semiconducting polymers,2012-07-29,"Electron transport in semiconducting polymers is usually inferior to hole transport, which is ascribed to charge trapping on isolated defect sites situated within the energy bandgap. However, a general understanding of the origin of these omnipresent charge traps, as well as their energetic position, distribution and concentration, is lacking. Here we investigate electron transport in a wide range of semiconducting polymers by current–voltage measurements of single-carrier devices. We observe for this materials class that electron transport is limited by traps that exhibit a Gaussian energy distribution in the bandgap. Remarkably, the electron-trap distribution is identical for all polymers considered: the number of traps amounts to 3 × 1023 traps per m3 centred at an energy of ~3.6 eV below the vacuum level, with a typical distribution width of ~0.1 eV. This indicates that the electron traps have a common origin that, we suggest, is most likely related to hydrated oxygen complexes. A consequence of this finding is that the trap-limited electron current can be predicted for any polymer."
1038,Single-crystal organic charge-transfer interfaces probed using Schottky-gated heterostructures,2012-07-22,"Organic semiconductors based on small conjugated molecules generally behave as insulators when undoped, but the heterointerfaces of two such materials can show electrical conductivity as large as in a metal. Although charge transfer is commonly invoked to explain the phenomenon, the details of the process and the nature of the interfacial charge carriers remain largely unexplored. Here we use Schottky-gated heterostructures to probe the conducting layer at the interface between rubrene and PDIF-CN2 single crystals. Gate-modulated conductivity measurements demonstrate that interfacial transport is due to electrons, whose mobility exhibits band-like behaviour from room temperature to ~150 K, and remains as high as ~1 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 30 K for the best devices. The electron density decreases linearly with decreasing temperature, an observation that can be explained quantitatively on the basis of the heterostructure band diagram. These results elucidate the electronic structure of rubrene/PDIF-CN2 interfaces and show the potential of Schottky-gated organic heterostructures for the investigation of transport in molecular semiconductors."
1039,Combination delivery of TGF-β inhibitor and IL-2 by nanoscale liposomal polymeric gels enhances tumour immunotherapy,2012-07-15,"The tumour microenvironment thwarts conventional immunotherapy through multiple immunologic mechanisms, such as the secretion of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), which stunts local tumour immune responses. Therefore, high doses of interleukin-2 (IL-2), a conventional cytokine for metastatic melanoma, induces only limited responses. To overcome the immunoinhibitory nature of the tumour microenvironment, we developed nanoscale liposomal polymeric gels (nanolipogels; nLGs) of drug-complexed cyclodextrins and cytokine-encapsulating biodegradable polymers that can deliver small hydrophobic molecular inhibitors and water-soluble protein cytokines in a sustained fashion to the tumour microenvironment. nLGs releasing TGF-β inhibitor and IL-2 significantly delayed tumour growth, increased survival of tumour-bearing mice, and increased the activity of natural killer cells and of intratumoral-activated CD8+ T-cell infiltration. We demonstrate that the efficacy of nLGs in tumour immunotherapy results from a crucial mechanism involving activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses."
1040,Tuning the autophagy-inducing activity of lanthanide-based nanocrystals through specific surface-coating peptides,2012-07-15,"The induction of autophagy on exposure of cells to a variety of nanoparticles represents both a safety concern and an application niche for engineered nanomaterials. Here, we show that a short synthetic peptide, RE-1, identified by means of phage display, binds to lanthanide (LN) oxide and upconversion nanocrystals (UCN), forms a stable coating layer on the nanoparticles’ surface, and effectively abrogates their autophagy-inducing activity. Furthermore, RE-1 peptide variants exhibit a differentially reduced binding capability, and correspondingly, a varied ability to reduce the autophagic response. We also show that the addition of an arginine–glycine–aspartic acid (RGD) motif to RE-1 enhances autophagy for LN UCN through the interaction with integrins. RE-1 and its variants provide a versatile tool for tuning material–cell interactions to achieve the desired level of autophagy, and may prove useful for the various diagnostic and therapeutic applications of LN-based nanomaterials and nanodevices."
1041,Ferroelectric order in individual nanometre-scale crystals,2012-07-08,"Ferroelectricity in finite-dimensional systems continues to arouse interest, motivated by predictions of vortex polarization states and the utility of ferroelectric nanomaterials in memory devices, actuators and other applications. Critical to these areas of research are the nanoscale polarization structure and scaling limit of ferroelectric order, which are determined here in individual nanocrystals comprising a single ferroelectric domain. Maps of ferroelectric structural distortions obtained from aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, combined with holographic polarization imaging, indicate the persistence of a linearly ordered and monodomain polarization state at nanometre dimensions. Room-temperature polarization switching is demonstrated down to ~5 nm dimensions. Ferroelectric coherence is facilitated in part by control of particle morphology, which along with electrostatic boundary conditions is found to determine the spatial extent of cooperative ferroelectric distortions. This work points the way to multi-Tbit/in2 memories and provides a glimpse of the structural and electrical manifestations of ferroelectricity down to its ultimate limits."
1042,Label-free identification of single dielectric nanoparticles and viruses with ultraweak polarization forces,2012-07-08,"Label-free detection of the material composition of nanoparticles could be enabled by the quantification of the nanoparticles’ inherent dielectric response to an applied electric field. However, the sensitivity of dielectric nanoscale objects to geometric and non-local effects makes the dielectric response extremely weak. Here we show that electrostatic force microscopy with sub-piconewton resolution can resolve the dielectric constants of single dielectric nanoparticles without the need for any reference material, as well as distinguish nanoparticles that have an identical surface but different inner composition. We unambiguously identified unlabelled ~10 nm nanoparticles of similar morphology but different low-polarizable materials, and discriminated empty from DNA-containing virus capsids. Our approach should make the in situ characterization of nanoscale dielectrics and biological macromolecules possible."
1043,"The predominant role of collagen in the nucleation, growth, structure and orientation of bone apatite",2012-07-01,"The involvement of collagen in bone biomineralization is commonly admitted, yet its role remains unclear. Here we show that type I collagen in vitro can initiate and orientate the growth of carbonated apatite mineral in the absence of any other vertebrate extracellular matrix molecules of calcifying tissues. We also show that the collagen matrix influences the structural characteristics on the atomic scale, and controls the size and the three-dimensional distribution of apatite at larger length scales. These results call into question recent consensus in the literature on the need for Ca-rich non-collagenous proteins for collagen mineralization to occur in vivo. Our model is based on a collagen/apatite self-assembly process that combines the ability to mimic the in vivo extracellular fluid with three major features inherent to living bone tissue, that is, high fibrillar density, monodispersed fibrils and long-range hierarchical organization."
1044,Soft fibrin gels promote selection and growth of tumorigenic cells,2012-07-01,"The identification of stem-cell-like cancer cells through conventional methods that depend on stem cell markers is often unreliable. We developed a mechanical method for selecting tumorigenic cells by culturing single cancer cells in fibrin matrices of ~100 Pa in stiffness. When cultured within these gels, primary human cancer cells or single cancer cells from mouse or human cancer cell lines grew within a few days into individual round colonies that resembled embryonic stem cell colonies. Subcutaneous or intravenous injection of 10 or 100 fibrin-cultured cells in syngeneic or severe combined immunodeficiency mice led to the formation of solid tumours at the site of injection or at the distant lung organ much more efficiently than control cancer cells selected using conventional surface marker methods or cultured on conventional rigid dishes or on soft gels. Remarkably, as few as ten such cells were able to survive and form tumours in the lungs of wild-type non-syngeneic mice."
1045,Solitonic lattice and Yukawa forces in the rare-earth orthoferrite TbFeO,2012-06-24,"The random fluctuations of spins give rise to many interesting physical phenomena, such as the ‘order-from-disorder’ arising in frustrated magnets and unconventional Cooper pairing in magnetic superconductors. Here we show that the exchange of spin waves between extended topological defects, such as domain walls, can result in novel magnetic states. We report the discovery of an unusual incommensurate phase in the orthoferrite TbFeO3 using neutron diffraction under an applied magnetic field. The magnetic modulation has a very long period of 340 Å at 3 K and exhibits an anomalously large number of higher-order harmonics. These domain walls are formed by Ising-like Tb spins. They interact by exchanging magnons propagating through the Fe magnetic sublattice. The resulting force between the domain walls has a rather long range that determines the period of the incommensurate state and is analogous to the pion-mediated Yukawa interaction between protons and neutrons in nuclei."
1046,Mesoscopic architectures of porous coordination polymers fabricated by pseudomorphic replication,2012-06-24,"The spatial organization of porous coordination polymer (PCP) crystals into higher-order structures is critical for their integration into separation systems, heterogeneous catalysts, ion/electron transport and photonic devices. Here, we demonstrate a rapid method to spatially control the nucleation site, leading to the formation of mesoscopic architecture made of PCPs, in both two and three dimensions. Inspired by geological processes, this method relies on the morphological replacement of a shaped sacrificial metal oxide used both as a metal source and as an ‘architecture-directing agent’ by an analogous PCP architecture. Spatiotemporal harmonization of the metal oxide dissolution and the PCP crystallization allowed the preservation of very fine mineral morphological details of periodic alumina inverse opal structures. The replication of randomly structured alumina aerogels resulted in a PCP architecture with hierarchical porosity in which the hydrophobic micropores of the PCP and the mesopores/macropores inherited from the parent aerogels synergistically enhanced the material’s selectivity and mass transfer for water/ethanol separation."
1047,Extraordinarily complex crystal structure with mesoscopic patterning in barium at high pressure,2012-06-10,"Elemental barium adopts a series of high-pressure phases with such complex crystal structures that some of them have eluded structure determination for many years. Using single-crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction and new data analysis strategies, we have now solved the most complex of these crystal structures, that of phase Ba-IVc at 19 GPa. It is a commensurate host–guest structure with 768 atoms in the representative unit, where the relative alignment of the guest-atom chains can be represented as a two-dimensional pattern with interlocking S-shaped 12-chain motifs repeating regularly in one direction and repeating with constrained disorder in the other. The existence of such patterning on the nanometre scale points at medium-range interactions that are not fully screened by the itinerant electrons in this metal. On the basis of first-principles electronic structure calculations, pseudopotential theory and an analysis of the lattice periodicities and interatomic distances, we rationalize why the Ba phases with the common densely packed crystal structures become energetically unfavourable in comparison with the complex-structured Ba-IVc phase, and what the role of the well-known pressure-induced s–d electronic transfer is."
1048,A partially interpenetrated metal–organic framework for selective hysteretic sorption of carbon dioxide,2012-06-03,"The selective capture of carbon dioxide in porous materials has potential for the storage and purification of fuel and flue gases. However, adsorption capacities under dynamic conditions are often insufficient for practical applications, and strategies to enhance CO2–host selectivity are required. The unique partially interpenetrated metal–organic framework NOTT-202 represents a new class of dynamic material that undergoes pronounced framework phase transition on desolvation. We report temperature-dependent adsorption/desorption hysteresis in desolvated NOTT-202a that responds selectively to CO2. The CO2 isotherm shows three steps in the adsorption profile at 195 K, and stepwise filling of pores generated within the observed partially interpenetrated structure has been modelled by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. Adsorption of N2, CH4, O2, Ar and H2 exhibits reversible isotherms without hysteresis under the same conditions, and this allows capture of gases at high pressure, but selectively leaves CO2 trapped in the nanopores at low pressure."
1049,Giant magnetocaloric effect driven by structural transitions,2012-05-27,"Magnetic cooling could be a radically different energy solution substituting conventional vapour compression refrigeration in the future. For the largest cooling effects of most potential refrigerants we need to fully exploit the different degrees of freedom such as magnetism and crystal structure. We report now for Heusler-type Ni–Mn–In–(Co) magnetic shape-memory alloys, the adiabatic temperature change ΔTad = −3.6 to −6.2 K under a moderate field of 2 T. Here it is the structural transition that plays the dominant role towards the net cooling effect. A phenomenological model is established that reveals the parameters essential for such a large ΔTad. We also demonstrate that obstacles to the application of Heusler alloys, namely the usually large hysteresis and limited operating temperature window, can be overcome by using the multi-response to different external stimuli and/or fine-tuning the lattice parameters, and by stacking a series of alloys with tailored magnetostructural transitions."
1050,Extracellular-matrix tethering regulates stem-cell fate,2012-05-27,"To investigate how substrate properties influence stem-cell fate, we cultured single human epidermal stem cells on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogel surfaces, 0.1 kPa–2.3 MPa in stiffness, with a covalently attached collagen coating. Cell spreading and differentiation were unaffected by polydimethylsiloxane stiffness. However, cells on polyacrylamide of low elastic modulus (0.5 kPa) could not form stable focal adhesions and differentiated as a result of decreased activation of the extracellular-signal-related kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway. The differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells was also unaffected by PDMS stiffness but regulated by the elastic modulus of PAAm. Dextran penetration measurements indicated that polyacrylamide substrates of low elastic modulus were more porous than stiff substrates, suggesting that the collagen anchoring points would be further apart. We then changed collagen crosslink concentration and used hydrogel–nanoparticle substrates to vary anchoring distance at constant substrate stiffness. Lower collagen anchoring density resulted in increased differentiation. We conclude that stem cells exert a mechanical force on collagen fibres and gauge the feedback to make cell-fate decisions."
1051, screening of carbon-capture materials,2012-05-27,"One of the main bottlenecks to deploying large-scale carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) in power plants is the energy required to separate the CO2 from flue gas. For example, near-term CCS technology applied to coal-fired power plants is projected to reduce the net output of the plant by some 30% and to increase the cost of electricity by 60–80%. Developing capture materials and processes that reduce the parasitic energy imposed by CCS is therefore an important area of research. We have developed a computational approach to rank adsorbents for their performance in CCS. Using this analysis, we have screened hundreds of thousands of zeolite and zeolitic imidazolate framework structures and identified many different structures that have the potential to reduce the parasitic energy of CCS by 30–40% compared with near-term technologies."
1052,Mechanical metamaterials with negative compressibility transitions,2012-05-20,"When tensioned, ordinary materials expand along the direction of the applied force. Here, we explore network concepts to design metamaterials exhibiting negative compressibility transitions, during which a material undergoes contraction when tensioned (or expansion when pressured). Continuous contraction of a material in the same direction of an applied tension, and in response to this tension, is inherently unstable. The conceptually similar effect we demonstrate can be achieved, however, through destabilizations of (meta)stable equilibria of the constituents. These destabilizations give rise to a stress-induced solid–solid phase transition associated with a twisted hysteresis curve for the stress–strain relationship. The strain-driven counterpart of negative compressibility transitions is a force amplification phenomenon, where an increase in deformation induces a discontinuous increase in response force. We suggest that the proposed materials could be useful for the design of actuators, force amplifiers, micromechanical controls, and protective devices."
1053,A search model for topological insulators with high-throughput robustness descriptors,2012-05-13,"Topological insulators (TI) are becoming one of the most studied classes of novel materials because of their great potential for applications ranging from spintronics to quantum computers. To fully integrate TI materials in electronic devices, high-quality epitaxial single-crystalline phases with sufficiently large bulk bandgaps are necessary. Current efforts have relied mostly on costly and time-consuming trial-and-error procedures. Here we show that by defining a reliable and accessible descriptor , which represents the topological robustness or feasibility of the candidate, and by searching the quantum materials repository aflowlib.org, we have automatically discovered 28 TIs (some of them already known) in five different symmetry families. These include peculiar ternary halides, Cs{Sn,Pb,Ge}{Cl,Br,I}3, which could have been hardly anticipated without high-throughput means. Our search model, by relying on the significance of repositories in materials development, opens new avenues for the discovery of more TIs in different and unexplored classes of systems."
1054,Room-temperature metastability of multilayer graphene oxide films,2012-05-06,"Graphene oxide potentially has multiple applications. The chemistry of graphene oxide and its response to external stimuli such as temperature and light are not well understood and only approximately controlled. This understanding is crucial to enable future applications of this material. Here, a combined experimental and density functional theory study shows that multilayer graphene oxide produced by oxidizing epitaxial graphene through the Hummers method is a metastable material whose structure and chemistry evolve at room temperature with a characteristic relaxation time of about one month. At the quasi-equilibrium, graphene oxide reaches a nearly stable reduced O/C ratio, and exhibits a structure deprived of epoxide groups and enriched in hydroxyl groups. Our calculations show that the structural and chemical changes are driven by the availability of hydrogen in the oxidized graphitic sheets, which favours the reduction of epoxide groups and the formation of water molecules."
1055,Trends in activity for the water electrolyser reactions on 3,2012-05-06,"Design and synthesis of materials for efficient electrochemical transformation of water to molecular hydrogen and of hydroxyl ions to oxygen in alkaline environments is of paramount importance in reducing energy losses in water–alkali electrolysers. Here, using 3d-M hydr(oxy)oxides, with distinct stoichiometries and morphologies in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) regions, we establish the overall catalytic activities for these reaction as a function of a more fundamental property, a descriptor, OH–M2+δ bond strength (0 ≤  δ  ≤ 1.5). This relationship exhibits trends in reactivity (Mn < Fe < Co < Ni), which is governed by the strength of the OH–M2+δ energetic (Ni < Co < Fe < Mn). These trends are found to be independent of the source of the OH, either the supporting electrolyte (for the OER) or the water dissociation product (for the HER). The successful identification of these electrocatalytic trends provides the foundation for rational design of ‘active sites’ for practical alkaline HER and OER electrocatalysts."
1056,Atomically controlled electrochemical nucleation at superionic solid electrolyte surfaces,2012-04-29,"Electrochemical equilibrium and the transfer of mass and charge through interfaces at the atomic scale are of fundamental importance for the microscopic understanding of elementary physicochemical processes. Approaching atomic dimensions, phase instabilities and instrumentation limits restrict the resolution. Here we show an ultimate lateral, mass and charge resolution during electrochemical Ag phase formation at the surface of RbAg4I5 superionic conductor thin films. We found that a small amount of electron donors in the solid electrolyte enables scanning tunnelling microscope measurements and atomically resolved imaging. We demonstrate that Ag critical nucleus formation is rate limiting. The Gibbs energy of this process takes discrete values and the number of atoms of the critical nucleus remains constant over a large range of applied potentials. Our approach is crucial to elucidate the mechanism of atomic switches and highlights the possibility of extending this method to a variety of other electrochemical systems."
1057,Exchange biasing of magnetoelectric composites,2012-04-22,"Magnetoelectric composite materials are promising candidates for highly sensitive magnetic-field sensors. However, the composites showing the highest reported magnetoelectric coefficients require the presence of external d.c. magnetic bias fields, which is detrimental to their use as sensitive high-resolution magnetic-field sensors. Here, we report magnetoelectric composite materials that instead rely on intrinsic magnetic fields arising from exchange bias in the device. Thin-film magnetoelectric two–two composites were fabricated by magnetron sputtering on silicon-cantilever substrates. The composites consist of piezoelectric AlN and multilayers with the sequence Ta/Cu/Mn70Ir30/Fe50Co50 or Ta/Cu/Mn70Ir30/Fe70.2Co7.8Si12B10 serving as the magnetostrictive component. The thickness of the ferromagnetic layers and angle dependency of the exchange bias field are used to adjust the shift of the magnetostriction curve in such a way that the maximum piezomagnetic coefficient occurs at zero magnetic bias field. These self-biased composites show high sensitivity to a.c. magnetic fields with a maximum magnetoelectric coefficient of 96 V cm−1 Oe−1 at mechanical resonance."
1058,Polarized X-ray scattering reveals non-crystalline orientational ordering in organic films,2012-04-15,"Molecular orientation critically influences the mechanical, chemical, optical and electronic properties of organic materials. So far, molecular-scale ordering in soft matter could be characterized with X-ray or electron microscopy techniques only if the sample exhibited sufficient crystallinity. Here, we show that the resonant scattering of polarized soft X-rays (P-SoXS) by molecular orbitals is not limited by crystallinity and that it can be used to probe molecular orientation down to size scales of 10 nm. We first apply the technique on highly crystalline small-molecule thin films and subsequently use its high sensitivity to probe the impact of liquid-crystalline ordering on charge mobility in polymeric transistors. P-SoXS also reveals scattering anisotropy in amorphous domains of all-polymer organic solar cells where interfacial interactions pattern orientational alignment in the matrix phase, which probably plays an important role in the photophysics. The energy and q-dependence of the scattering anisotropy allows the identification of the composition and the degree of orientational order in the domains."
1059,Sparsity-based single-shot subwavelength coherent diffractive imaging,2012-04-01,"Coherent Diffractive Imaging (CDI) is an algorithmic imaging technique where intricate features are reconstructed from measurements of the freely diffracting intensity pattern. An important goal of such lensless imaging methods is to study the structure of molecules that cannot be crystallized. Ideally, one would want to perform CDI at the highest achievable spatial resolution and in a single-shot measurement such that it could be applied to imaging of ultrafast events. However, the resolution of current CDI techniques is limited by the diffraction limit, hence they cannot resolve features smaller than one half the wavelength of the illuminating light. Here, we present sparsity-based single-shot subwavelength resolution CDI: algorithmic reconstruction of subwavelength features from far-field intensity patterns, at a resolution several times better than the diffraction limit. This work paves the way for subwavelength CDI at ultrafast rates, and it can considerably improve the CDI resolution with X-ray free-electron lasers and high harmonics."
1060,Infrared metamaterial phase holograms,2012-03-18,"As a result of advances in nanotechnology and the burgeoning capabilities for fabricating materials with controlled nanoscale geometries, the traditional notion of what constitutes an optical device continues to evolve. The fusion of maturing low-cost lithographic techniques with newer optical design strategies has enabled the introduction of artificially structured metamaterials in place of conventional materials for improving optical components as well as realizing new optical functionality. Here we demonstrate multilayer, lithographically patterned, subwavelength, metal elements, whose distribution forms a computer-generated phase hologram in the infrared region (10.6 μm). Metal inclusions exhibit extremely large scattering and can be implemented in metamaterials that exhibit a wide range of effective medium response, including anomalously large or negative refractive index; optical magnetism; and controlled anisotropy. This large palette of metamaterial responses can be leveraged to achieve greater control over the propagation of light, leading to more compact, efficient and versatile optical components."
1061,Polyvalent choline phosphate as a universal biomembrane adhesive,2012-03-18,"Phospholipids in the cell membranes of all eukaryotic cells contain phosphatidyl choline (PC) as the headgroup. Here we show that hyperbranched polyglycerols (HPGs) decorated with the ’PC-inverse’ choline phosphate (CP) in a polyvalent fashion can electrostatically bind to a variety of cell membranes and to PC-containing liposomes, the binding strength depending on the number density of CP groups per macromolecule. We also show that HPG–CPs can cause cells to adhere with varying affinity to other cells, and that binding can be reversed by subsequent exposure to low molecular weight HPGs carrying small numbers of PCs. Moreover, PC-rich membranes adsorb and rapidly internalize fluorescent HPG–CP but not HPG–PC molecules, which suggests that HPG–CPs could be used as drug-delivery agents. CP-decorated polymers should find broad use, for instance as tissue sealants and in the self-assembly of lipid nanostructures."
1062,A silica sol–gel design strategy for nanostructured metallic materials,2012-03-18,"Batteries, fuel cells and solar cells, among many other high-current-density devices, could benefit from the precise meso- to macroscopic structure control afforded by the silica sol–gel process. The porous materials made by silica sol–gel chemistry are typically insulators, however, which has restricted their application. Here we present a simple, yet highly versatile silica sol–gel process built around a multifunctional sol–gel precursor that is derived from the following: amino acids, hydroxy acids or peptides; a silicon alkoxide; and a metal acetate. This approach allows a wide range of biological functionalities and metals—including noble metals—to be combined into a library of sol–gel materials with a high degree of control over composition and structure. We demonstrate that the sol–gel process based on these precursors is compatible with block-copolymer self-assembly, colloidal crystal templating and the Stöber process. As a result of the exceptionally high metal content, these materials can be thermally processed to make porous nanocomposites with metallic percolation networks that have an electrical conductivity of over 1,000 S cm−1. This improves the electrical conductivity of porous silica sol–gel nanocomposites by three orders of magnitude over existing approaches, opening applications to high-current-density devices."
1063,Liquid–liquid transition without macroscopic phase separation in a water–glycerol mixture,2012-03-18,"The existence of more than two liquid states in a single-component substance and the ensuing liquid–liquid transitions (LLTs) has attracted considerable attention because of its counterintuitive nature and its importance in the fundamental understanding of the liquid state. Here we report direct experimental evidence for a genuine (isocompositional) LLT without macroscopic phase separation in an aqueous solution of glycerol. We show that liquid I transforms into liquid II by way of two types of kinetics: nucleation and growth, and spinodal decomposition. Although liquid II is metastable against crystallization, we could access both its static and dynamical properties experimentally. We find that liquids I and II differ in density, refractive index, structure, hydrogen bonding state, glass transition temperature and fragility, and that the transition between the two liquids is mainly driven by the local structuring of water rather than of glycerol, suggesting a link to a plausible LLT inpure water."
1064,"Controlling the Curie temperature in (Ga,Mn)As through location of the Fermi level within the impurity band",2012-02-19,"The ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As has emerged as the most studied material for prototype applications in semiconductor spintronics. Because ferromagnetism in (Ga,Mn)As is hole-mediated, the nature of the hole states has direct and crucial bearing on its Curie temperature TC. It is vigorously debated, however, whether holes in (Ga,Mn)As reside in the valence band or in an impurity band. Here we combine results of channelling experiments, which measure the concentrations both of Mn ions and of holes relevant to the ferromagnetic order, with magnetization, transport, and magneto-optical data to address this issue. Taken together, these measurements provide strong evidence that it is the location of the Fermi level within the impurity band that determines TC through determining the degree of hole localization. This finding differs drastically from the often accepted view that TC is controlled by valence band holes, thus opening new avenues for achieving higher values of TC."
1065,"New magnetic phase diagram of (Sr,Ca)",2012-02-19,"High- Tc cuprates, iron pnictides, organic BEDT and TMTSF, alkali-doped C60, and heavy-fermion systems have superconducting states adjacent to competing states exhibiting static antiferromagnetic or spin density wave order. This feature has promoted pictures for their superconducting pairing mediated by spin fluctuations. Sr2RuO4 is another unconventional superconductor which almost certainly has a p-wave pairing. The absence of known signatures of static magnetism in the Sr-rich side of the (Ca, Sr) substitution space, however, has led to a prevailing view that the superconducting state in Sr2RuO4 emerges from a surrounding Fermi-liquid metallic state. Using muon spin relaxation and magnetic susceptibility measurements, we demonstrate here that (Sr,Ca)2RuO4 has a ground state with static magnetic order over nearly the entire range of (Ca, Sr) substitution, with spin-glass behaviour in Sr1.5Ca0.5RuO4 and Ca1.5Sr0.5RuO4. The resulting new magnetic phase diagram establishes the proximity of superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 to competing static magnetic order."
1066,Mesoporous organohydrogels from thermogelling photocrosslinkable nanoemulsions,2012-02-12,"We report the formation of mesoporous organohydrogels from oil-in-water nanoemulsions containing an end-functionalized oligomeric gelator in the aqueous phase. The nanoemulsions exhibit an abrupt thermoreversible transition from a low-viscosity liquid to a fractal-like colloidal gel of droplets with mesoscale porosity and solid-like viscoelasticity with moduli approaching 100 kPa, possibly the highest reported for an emulsion-based system. We hypothesize that gelation is brought about by temperature-induced interdroplet bridging of the gelator, as shown by its dependence on the gelator chemistry. The use of photocrosslinkable gelators enables the freezing of the nanoemulsion’s microstructure into a soft hydrogel nanocomposite containing a large fraction of dispersed liquid hydrophobic compartments, and we show its use in the encapsulation and release of lipophilic biomolecules. The tunable structural, mechanical and optical properties of these organohydrogels make them a robust material platform suitable for a wide range of applications."
1067,Nanoscale strain-induced pair suppression as a vortex-pinning mechanism in high-temperature superconductors,2012-02-12,"Boosting large-scale superconductor applications require nanostructured conductors with artificial pinning centres immobilizing quantized vortices at high temperature and magnetic fields. Here we demonstrate a highly effective mechanism of artificial pinning centres in solution-derived high-temperature superconductor nanocomposites through generation of nanostrained regions where Cooper pair formation is suppressed. The nanostrained regions identified from transmission electron microscopy devise a very high concentration of partial dislocations associated with intergrowths generated between the randomly oriented nanodots and the epitaxial YBa2Cu3O7 matrix. Consequently, an outstanding vortex-pinning enhancement correlated to the nanostrain is demonstrated for four types of randomly oriented nanodot, and a unique evolution towards an isotropic vortex-pinning behaviour, even in the effective anisotropy, is achieved as the nanostrain turns isotropic. We suggest a new vortex-pinning mechanism based on the bond-contraction pairing model, where pair formation is quenched under tensile strain, forming new and effective core-pinning regions."
1068,Ultrastable nanostructured polymer glasses,2012-02-05,"Owing to the kinetic nature of the glass transition, the ability to significantly alter the properties of amorphous solids by the typical routes to the vitreous state is restricted. For instance, an order of magnitude change in the cooling rate merely modifies the value of the glass transition temperature (Tg) by a few degrees. Here we show that matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE) can be used to form ultrastable and nanostructured glassy polymer films which, relative to the standard poly(methyl methacrylate) glass formed on cooling at standard rates, are 40% less dense, have a 40 K higher Tg, and exhibit a two orders of magnitude enhancement in kinetic stability at high temperatures. The unique set of properties of MAPLE-deposited glasses may make them attractive in technologies where weight and stability are central design issues."
1069,Self-limited plasmonic welding of silver nanowire junctions,2012-02-05,"Nanoscience provides many strategies to construct high-performance materials and devices, including solar cells, thermoelectrics, sensors, transistors, and transparent electrodes. Bottom-up fabrication facilitates large-scale chemical synthesis without the need for patterning and etching processes that waste material and create surface defects. However, assembly and contacting procedures still require further development. Here, we demonstrate a light-induced plasmonic nanowelding technique to assemble metallic nanowires into large interconnected networks. The small gaps that form naturally at nanowire junctions enable effective light concentration and heating at the point where the wires need to be joined together. The extreme sensitivity of the heating efficiency on the junction geometry causes the welding process to self-limit when a physical connection between the wires is made. The localized nature of the heating prevents damage to low-thermal-budget substrates such as plastics and polymer solar cells. This work opens new avenues to control light, heat and mass transport at the nanoscale."
1070,Synthetic mast-cell granules as adjuvants to promote and polarize immunity in lymph nodes,2012-01-22,"Granules of mast cells (MCs) enhance adaptive immunity when, on activation, they are released as stable particles. Here we show that submicrometre particles modelled after MC granules augment immunity when used as adjuvants in vaccines. The synthetic particles, which consist of a carbohydrate backbone with encapsulated inflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor, replicate attributes of MCs in vivo including the targeting of draining lymph nodes and the timed release of the encapsulated mediators. When used as an adjuvant during vaccination of mice with haemagglutinin from the influenza virus, the particles enhanced adaptive immune responses and increased survival of mice on lethal challenge. Furthermore, differential loading of the particles with the cytokine IL-12 directed the character of the response towards Th1 lymphocytes. The synthetic MC adjuvants replicate and enhance the functions of MCs during vaccination, and can be extended to polarize the resulting immunity."
1071,A new class of doped nanobulk high-figure-of-merit thermoelectrics by scalable bottom-up assembly,2012-01-10,"Obtaining thermoelectric materials with high figure of merit ZT is an exacting challenge because it requires the independent control of electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, which are often unfavourably coupled. Recent works have devised strategies based on nanostructuring and alloying to address this challenge in thin films, and to obtain bulk p-type alloys with ZT>1. Here, we demonstrate a new class of both p- and n-type bulk nanomaterials with room-temperature ZT as high as 1.1 using a combination of sub-atomic-per-cent doping and nanostructuring. Our nanomaterials were fabricated by bottom-up assembly of sulphur-doped pnictogen chalcogenide nanoplates sculpted by a scalable microwave-stimulated wet-chemical method. Bulk nanomaterials from single-component assemblies or nanoplate mixtures of different materials exhibit 25–250% higher ZT than their non-nanostructured bulk counterparts and state-of-the-art alloys. Adapting our synthesis and assembly approach should enable nanobulk thermoelectrics with further increases in ZT for transforming thermoelectric refrigeration and power harvesting technologies."
1072,Morphological instability leading to formation of porous anodic oxide films,2011-12-04,"Electrochemical oxidation of metals, in solutions where the oxide is somewhat soluble, produces anodic oxides with highly regular arrangements of pores. Although porous aluminium and titanium oxides have found extensive use in functional nanostructures, pore initiation and self-ordering are not yet understood. Here we present an analysis that examines the roles of oxide dissolution and ionic conduction in the morphological stability of anodic films. We show that patterns of pores with a minimum spacing are possible only within a narrow range of the oxide formation efficiency (the fraction of oxidized metal atoms retained in the film), which should exist when the metal ion charge exceeds two. Experimentally measured efficiencies, over diverse anodizing conditions on both aluminium and titanium, lie within the different ranges predicted for each metal. On the basis of these results, the relationship between dissolution chemistry and the conditions for pore initiation can now be understood in quantitative terms."
1073,Electron spin coherence exceeding seconds in high-purity silicon,2011-12-04,"Silicon is one of the most promising semiconductor materials for spin-based information processing devices1,2. Its advanced fabrication technology facilitates the transition from individual devices to large-scale processors, and the availability of a 28Si form with no magnetic nuclei overcomes a primary source of spin decoherence in many other materials3,4. Nevertheless, the coherence lifetimes of electron spins in the solid state have typically remained several orders of magnitude lower than that achieved in isolated high-vacuum systems such as trapped ions5. Here we examine electron spin coherence of donors in pure 28Si material (residual 29Si concentration <50 ppm) with donor densities of 1014–1015 cm−3. We elucidate three mechanisms for spin decoherence, active at different temperatures, and extract a coherence lifetime T2 up to 2 s. In this regime, we find the electron spin is sensitive to interactions with other donor electron spins separated by ~200 nm. A magnetic field gradient suppresses such interactions, producing an extrapolated electron spin T2 of 10 s at 1.8 K. These coherence lifetimes are without peer in the solid state and comparable to high-vacuum qubits, making electron spins of donors in silicon ideal components of quantum computers2,6, or quantum memories for systems such as superconducting qubits7,8,9."
1074,Biodegradable poly(amine-,2011-12-04,"Many synthetic polycationic vectors for non-viral gene delivery show high efficiency in vitro, but their usually excessive charge density makes them toxic for in vivo applications. Here we describe the synthesis of a series of high molecular weight terpolymers with low charge density, and show that they exhibit efficient gene delivery, some surpassing the efficiency of the commercial transfection reagents Polyethylenimine and Lipofectamine 2000. The terpolymers were synthesized via enzyme-catalyzed copolymerization of lactone with dialkyl diester and amino diol, and their hydrophobicity adjusted by varying the lactone content and by selecting a lactone comonomer of specific ring size. Targeted delivery of the pro-apoptotic TRAIL gene to tumour xenografts by one of the terpolymers results in significant inhibition of tumour growth, with minimal toxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that the gene delivery ability of the terpolymers stems from their high molecular weight and increased hydrophobicity, which compensates for their low charge density."
1075,Second-harmonic generation in silicon waveguides strained by silicon nitride,2011-12-04,"Silicon photonics meets the electronics requirement of increased speed and bandwidth with on-chip optical networks. All-optical data management requires nonlinear silicon photonics. In silicon only third-order optical nonlinearities are present owing to its crystalline inversion symmetry. Introducing a second-order nonlinearity into silicon photonics by proper material engineering would be highly desirable. It would enable devices for wideband wavelength conversion operating at relatively low optical powers. Here we show that a sizeable second-order nonlinearity at optical wavelengths is induced in a silicon waveguide by using a stressing silicon nitride overlayer. We carried out second-harmonic-generation experiments and first-principle calculations, which both yield large values of strain-induced bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility, up to 40 pm V−1 at 2,300 nm. We envisage that nonlinear strained silicon could provide a competing platform for a new class of integrated light sources spanning the near- to mid-infrared spectrum from 1.2 to 10 μm."
1076,High electrochemical activity of the oxide phase in model ceria–Pt and ceria–Ni composite anodes,2011-12-04,"Fuel cells, and in particular solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), enable high-efficiency conversion of chemical fuels into useful electrical energy and, as such, are expected to play a major role in a sustainable-energy future. A key step in the fuel-cell energy-conversion process is the electro-oxidation of the fuel at the anode. There has been increasing evidence in recent years that the presence of CeO2-based oxides (ceria) in the anodes of SOFCs with oxygen-ion-conducting electrolytes significantly lowers the activation overpotential for hydrogen oxidation. Most of these studies, however, employ porous, composite electrode structures with ill-defined geometry and uncontrolled interfacial properties. Accordingly, the means by which electrocatalysis is enhanced has remained unclear. Here we demonstrate unambiguously, through the use of ceria–metal structures with well-defined geometries and interfaces, that the near-equilibrium H2 oxidation reaction pathway is dominated by electrocatalysis at the oxide/gas interface with minimal contributions from the oxide/metal/gas triple-phase boundaries, even for structures with reaction-site densities approaching those of commercial SOFCs. This insight points towards ceria nanostructuring as a route to enhanced activity, rather than the traditional paradigm of metal-catalyst nanostructuring."
1077,H-atom relay reactions in real space,2011-11-27,"Hydrogen bonds are the path through which protons and hydrogen atoms can be transferred between molecules. The relay mechanism, in which H-atom transfer occurs in a sequential fashion along hydrogen bonds, plays an essential role in many functional compounds. Here we use the scanning tunnelling microscope to construct and operate a test-bed for real-space observation of H-atom relay reactions at a single-molecule level. We demonstrate that the transfer of H-atoms along hydrogen-bonded chains assembled on a Cu(110) surface is controllable and reversible, and is triggered by excitation of molecular vibrations induced by inelastic tunnelling electrons. The experimental findings are rationalized by ab initio calculations for adsorption geometry, active vibrational modes and reaction pathway, to reach a detailed microscopic picture of the elementary processes."
1078,Sunlight-activated long-persistent luminescence in the near-infrared from Cr,2011-11-20,"Visible-light persistent phosphors are being widely used as self-sustained night-vision materials because of their sufficiently strong and long afterglow (>10 h) and their ability to be excited by sunlight as well as room light. In contrast, persistent phosphors for near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths are lacking. Here we report a series of Cr3+-doped zinc gallogermanate NIR persistent phosphors that exhibit strong emission at 650–1,000 nm, extending beyond the typical 690–750 nm, and with a super-long afterglow of more than 360 h. These new NIR persistent phosphors are all-weather materials that can be rapidly, effectively and repeatedly charged by natural sunlight in almost all kinds of outdoor environment. Seconds to minutes of sunlight activation can result in more than two weeks of persistent NIR light emission. This new series of NIR persistent materials have potential applications in night-vision surveillance, solar energy utilization and in vivo bio-imaging."
1079,Electric-field-assisted switching in magnetic tunnel junctions,2011-11-13,"The advent of spin transfer torque effect accommodates site-specific switching of magnetic nanostructures by current alone without magnetic field. However, the critical current density required for usual spin torque switching remains stubbornly high around 106–107 A cm−2. It would be fundamentally transformative if an electric field through a voltage could assist or accomplish the switching of ferromagnets. Here we report electric-field-assisted reversible switching in CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB magnetic tunnel junctions with interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, where the coercivity, the magnetic configuration and the tunnelling magnetoresistance can be manipulated by voltage pulses associated with much smaller current densities. These results represent a crucial step towards ultralow energy switching in magnetic tunnel junctions, and open a new avenue for exploring other voltage-controlled spintronic devices."
1080,Fano-resonant asymmetric metamaterials for ultrasensitive spectroscopy and identification of molecular monolayers,2011-11-13,"Engineered optical metamaterials present a unique platform for biosensing applications owing to their ability to confine light to nanoscale regions and to their spectral selectivity. Infrared plasmonic metamaterials are especially attractive because their resonant response can be accurately tuned to that of the vibrational modes of the target biomolecules. Here we introduce an infrared plasmonic surface based on a Fano-resonant asymmetric metamaterial exhibiting sharp resonances caused by the interference between subradiant and superradiant plasmonic resonances. Owing to the metamaterial’s asymmetry, the frequency of the subradiant resonance can be precisely determined and matched to the molecule’s vibrational fingerprints. A multipixel array of Fano-resonant asymmetric metamaterials is used as a platform for multispectral biosensing of nanometre-scale monolayers of recognition proteins and their surface orientation, as well as for detecting chemical binding of target antibodies to recognition proteins."
1081,Universal energy-level alignment of molecules on metal oxides,2011-11-06,"Transition-metal oxides improve power conversion efficiencies in organic photovoltaics and are used as low-resistance contacts in organic light-emitting diodes and organic thin-film transistors. What makes metal oxides useful in these technologies is the fact that their chemical and electronic properties can be tuned to enable charge exchange with a wide variety of organic molecules. Although it is known that charge exchange relies on the alignment of donor and acceptor energy levels, the mechanism for level alignment remains under debate. Here, we conclusively establish the principle of energy alignment between oxides and molecules. We observe a universal energy-alignment trend for a set of transition-metal oxides—representing a broad diversity in electronic properties—with several organic semiconductors. The trend demonstrates that, despite the variance in their electronic properties, oxide energy alignment is governed by one driving force: electron-chemical-potential equilibration. Using a combination of simple thermodynamics, electrostatics and Fermi statistics we derive a mathematical relation that describes the alignment."
1082,Electrochemical activation and inhibition of neuromuscular systems through modulation of ion concentrations with ion-selective membranes,2011-10-23,"Conventional functional electrical stimulation aims to restore functional motor activity of patients with disabilities resulting from spinal cord injury or neurological disorders. However, intervention with functional electrical stimulation in neurological diseases lacks an effective implantable method that suppresses unwanted nerve signals. We have developed an electrochemical method to activate and inhibit a nerve by electrically modulating ion concentrations in situ along the nerve. Using ion-selective membranes to achieve different excitability states of the nerve, we observe either a reduction of the electrical threshold for stimulation by up to approximately 40%, or voluntary, reversible inhibition of nerve signal propagation. This low-threshold electrochemical stimulation method is applicable in current implantable neuroprosthetic devices, whereas the on-demand nerve-blocking mechanism could offer effective clinical intervention in disease states caused by uncontrolled nerve activation, such as epilepsy and chronic pain syndromes."
1083,Tuning upconversion through energy migration in core–shell nanoparticles,2011-10-23,"Photon upconversion is promising for applications such as biological imaging, data storage or solar cells. Here, we have investigated upconversion processes in a broad range of gadolinium-based nanoparticles of varying composition. We show that by rational design of a core–shell structure with a set of lanthanide ions incorporated into separated layers at precisely defined concentrations, efficient upconversion emission can be realized through gadolinium sublattice-mediated energy migration for a wide range of lanthanide activators without long-lived intermediary energy states. Furthermore, the use of the core–shell structure allows the elimination of deleterious cross-relaxation. This effect enables fine-tuning of upconversion emission through trapping of the migrating energy by the activators. Indeed, the findings described here suggest a general approach to constructing a new class of luminescent materials with tunable upconversion emissions by controlled manipulation of energy transfer within a nanoscopic region."
1084,Flexoelectric rotation of polarization in ferroelectric thin films,2011-10-16,"Strain engineering enables modification of the properties of thin films using the stress from the substrates on which they are grown. Strain may be relaxed, however, and this can also modify the properties thanks to the coupling between strain gradient and polarization known as flexoelectricity. Here we have studied the strain distribution inside epitaxial films of the archetypal ferroelectric PbTiO3, where the mismatch with the substrate is relaxed through the formation of domains (twins). Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal an intricate strain distribution, with gradients in both the vertical and, unexpectedly, the horizontal direction. These gradients generate a horizontal flexoelectricity that forces the spontaneous polarization to rotate away from the normal. Polar rotations are a characteristic of compositionally engineered morphotropic phase boundary ferroelectrics with high piezoelectricity; flexoelectricity provides an alternative route for generating such rotations in standard ferroelectrics using purely physical means."
1085,Molecular control of quantum-dot internal electric field and its application to CdSe-based solar cells,2011-10-09,"Inorganic nanocrystals are attractive materials for solar-cell applications. However, the performance of such devices is often limited by an insufficient alignment of energy levels in the nanocrystals. Here, we report that by attaching two different molecules to a single quantum dot or nanocrystal one can induce electric fields large enough to significantly alter the electronic and optoelectronic properties of the quantum dot. This electric field is created within the nanocrystals owing to a mixture of amine- and thiol-anchor-group ligands. Examining the steady state as well as temporal evolution of the optical properties and the nuclear magnetic resonances of the nanocrystals we found that the first excitonic peak shifts as a function of the capping-layer composition. We also demonstrate that the use of a mixed-ligand-induced electric field markedly enhances the charge generation efficiency in layer-by-layer CdSe-nanocrystal-based solar cells, thus improving the overall cell efficiency."
1086,Resolving strain in carbon nanotubes at the atomic level,2011-10-02,"Details of how atomic structure responds to strain are essential for building a deeper picture of mechanics in nanomaterials. Here, we provide the first experimental evidence of atomic displacements associated with shear strain in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) by direct imaging using aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy. The atomic structure of a zig-zag SWNT is resolved with unprecedented accuracy and the strain induced by bending is mapped in two dimensions. We show the existence of a dominant non-uniform shear strain that varies along the SWNT axis. The direction of shear is opposite to what would be expected from a simple force applied perpendicular to the axis to produce the bending. This highlights the complex atomistic strain behaviour of beam-bending mechanics in highly anisotropic SWNTs."
1087,Turning aluminium into a noble-metal-like catalyst for low-temperature activation of molecular hydrogen,2011-09-25,"Activation of molecular hydrogen is the first step in producing many important industrial chemicals that have so far required expensive noble-metal catalysts and thermal activation. We demonstrate here that aluminium doped with very small amounts of titanium can activate molecular hydrogen at temperatures as low as 90 K. Using an approach that uses CO as a probe molecule, we identify the atomistic arrangement of the catalytically active sites containing Ti on Al(111) surfaces, combining infrared reflection–absorption spectroscopy and first-principles modelling. CO molecules, selectively adsorbed on catalytically active sites, form a complex with activated hydrogen that is removed at remarkably low temperatures (115 K; possibly as a molecule). These results provide the first direct evidence that Ti-doped Al can carry out the essential first step of molecular hydrogen activation under nearly barrierless conditions, thereby challenging the monopoly of noble metals in hydrogen activation."
1088,Colloidal-quantum-dot photovoltaics using atomic-ligand passivation,2011-09-18,"Colloidal-quantum-dot (CQD) optoelectronics offer a compelling combination of solution processing and spectral tunability through quantum size effects. So far, CQD solar cells have relied on the use of organic ligands to passivate the surface of the semiconductor nanoparticles. Although inorganic metal chalcogenide ligands have led to record electronic transport parameters in CQD films, no photovoltaic device has been reported based on such compounds. Here we establish an atomic ligand strategy that makes use of monovalent halide anions to enhance electronic transport and successfully passivate surface defects in PbS CQD films. Both time-resolved infrared spectroscopy and transient device characterization indicate that the scheme leads to a shallower trap state distribution than the best organic ligands. Solar cells fabricated following this strategy show up to 6% solar AM1.5G power-conversion efficiency. The CQD films are deposited at room temperature and under ambient atmosphere, rendering the process amenable to low-cost, roll-by-roll fabrication."
1089,Gas detection by structural variations of fluorescent guest molecules in a flexible porous coordination polymer,2011-09-04,"The development of a new methodology for visualizing and detecting gases is imperative for various applications. Here, we report a novel strategy in which gas molecules are detected by signals from a reporter guest that can read out a host structural transformation. A composite between a flexible porous coordination polymer and fluorescent reporter distyrylbenzene (DSB) selectively adsorbed CO2 over other atmospheric gases. This adsorption induced a host transformation, which was accompanied by conformational variations of the included DSB. This read-out process resulted in a critical change in DSB fluorescence at a specific threshold pressure. The composite shows different fluorescence responses to CO2 and acetylene, compounds that have similar physicochemical properties. Our system showed, for the first time, that fluorescent molecules can detect gases without any chemical interaction or energy transfer. The host–guest coupled transformations play a pivotal role in converting the gas adsorption events into detectable output signals."
1090,Large variation of vacancy formation energies in the surface of crystalline ice,2011-09-04,"Resolving the atomic structure of the surface of ice particles within clouds, over the temperature range encountered in the atmosphere and relevant to understanding heterogeneous catalysis on ice, remains an experimental challenge. By using first-principles calculations, we show that the surface of crystalline ice exhibits a remarkable variance in vacancy formation energies, akin to an amorphous material. We find vacancy formation energies as low as ~0.1–0.2 eV, which leads to a higher than expected vacancy concentration. Because a vacancy’s reactivity correlates with its formation energy, ice particles may be more reactive than previously thought. We also show that vacancies significantly reduce the formation energy of neighbouring vacancies, thus facilitating pitting and contributing to pre-melting and quasi-liquid layer formation. These surface properties arise from proton disorder and the relaxation of geometric constraints, which suggests that other frustrated materials may possess unusual surface characteristics."
1091,An artificial biomineral formed by incorporation of copolymer micelles in calcite crystals,2011-09-04,"Biominerals exhibit morphologies, hierarchical ordering and properties that invariably surpass those of their synthetic counterparts. A key feature of these materials, which sets them apart from synthetic crystals, is their nanocomposite structure, which derives from intimate association of organic molecules with the mineral host. We here demonstrate the production of artificial biominerals where single crystals of calcite occlude a remarkable 13?wt% of 20?nm anionic diblock copolymer micelles, which act as ‘pseudo-proteins’. The synthetic crystals exhibit analogous texture and defect structures to biogenic calcite crystals and are harder than pure calcite. Further, the micelles are specifically adsorbed on {104} faces and undergo a change in shape on incorporation within the crystal lattice. This system provides a unique model for understanding biomineral formation, giving insight into both the mechanism of occlusion of biomacromolecules within single crystals, and the relationship between the macroscopic mechanical properties of a crystal and its microscopic structure."
1092,Spatially controlled simultaneous patterning of multiple growth factors in three-dimensional hydrogels,2011-08-28,"Three-dimensional (3D) protein-patterned scaffolds provide a more biomimetic environment for cell culture than traditional two-dimensional surfaces, but simultaneous 3D protein patterning has proved difficult. We developed a method to spatially control the immobilization of different growth factors in distinct volumes in 3D hydrogels, and to specifically guide differentiation of stem/progenitor cells therein. Stem-cell differentiation factors sonic hedgehog (SHH) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) were simultaneously immobilized using orthogonal physical binding pairs, barnase–barstar and streptavidin–biotin, respectively. Barnase and streptavidin were sequentially immobilized using two-photon chemistry for subsequent concurrent complexation with fusion proteins barstar–SHH and biotin–CNTF, resulting in bioactive 3D patterned hydrogels. The technique should be broadly applicable to the patterning of a wide range of proteins."
1093,A 3.90 V iron-based fluorosulphate material for lithium-ion batteries crystallizing in the triplite structure,2011-08-21,"Li-ion batteries have empowered consumer electronics and are now seen as the best choice to propel forward the development of eco-friendly (hybrid) electric vehicles. To enhance the energy density, an intensive search has been made for new polyanionic compounds that have a higher potential for the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox couple. Herein we push this potential to 3.90 V in a new polyanionic material that crystallizes in the triplite structure by substituting as little as 5 atomic per cent of Mn for Fe in Li(Fe1−δMnδ)SO4F. Not only is this the highest voltage reported so far for the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox couple, exceeding that of LiFePO4 by 450 mV, but this new triplite phase is capable of reversibly releasing and reinserting 0.7–0.8 Li ions with a volume change of 0.6% (compared with 7 and 10% for LiFePO4 and LiFeSO4F respectively), to give a capacity of ~125 mA h g−1."
1094,Interface-induced room-temperature multiferroicity in BaTiO,2011-08-21,"Multiferroic materials possess two or more ferroic orders but have not been exploited in devices owing to the scarcity of room-temperature examples. Those that are ferromagnetic and ferroelectric have potential applications in multi-state data storage if the ferroic orders switch independently, or in electric-field controlled spintronics if the magnetoelectric coupling is strong. Future applications could also exploit toroidal moments and optical effects that arise from the simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and space-inversion symmetries. Here, we use soft X-ray resonant magnetic scattering and piezoresponse force microscopy to reveal that, at the interface with Fe or Co, ultrathin films of the archetypal ferroelectric BaTiO3 simultaneously possess a magnetization and a polarization that are both spontaneous and hysteretic at room temperature. Ab initio calculations of realistic interface structures provide insight into the origin of the induced moments and bring support to this new approach for creating room-temperature multiferroics."
1095,Probing bulk electronic structure with hard X-ray angle-resolved photoemission,2011-08-14,"Traditional ultraviolet/soft X-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) may in some cases be too strongly influenced by surface effects to be a useful probe of bulk electronic structure. Going to hard X-ray photon energies and thus larger electron inelastic mean-free paths should provide a more accurate picture of bulk electronic structure. We present experimental data for hard X-ray ARPES (HARPES) at energies of 3.2 and 6.0 keV. The systems discussed are W, as a model transition-metal system to illustrate basic principles, and GaAs, as a technologically-relevant material to illustrate the potential broad applicability of this new technique. We have investigated the effects of photon wave vector on wave vector conservation, and assessed methods for the removal of phonon-associated smearing of features and photoelectron diffraction effects. The experimental results are compared to free-electron final-state model calculations and to more precise one-step photoemission theory including matrix element effects."
1096,Highly monodisperse core–shell particles created by solid-state reactions,2011-08-07,"The size distribution of particles, which is essential for many properties of nanomaterials, is equally important for the mechanical behaviour of the class of alloys whose strength derives from a dispersion of nanoscale precipitates. However, particle size distributions formed by solid-state precipitation are generally not well controlled. Here we demonstrate, through the example of core–shell precipitates in Al–Sc–Li alloys, an approach to forming highly monodisperse particle size distributions by simple solid-state reactions. The approach involves the use of a two-step heat treatment, whereby the core formed at high temperature provides a template for growth of the shell at lower temperature. If the core is allowed to grow to a sufficient size, the shell develops in a ‘size focusing’ regime, where smaller particles grow faster than larger ones. These results suggest strategies for manipulating precipitate size distributions in similar systems through simple variations in thermal treatments."
1097,Co,2011-08-07,"Catalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions are at the heart of key renewable-energy technologies including fuel cells and water splitting. Despite tremendous efforts, developing oxygen electrode catalysts with high activity at low cost remains a great challenge. Here, we report a hybrid material consisting of Co3O4 nanocrystals grown on reduced graphene oxide as a high-performance bi-functional catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Although Co3O4 or graphene oxide alone has little catalytic activity, their hybrid exhibits an unexpected, surprisingly high ORR activity that is further enhanced by nitrogen doping of graphene. The Co3O4/N-doped graphene hybrid exhibits similar catalytic activity but superior stability to Pt in alkaline solutions. The same hybrid is also highly active for OER, making it a high-performance non-precious metal-based bi-catalyst for both ORR and OER. The unusual catalytic activity arises from synergetic chemical coupling effects between Co3O4 and graphene."
1098,Sediments of soft spheres arranged by effective density,2011-07-24,"Colloidal sedimentation has been studied for decades from both thermodynamic and dynamic perspectives. In the present work, binary mixtures of colloidal spheres are observed to separate spontaneously into two distinct layers on sedimentation. Both layers have a high volume fraction and contain distinct compositions of particles. Although predicting these compositions using settling dynamics is challenging, here we show that the compositions are readily predicted thermodynamically by minimizing the gravitational energy of the system. As the random packing fraction of a mixture of spheres exceeds that of monodisperse spheres of either type, the mixture produces a denser suspension that forms the bottom phase. Experimentally, the use of charged particles and low-ionic-strength solutions provides interparticle repulsions that keep the packed particles mobile, avoiding a glassy state that would prevent particles from reaching their equilibrium configuration. We extend this work beyond binary systems, showing similar separated layers for a five-component mixture of particles."
1099,Nanoscale surfaces for the long-term maintenance of mesenchymal stem cell phenotype and multipotency,2011-07-17,"There is currently an unmet need for the supply of autologous, patient-specific stem cells for regenerative therapies in the clinic. Mesenchymal stem cell differentiation can be driven by the material/cell interface suggesting a unique strategy to manipulate stem cells in the absence of complex soluble chemistries or cellular reprogramming. However, so far the derivation and identification of surfaces that allow retention of multipotency of this key regenerative cell type have remained elusive. Adult stem cells spontaneously differentiate in culture, resulting in a rapid diminution of the multipotent cell population and their regenerative capacity. Here we identify a nanostructured surface that retains stem-cell phenotype and maintains stem-cell growth over eight weeks. Furthermore, the study implicates a role for small RNAs in repressing key cell signalling and metabolomic pathways, demonstrating the potential of surfaces as non-invasive tools with which to address the stem cell niche."
1100,"A fast, high-endurance and scalable non-volatile memory device made from asymmetric Ta",2011-07-10,"Numerous candidates attempting to replace Si-based flash memory have failed for a variety of reasons over the years. Oxide-based resistance memory and the related memristor have succeeded in surpassing the specifications for a number of device requirements. However, a material or device structure that satisfies high-density, switching-speed, endurance, retention and most importantly power-consumption criteria has yet to be announced. In this work we demonstrate a TaOx-based asymmetric passive switching device with which we were able to localize resistance switching and satisfy all aforementioned requirements. In particular, the reduction of switching current drastically reduces power consumption and results in extreme cycling endurances of over 1012. Along with the 10 ns switching times, this allows for possible applications to the working-memory space as well. Furthermore, by combining two such devices each with an intrinsic Schottky barrier we eliminate any need for a discrete transistor or diode in solving issues of stray leakage current paths in high-density crossbar arrays."
1101,Hybrid elastic solids,2011-06-26,"Metamaterials can exhibit electromagnetic and elastic characteristics beyond those found in nature. In this work, we present a design of elastic metamaterial that exhibits multiple resonances in its building blocks. Band structure calculations show two negative dispersion bands, of which one supports only compressional waves and thereby blurs the distinction between a fluid and a solid over a finite frequency regime, whereas the other displays ‘super anisotropy’ in which compressional waves and shear waves can propagate only along different directions. Such unusual characteristics, well explained by the effective medium theory, have no comparable analogue in conventional solids and may lead to novel applications."
1102, nanocompression testing of irradiated copper,2011-06-26,"Increasing demand for energy and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions has revived interest in nuclear energy. Designing materials for radiation environments necessitates a fundamental understanding of how radiation-induced defects alter mechanical properties. Ion beams create radiation damage efficiently without material activation, but their limited penetration depth requires small-scale testing. However, strength measurements of nanoscale irradiated specimens have not been previously performed. Here we show that yield strengths approaching macroscopic values are measured from irradiated ~400 nm-diameter copper specimens. Quantitative in situ nanocompression testing in a transmission electron microscope reveals that the strength of larger samples is controlled by dislocation–irradiation defect interactions, yielding size-independent strengths. Below ~400 nm, size-dependent strength results from dislocation source limitation. This transition length-scale should be universal, but depends on material and irradiation conditions. We conclude that for irradiated copper, and presumably related materials, nanoscale in situ testing can determine bulk-like yield strengths and simultaneously identify deformation mechanisms."
1103,Atomic layer-deposited tunnel oxide stabilizes silicon photoanodes for water oxidation,2011-06-19,"A leading approach for large-scale electrochemical energy production with minimal global-warming gas emission is to use a renewable source of electricity, such as solar energy, to oxidize water, providing the abundant source of electrons needed in fuel synthesis. We report corrosion-resistant, nanocomposite anodes for the oxidation of water required to produce renewable fuels. Silicon, an earth-abundant element and an efficient photovoltaic material, is protected by atomic layer deposition (ALD) of a highly uniform, 2 nm thick layer of titanium dioxide (TiO2) and then coated with an optically transmitting layer of a known catalyst (3 nm iridium). Photoelectrochemical water oxidation was observed to occur below the reversible potential whereas dark electrochemical water oxidation was found to have low-to-moderate overpotentials at all pH values, resulting in an inferred photovoltage of ~550 mV. Water oxidation is sustained at these anodes for many hours in harsh pH and oxidative environments whereas comparable silicon anodes without the TiO2 coating quickly fail. The desirable electrochemical efficiency and corrosion resistance of these anodes is made possible by the low electron-tunnelling resistance (<0.006 Ω cm2 for p+-Si) and uniform thickness of atomic-layer deposited TiO2."
1104,Giant Rashba-type spin splitting in bulk BiTeI,2011-06-19,"There has been increasing interest in phenomena emerging from relativistic electrons in a solid, which have a potential impact on spintronics and magnetoelectrics. One example is the Rashba effect, which lifts the electron-spin degeneracy as a consequence of spin–orbit interaction under broken inversion symmetry. A high-energy-scale Rashba spin splitting is highly desirable for enhancing the coupling between electron spins and electricity relevant for spintronic functions. Here we describe the finding of a huge spin–orbit interaction effect in a polar semiconductor composed of heavy elements, BiTeI, where the bulk carriers are ruled by large Rashba-like spin splitting. The band splitting and its spin polarization obtained by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy are well in accord with relativistic first-principles calculations, confirming that the spin splitting is indeed derived from bulk atomic configurations. Together with the feasibility of carrier-doping control, the giant-Rashba semiconductor BiTeI possesses excellent potential for application to various spin-dependent electronic functions."
1105,Nanoparticles that communicate ,2011-06-19,"Nanomedicines have enormous potential to improve the precision of cancer therapy, yet our ability to efficiently home these materials to regions of disease in vivo remains very limited. Inspired by the ability of communication to improve targeting in biological systems, such as inflammatory-cell recruitment to sites of disease, we construct systems where synthetic biological and nanotechnological components communicate to amplify disease targeting in vivo. These systems are composed of ‘signalling’ modules (nanoparticles or engineered proteins) that target tumours and then locally activate the coagulation cascade to broadcast tumour location to clot-targeted ‘receiving’ nanoparticles in circulation that carry a diagnostic or therapeutic cargo, thereby amplifying their delivery. We show that communicating nanoparticle systems can be composed of multiple types of signalling and receiving modules, can transmit information through multiple molecular pathways in coagulation, can operate autonomously and can target over 40 times higher doses of chemotherapeutics to tumours than non-communicating controls."
1106,Giant enhancement of spin accumulation and long-distance spin precession in metallic lateral spin valves,2011-06-12,"The non-local spin injection in lateral spin valves is strongly expected to be an effective method to generate a pure spin current for potential spintronic application. However, the spin-valve voltage, which determines the magnitude of the spin current flowing into an additional ferromagnetic wire, is typically of the order of 1 μV. Here we show that lateral spin valves with low-resistivity NiFe/MgO/Ag junctions enable efficient spin injection with high applied current density, which leads to the spin-valve voltage increasing 100-fold. Hanle effect measurements demonstrate a long-distance collective 2π spin precession along a 6-μm-long Ag wire. These results suggest a route to faster and manipulable spin transport for the development of pure spin-current-based memory, logic and sensing devices."
1107,Giant anharmonic phonon scattering in PbTe,2011-06-05,"Understanding the microscopic processes affecting the bulk thermal conductivity is crucial to develop more efficient thermoelectric materials. PbTe is currently one of the leading thermoelectric materials, largely thanks to its low thermal conductivity. However, the origin of this low thermal conductivity in a simple rocksalt structure has so far been elusive. Using a combination of inelastic neutron scattering measurements and first-principles computations of the phonons, we identify a strong anharmonic coupling between the ferroelectric transverse optic mode and the longitudinal acoustic modes in PbTe. This interaction extends over a large portion of reciprocal space, and directly affects the heat-carrying longitudinal acoustic phonons. The longitudinal acoustic–transverse optic anharmonic coupling is likely to play a central role in explaining the low thermal conductivity of PbTe. The present results provide a microscopic picture of why many good thermoelectric materials are found near a lattice instability of the ferroelectric type."
1108,Structural origin of enhanced slow dynamics near a wall in glass-forming systems,2011-05-29,"Spatial confinement is known to induce a drastic change in the viscosity, relaxation times, and flow profile of liquids near the glass (or jamming) transition point. The essential underlying question is how a wall affects the dynamics of densely packed systems. Here we study this fundamental problem, using experiments on a driven granular hard-sphere liquid and numerical simulations of polydisperse and bidisperse colloidal liquids. The nearly hard-core nature of the particle–wall interaction provides an ideal opportunity to study purely geometrical confinement effects. We reveal that the slower dynamics near a wall is induced by wall-induced enhancement of ‘glassy structural order’, which is a manifestation of strong interparticle correlations. By generalizing the structure-dynamics relation for bulk systems, we find a quantitative relation between the structural relaxation time at a certain distance from a wall and the correlation length of glassy structural order there. Our finding suggests that glassy structural ordering may be the origin of the slow glassy dynamics of a supercooled liquid."
1109,Collective cell guidance by cooperative intercellular forces,2011-05-22,"Cells comprising a tissue migrate as part of a collective. How collective processes are coordinated over large multi-cellular assemblies has remained unclear, however, because mechanical stresses exerted at cell–cell junctions have not been accessible experimentally. We report here maps of these stresses within and between cells comprising a monolayer. Within the cell sheet there arise unanticipated fluctuations of mechanical stress that are severe, emerge spontaneously, and ripple across the monolayer. Within that stress landscape, local cellular migrations follow local orientations of maximal principal stress. Migrations of both endothelial and epithelial monolayers conform to this behaviour, as do breast cancer cell lines before but not after the epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Collective migration in these diverse systems is seen to be governed by a simple but unifying physiological principle: neighbouring cells join forces to transmit appreciable normal stress across the cell–cell junction, but migrate along orientations of minimal intercellular shear stress."
1110,Local elastic properties of a metallic glass,2011-05-22,"The nature of non-crystalline materials causes the local potential energy of a cluster of atoms or molecules to vary significantly in space. Different configurations of an ensemble of atoms in a metallic glass lead therefore to a distribution of elastic constants which also changes in space. This is totally different to their crystalline counterparts, where a long-range order exists in space and therefore a much more unified elastic modulus is expected. Using atomic force acoustic microscopy, we present data which show that the local so-called indentation modulus M indeed exhibits a wide distribution on a scale below 10 nm in amorphous PdCuSi, with Δ M/M≈30%. About 104 atoms are probed in an individual measurement. Crystallized PdCuSi shows a variation that is 10–30 times smaller and which is determined by the resolution of the microscope and by the polycrystalline structure of the material."
1111,Nanoantenna-enhanced gas sensing in a single tailored nanofocus,2011-05-15,"Metallic nanostructures possess plasmonic resonances that spatially confine light on the nanometre scale. In the ultimate limit of a single nanostructure, the electromagnetic field can be strongly concentrated in a volume of only a few hundred nm3 or less. This optical nanofocus is ideal for plasmonic sensing. Any object that is brought into this single spot will influence the optical nanostructure resonance with its dielectric properties. Here, we demonstrate antenna-enhanced hydrogen sensing at the single-particle level. We place a single palladium nanoparticle near the tip region of a gold nanoantenna and detect the changing optical properties of the system on hydrogen exposure by dark-field microscopy. Our method avoids any inhomogeneous broadening and statistical effects that would occur in sensors based on nanoparticle ensembles. Our concept paves the road towards the observation of single catalytic processes in nanoreactors and biosensing on the single-molecule level."
1112,Tailoring organic heterojunction interfaces in bilayer polymer photovoltaic devices,2011-05-15,"In an ideal model, a p–n junction is formed by two stacked slabs of semiconductors. Although the construction of actual devices is generally more complex, we show that such a simple method can in fact be applied to the formation of organic heterojunctions. Two films of the organic semiconductors poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) can be connected by a simple film-transfer method without disturbing their flat surfaces. Each film can further be modified with a surface-segregated monolayer to tune the strength and direction of the surface dipole moment. Using this method, we fabricated bilayer organic photovoltaic devices with interfacial dipole moments that were selected to align the energy levels at the heterojunction. The open-circuit voltages of the P3HT/PCBM devices could be tuned over a wide range between 0.3 and 0.95 V, indicating that, even if the same combination of bulk materials is used, the interfacial properties drastically alter the performance of organic photovoltaic devices."
1113,Highly active oxide photocathode for photoelectrochemical water reduction,2011-05-08,"A clean and efficient way to overcome the limited supply of fossil fuels and the greenhouse effect is the production of hydrogen fuel from sunlight and water through the semiconductor/water junction of a photoelectrochemical cell, where energy collection and water electrolysis are combined into a single semiconductor electrode. We present a highly active photocathode for solar H2 production, consisting of electrodeposited cuprous oxide, which was protected against photocathodic decomposition in water by nanolayers of Al-doped zinc oxide and titanium oxide and activated for hydrogen evolution with electrodeposited Pt nanoparticles. The roles of the different surface protection components were investigated, and in the best case electrodes showed photocurrents of up to −7.6 mA cm−2 at a potential of 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode at mild pH. The electrodes remained active after 1 h of testing, cuprous oxide was found to be stable during the water reduction reaction and the Faradaic efficiency was estimated to be close to 100%."
1114,Control and characterization of individual grains and grain boundaries in graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition,2011-05-08,"The strong interest in graphene has motivated the scalable production of high-quality graphene and graphene devices. As the large-scale graphene films synthesized so far are typically polycrystalline, it is important to characterize and control grain boundaries, generally believed to degrade graphene quality. Here we study single-crystal graphene grains synthesized by ambient chemical vapour deposition on polycrystalline Cu, and show how individual boundaries between coalescing grains affect graphene’s electronic properties. The graphene grains show no definite epitaxial relationship with the Cu substrate, and can cross Cu grain boundaries. The edges of these grains are found to be predominantly parallel to zigzag directions. We show that grain boundaries give a significant Raman ‘D’ peak, impede electrical transport, and induce prominent weak localization indicative of intervalley scattering in graphene. Finally, we demonstrate an approach using pre-patterned growth seeds to control graphene nucleation, opening a route towards scalable fabrication of single-crystal graphene devices without grain boundaries."
1115,High-performance flat-panel solar thermoelectric generators with high thermal concentration,2011-05-01,"The conversion of sunlight into electricity has been dominated by photovoltaic and solar thermal power generation. Photovoltaic cells are deployed widely, mostly as flat panels, whereas solar thermal electricity generation relying on optical concentrators and mechanical heat engines is only seen in large-scale power plants. Here we demonstrate a promising flat-panel solar thermal to electric power conversion technology based on the Seebeck effect and high thermal concentration, thus enabling wider applications. The developed solar thermoelectric generators (STEGs) achieved a peak efficiency of 4.6% under AM1.5G (1 kW m−2) conditions. The efficiency is 7–8 times higher than the previously reported best value for a flat-panel STEG, and is enabled by the use of high-performance nanostructured thermoelectric materials and spectrally-selective solar absorbers in an innovative design that exploits high thermal concentration in an evacuated environment. Our work opens up a promising new approach which has the potential to achieve cost-effective conversion of solar energy into electricity."
1116,Structure formation in active networks,2011-04-24,"Structure formation and constant reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton are key requirements for the function of living cells. Here we show that a minimal reconstituted system consisting of actin filaments, crosslinking molecules and molecular-motor filaments exhibits a generic mechanism of structure formation, characterized by a broad distribution of cluster sizes. We demonstrate that the growth of the structures depends on the intricate balance between crosslinker-induced stabilization and simultaneous destabilization by molecular motors, a mechanism analogous to nucleation and growth in passive systems. We also show that the intricate interplay between force generation, coarsening and connectivity is responsible for the highly dynamic process of structure formation in this heterogeneous active gel, and that these competing mechanisms result in anomalous transport, reminiscent of intracellular dynamics."
1117,Low-temperature fabrication of high-performance metal oxide thin-film electronics via combustion processing,2011-04-17,"The development of large-area, low-cost electronics for flat-panel displays, sensor arrays, and flexible circuitry depends heavily on high-throughput fabrication processes and a choice of materials with appropriate performance characteristics. For different applications, high charge carrier mobility, high electrical conductivity, large dielectric constants, mechanical flexibility or optical transparency may be required. Although thin films of metal oxides could potentially meet all of these needs, at present they are deposited using slow and equipment-intensive techniques such as sputtering. Recently, solution processing schemes with high throughput have been developed, but these require high annealing temperatures (Tanneal>400 °C), which are incompatible with flexible polymeric substrates. Here we report combustion processing as a new general route to solution growth of diverse electronic metal oxide films (In2O3, a-Zn–Sn–O, a-In–Zn–O, ITO) at temperatures as low as 200 °C. We show that this method can be implemented to fabricate high-performance, optically transparent transistors on flexible plastic substrates."
1118,Nanofibrous hollow microspheres self-assembled from star-shaped polymers as injectable cell carriers for knee repair,2011-04-17,"To repair complexly shaped tissue defects, an injectable cell carrier is desirable to achieve an accurate fit and to minimize surgical intervention. However, the injectable carriers available at present have limitations, and are not used clinically for cartilage regeneration. Here, we report nanofibrous hollow microspheres self-assembled from star-shaped biodegradable polymers as an injectable cell carrier. The nanofibrous hollow microspheres, integrating the extracellular-matrix-mimicking architecture with a highly porous injectable form, were shown to efficiently accommodate cells and enhance cartilage regeneration, compared with control microspheres. The nanofibrous hollow microspheres also supported a significantly larger amount of, and higher-quality, cartilage regeneration than the chondrocytes-alone group in an ectopic implantation model. In a critical-size rabbit osteochondral defect-repair model, the nanofibrous hollow microspheres/chondrocytes group achieved substantially better cartilage repair than the chondrocytes-alone group that simulates the clinically available autologous chondrocyte implantation procedure. These results indicate that the nanofibrous hollow microspheres are an excellent injectable cell carrier for cartilage regeneration."
1119,The targeted delivery of multicomponent cargos to cancer cells by nanoporous particle-supported lipid bilayers,2011-04-17,"Encapsulation of drugs within nanocarriers that selectively target malignant cells promises to mitigate side effects of conventional chemotherapy and to enable delivery of the unique drug combinations needed for personalized medicine. To realize this potential, however, targeted nanocarriers must simultaneously overcome multiple challenges, including specificity, stability and a high capacity for disparate cargos. Here we report porous nanoparticle-supported lipid bilayers (protocells) that synergistically combine properties of liposomes and nanoporous particles. Protocells modified with a targeting peptide that binds to human hepatocellular carcinoma exhibit a 10,000-fold greater affinity for human hepatocellular carcinoma than for hepatocytes, endothelial cells or immune cells. Furthermore, protocells can be loaded with combinations of therapeutic (drugs, small interfering RNA and toxins) and diagnostic (quantum dots) agents and modified to promote endosomal escape and nuclear accumulation of selected cargos. The enormous capacity of the high-surface-area nanoporous core combined with the enhanced targeting efficacy enabled by the fluid supported lipid bilayer enable a single protocell loaded with a drug cocktail to kill a drug-resistant human hepatocellular carcinoma cell, representing a 106-fold improvement over comparable liposomes."
1120,Rotation-reversal symmetries in crystals and handed structures,2011-04-03,"Symmetry is a powerful framework to perceive and predict the physical world. The structure of materials is described by a combination of rotations, rotation-inversions and translational symmetries. By recognizing the reversal of static structural rotations between clockwise and counterclockwise directions as a distinct symmetry operation, here we show that there are many more structural symmetries than are currently recognized in right- or left-handed helices, spirals, and in antidistorted structures composed equally of rotations of both handedness. For example, we show that many antidistorted perovskites possess twice the number of symmetry elements as conventionally identified. These new ‘roto’ symmetries predict new forms for ‘roto’ properties that relate to static rotations, such as rotoelectricity, piezorotation, and rotomagnetism. They enable a symmetry-based search for new phenomena, such as multiferroicity involving a coupling of spins, electric polarization and static rotations. This work is relevant to structure–property relationships in all materials and structures with static rotations."
1121,Support nanostructure boosts oxygen transfer to catalytically active platinum nanoparticles,2011-03-20,"Interactions of metal particles with oxide supports can radically enhance the performance of supported catalysts. At the microscopic level, the details of such metal–oxide interactions usually remain obscure. This study identifies two types of oxidative metal–oxide interaction on well-defined models of technologically important Pt–ceria catalysts: (1) electron transfer from the Pt nanoparticle to the support, and (2) oxygen transfer from ceria to Pt. The electron transfer is favourable on ceria supports, irrespective of their morphology. Remarkably, the oxygen transfer is shown to require the presence of nanostructured ceria in close contact with Pt and, thus, is inherently a nanoscale effect. Our findings enable us to detail the formation mechanism of the catalytically indispensable Pt–O species on ceria and to elucidate the extraordinary structure–activity dependence of ceria-based catalysts in general."
1122,Memory and topological frustration in nematic liquid crystals confined in porous materials,2011-03-20,"Orientational ordering is key to functional materials with switching capability, such as nematic liquid crystals and ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials. We explored the confinement of nematic liquid crystals in bicontinuous porous structures with smooth surfaces that locally impose normal orientational order on the liquid crystal. We find that frustration leads to a high density of topological defect lines permeating the porous structures, and that most defect lines are made stable by looping around solid portions of the confining material. Because many defect trajectories are possible, these systems are highly metastable and efficient in memorizing the alignment forced by external fields. Such memory effects have their origin in the topology of the confining surface and are maximized in a simple periodic bicontinuous cubic structure. We also show that nematic liquid crystals in random porous networks exhibit a disorder-induced slowing-down typical of glasses that originates from activated collisions and rearrangements of defect lines. Our findings offer the possibility to functionalize orientationally ordered materials through topological confinement."
1123,Porphysome nanovesicles generated by porphyrin bilayers for use as multimodal biophotonic contrast agents,2011-03-20,"Optically active nanomaterials promise to advance a range of biophotonic techniques through nanoscale optical effects and integration of multiple imaging and therapeutic modalities. Here, we report the development of porphysomes; nanovesicles formed from self-assembled porphyrin bilayers that generated large, tunable extinction coefficients, structure-dependent fluorescence self-quenching and unique photothermal and photoacoustic properties. Porphysomes enabled the sensitive visualization of lymphatic systems using photoacoustic tomography. Near-infrared fluorescence generation could be restored on dissociation, creating opportunities for low-background fluorescence imaging. As a result of their organic nature, porphysomes were enzymatically biodegradable and induced minimal acute toxicity in mice with intravenous doses of 1,000 mg kg−1. In a similar manner to liposomes, the large aqueous core of porphysomes could be passively or actively loaded. Following systemic administration, porphysomes accumulated in tumours of xenograft-bearing mice and laser irradiation induced photothermal tumour ablation. The optical properties and biocompatibility of porphysomes demonstrate the multimodal potential of organic nanoparticles for biophotonic imaging and therapy."
1124,Materials for multifunctional balloon catheters with capabilities in cardiac electrophysiological mapping and ablation therapy,2011-03-06,"Developing advanced surgical tools for minimally invasive procedures represents an activity of central importance to improving human health. A key challenge is in establishing biocompatible interfaces between the classes of semiconductor device and sensor technologies that might be most useful in this context and the soft, curvilinear surfaces of the body. This paper describes a solution based on materials that integrate directly with the thin elastic membranes of otherwise conventional balloon catheters, to provide diverse, multimodal functionality suitable for clinical use. As examples, we present sensors for measuring temperature, flow, tactile, optical and electrophysiological data, together with radiofrequency electrodes for controlled, local ablation of tissue. Use of such ‘instrumented’ balloon catheters in live animal models illustrates their operation, as well as their specific utility in cardiac ablation therapy. The same concepts can be applied to other substrates of interest, such as surgical gloves."
1125,Interbilayer-crosslinked multilamellar vesicles as synthetic vaccines for potent humoral and cellular immune responses,2011-02-20,"Vaccines based on recombinant proteins avoid the toxicity and antivector immunity associated with live vaccine (for example, viral) vectors, but their immunogenicity is poor, particularly for CD8+ T-cell responses. Synthetic particles carrying antigens and adjuvant molecules have been developed to enhance subunit vaccines, but in general these materials have failed to elicit CD8+ T-cell responses comparable to those for live vectors in preclinical animal models. Here, we describe interbilayer-crosslinked multilamellar vesicles formed by crosslinking headgroups of adjacent lipid bilayers within multilamellar vesicles. Interbilayer-crosslinked vesicles stably entrapped protein antigens in the vesicle core and lipid-based immunostimulatory molecules in the vesicle walls under extracellular conditions, but exhibited rapid release in the presence of endolysosomal lipases. We found that these antigen/adjuvant-carrying vesicles form an extremely potent whole-protein vaccine, eliciting endogenous T-cell and antibody responses comparable to those for the strongest vaccine vectors. These materials should enable a range of subunit vaccines and provide new possibilities for therapeutic protein delivery."
1126,Mesophase behaviour of polyhedral particles,2011-02-13,"Translational and orientational excluded-volume fields encoded in particles with anisotropic shapes can lead to purely entropy-driven assembly of morphologies with specific order and symmetry. To elucidate this complex correlation, we carried out detailed Monte Carlo simulations of six convex space-filling polyhedrons, namely, truncated octahedrons, rhombic dodecahedrons, hexagonal prisms, cubes, gyrobifastigiums and triangular prisms. Simulations predict the formation of various new liquid-crystalline and plastic-crystalline phases at intermediate volume fractions. By correlating these findings with particle anisotropy and rotational symmetry, simple guidelines for predicting phase behaviour of polyhedral particles are proposed: high rotational symmetry is in general conducive to mesophase formation, with low anisotropy favouring plastic-solid behaviour and intermediate anisotropy (or high uniaxial anisotropy) favouring liquid-crystalline behaviour. It is also found that dynamical disorder is crucial in defining mesophase behaviour, and that the apparent kinetic barrier for the liquid–mesophase transition is much lower for liquid crystals (orientational order) than for plastic solids (translational order)."
1127,Efficiency enhancement in organic solar cells with ferroelectric polymers,2011-02-13,"The recombination of electrons and holes in semiconducting polymer–fullerene blends has been identified as a main cause of energy loss in organic photovoltaic devices. Generally, an external bias voltage is required to efficiently separate the electrons and holes and thus prevent their recombination. Here we show that a large, permanent, internal electric field can be ensured by incorporating a ferroelectric polymer layer into the device, which eliminates the need for an external bias. The electric field, of the order of 50 V μm−1, potentially induced by the ferroelectric layer is tens of times larger than that achievable by the use of electrodes with different work functions. We show that ferroelectric polymer layers enhanced the efficiency of several types of organic photovoltaic device from 1–2% without layers to 4–5% with layers. These enhanced efficiencies are 10–20% higher than those achieved by other methods, such as morphology and electrode work-function optimization. The devices show the unique characteristics of ferroelectric photovoltaic devices with switchable diode polarity and tunable efficiency."
1128,The lithium intercalation process in the low-voltage lithium battery anode Li,2011-02-13,"Lithium can be reversibly intercalated into layered Li1+xV1−xO2 (LiCoO2 structure) at ∼0.1 V, but only if x>0. The low voltage combined with a higher density than graphite results in a higher theoretical volumetric energy density; important for future applications in portable electronics and electric vehicles. Here we investigate the crucial question, why Li cannot intercalate into LiVO2 but Li-rich compositions switch on intercalation at an unprecedented low voltage for an oxide? We show that Li+ intercalated into tetrahedral sites are energetically more stable for Li-rich compositions, as they share a face with Li+ on the V site in the transition metal layers. Li incorporation triggers shearing of the oxide layers from cubic to hexagonal packing because the Li2VO2 structure can accommodate two Li per formula unit in tetrahedral sites without face sharing. Such understanding is important for the future design and optimization of low-voltage intercalation anodes for lithium batteries."
1129,An octave-bandwidth negligible-loss radiofrequency metamaterial,2011-01-30,"Metamaterials provide an unprecedented ability to manipulate electromagnetic waves and are an enabling technology for new devices ranging from flat lenses that focus light beyond the diffraction limit to coatings capable of cloaking an object. Nevertheless, narrow bandwidths and high intrinsic losses arising from the resonant properties of metamaterials have raised doubts about their usefulness. New design approaches seek to turn the perceived disadvantages of dispersion into assets that enhance a device’s performance. Here we employ dispersion engineering of metamaterial properties to enable specific device performance over usable bandwidths. In particular, we design metamaterials that considerably improve conventional horn antennas over greater than an octave bandwidth with negligible loss and advance the state of the art in the process. Fabrication and measurement of a metahorn confirm its broadband, low-loss performance. This example illustrates the power of clever implementation combined with dispersion engineering to bring metamaterials into their full potential for revolutionizing practical devices."
1130,A highly parallel method for synthesizing DNA repeats enables the discovery of ‘smart’ protein polymers,2011-01-23,"Robust high-throughput synthesis methods are needed to expand the repertoire of repetitive protein-polymers for different applications. To address this need, we developed a new method, overlap extension rolling circle amplification (OERCA), for the highly parallel synthesis of genes encoding repetitive protein-polymers. OERCA involves a single PCR-type reaction for the rolling circle amplification of a circular DNA template and simultaneous overlap extension by thermal cycling. We characterized the variables that control OERCA and demonstrated its superiority over existing methods, its robustness, high-throughput and versatility by synthesizing variants of elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) and protease-responsive polymers of glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues. Despite the GC-rich, highly repetitive sequences of ELPs, we synthesized remarkably large genes without recursive ligation. OERCA also enabled us to discover ‘smart’ biopolymers that exhibit fully reversible thermally responsive behaviour. This powerful strategy generates libraries of repetitive genes over a wide and tunable range of molecular weights in a ‘one-pot’ parallel format."
1131,Ultralow-voltage field-ionization discharge on whiskered silicon nanowires for gas-sensing applications,2011-01-16,"Several hundred million volts per centimetre of electric-field strength are required to field-ionize gas species. Such fields are produced on sharp metallic tips under a bias of a few kilovolts. Here, we show that field ionization is possible at dramatically lower fields on semiconductor nanomaterials containing surface states, particularly with metal-catalysed whiskers grown on silicon nanowires. The low-voltage field-ionization phenomena observed here cannot be explained solely on the basis of the large field-amplification effect of suspended gold nanoparticles present on the whisker tips. We postulate that field penetration causes upward band-bending at the surface of exposed silicon containing surface states in the vicinity of the catalyst. Band-bending enables the valence electron to tunnel into the surface states at reduced fields. This work provides a basis for development of low-voltage ionization sensors. Although demonstrated on silicon, low-voltage field ionization can be detected on any sharp semiconductor tip containing proper surface states."
1132,Experimental analysis of charge redistribution due to chemical bonding by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy,2011-01-16,"The electronic charge density distribution or the electrostatic atomic potential of a solid or molecule contains information not only on the atomic structure, but also on the electronic properties, such as the nature of the chemical bonds or the degree of ionization of atoms. However, the redistribution of charge due to chemical bonding is small compared with the total charge density, and therefore difficult to measure. Here, we demonstrate an experimental analysis of charge redistribution due to chemical bonding by means of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). We analyse charge transfer on the single-atom level for nitrogen-substitution point defects in graphene, and confirm the ionicity of single-layer hexagonal boron nitride. Our combination of HRTEM experiments and first-principles electronic structure calculations opens a new way to investigate electronic configurations of point defects, other non-periodic arrangements or nanoscale objects that cannot be studied by an electron or X-ray diffraction analysis."
1133,A damage-tolerant glass,2011-01-09,"Owing to a lack of microstructure, glassy materials are inherently strong but brittle, and often demonstrate extreme sensitivity to flaws. Accordingly, their macroscopic failure is often not initiated by plastic yielding, and almost always terminated by brittle fracture. Unlike conventional brittle glasses, metallic glasses are generally capable of limited plastic yielding by shear-band sliding in the presence of a flaw, and thus exhibit toughness–strength relationships that lie between those of brittle ceramics and marginally tough metals. Here, a bulk glassy palladium alloy is introduced, demonstrating an unusual capacity for shielding an opening crack accommodated by an extensive shear-band sliding process, which promotes a fracture toughness comparable to those of the toughest materials known. This result demonstrates that the combination of toughness and strength (that is, damage tolerance) accessible to amorphous materials extends beyond the benchmark ranges established by the toughest and strongest materials known, thereby pushing the envelope of damage tolerance accessible to a structural metal."
1134,From local structure to nanosecond recrystallization dynamics in AgInSbTe phase-change materials,2011-01-09,"Phase-change optical memories are based on the astonishingly rapid nanosecond-scale crystallization of nanosized amorphous ‘marks’ in a polycrystalline layer. Models of crystallization exist for the commercially used phase-change alloy Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST), but not for the equally important class of Sb–Te-based alloys. We have combined X-ray diffraction, extended X-ray absorption fine structure and hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments with density functional simulations to determine the crystalline and amorphous structures of Ag3.5In3.8Sb75.0Te17.7 (AIST) and how they differ from GST. The structure of amorphous (a-) AIST shows a range of atomic ring sizes, whereas a-GST shows mainly small rings and cavities. The local environment of Sb in both forms of AIST is a distorted 3+3 octahedron. These structures suggest a bond-interchange model, where a sequence of small displacements of Sb atoms accompanied by interchanges of short and long bonds is the origin of the rapid crystallization of a-AIST. It differs profoundly from crystallization in a-GST."
1135,Slow dynamics and internal stress relaxation in bundled cytoskeletal networks,2011-01-09,"Crosslinked and bundled actin filaments form networks that are essential for the mechanical properties of living cells. Reconstituted actin networks have been extensively studied not only as a model system for the cytoskeleton, but also to understand the interplay between microscopic structure and macroscopic viscoelastic properties of network-forming soft materials. These constitute a broad class of materials with countless applications in science and industry. So far, it has been widely assumed that reconstituted actin networks represent equilibrium structures. Here, we show that fully polymerized actin/fascin bundle networks exhibit surprising age-dependent changes in their viscoelastic properties and spontaneous dynamics, a feature strongly reminiscent of out-of-equilibrium, or glassy, soft materials. Using a combination of rheology, confocal microscopy and space-resolved dynamic light scattering, we demonstrate that actin networks build up stress during their formation and then slowly relax towards equilibrium owing to the unbinding dynamics of the crosslinking molecules."
1136,Disorder-induced localization in crystalline phase-change materials,2011-01-09,"Localization of charge carriers in crystalline solids has been the subject of numerous investigations over more than half a century. Materials that show a metal–insulator transition without a structural change are therefore of interest. Mechanisms leading to metal–insulator transition include electron correlation (Mott transition) or disorder (Anderson localization), but a clear distinction is difficult. Here we report on a metal–insulator transition on increasing annealing temperature for a group of crystalline phase-change materials, where the metal–insulator transition is due to strong disorder usually associated only with amorphous solids. With pronounced disorder but weak electron correlation, these phase-change materials form an unparalleled quantum state of matter. Their universal electronic behaviour seems to be at the origin of the remarkable reproducibility of the resistance switching that is crucial to their applications in non-volatile-memory devices. Controlling the degree of disorder in crystalline phase-change materials might enable multilevel resistance states in upcoming storage devices."
1137,A polycationic antimicrobial and biocompatible hydrogel with microbe membrane suctioning ability,2010-12-12,"Despite advanced sterilization and aseptic techniques, infections associated with medical implants have not been eradicated. Most present coatings cannot simultaneously fulfil the requirements of antibacterial and antifungal activity as well as biocompatibility and reusability. Here, we report an antimicrobial hydrogel based on dimethyldecylammonium chitosan (with high quaternization)-graft-poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (DMDC-Q-g-EM) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate, which has excellent antimicrobial efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Fusarium solani. The proposed mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of the polycationic hydrogel is by attraction of sections of anionic microbial membrane into the internal nanopores of the hydrogel, like an ‘anion sponge’, leading to microbial membrane disruption and then microbe death. We have also demonstrated a thin uniform adherent coating of the hydrogel by simple ultraviolet immobilization. An animal study shows that DMDC-Q-g-EM hydrogel coating is biocompatible with rabbit conjunctiva and has no toxicity to the epithelial cells or the underlying stroma."
1138,Electrochemical investigation of the P2–Na,2010-12-12,"Sodium layered oxides NaxCoO2 form one of the most fascinating low-dimensional and strongly correlated systems; in particular P2–NaxCoO2 exhibits various single-phase domains with different Na+/vacancy patterns depending on the sodium concentration. Here we used sodium batteries to clearly depict the P2–NaxCoO2 phase diagram for x≥0.50. By coupling the electrochemical process with an in situ X-ray diffraction experiment, we identified the succession of single-phase or two-phase domains appearing on sodium intercalation with a rather good accuracy compared with previous studies. We reported new single-phase domains and we underlined the thermal instability of some ordered phases from an electrochemical study at various temperatures. As each phase is characterized by the position of its Fermi level versus the Na+/Na couple, we showed that the synthesis of each material, even in large amounts, can be carried out electrochemically. The physical properties of the as-prepared Na1/2CoO2 and Na2/3CoO2 ordered phases were characterized and compared. Electrochemical processes are confirmed to be an accurate route to precisely investigate in a continuous way such a complex system and provide a new way to synthesize materials with a very narrow existence range."
1139,Flexible organic transistors and circuits with extreme bending stability,2010-11-07,"Flexible electronic circuits are an essential prerequisite for the development of rollable displays, conformable sensors, biodegradable electronics and other applications with unconventional form factors. The smallest radius into which a circuit can be bent is typically several millimetres, limited by strain-induced damage to the active circuit elements. Bending-induced damage can be avoided by placing the circuit elements on rigid islands connected by stretchable wires, but the presence of rigid areas within the substrate plane limits the bending radius. Here we demonstrate organic transistors and complementary circuits that continue to operate without degradation while being folded into a radius of 100 μm. This enormous flexibility and bending stability is enabled by a very thin plastic substrate (12.5 μm), an atomically smooth planarization coating and a hybrid encapsulation stack that places the transistors in the neutral strain position. We demonstrate a potential application as a catheter with a sheet of transistors and sensors wrapped around it that enables the spatially resolved measurement of physical or chemical properties inside long, narrow tubes."
1140,Waterproof AlInGaP optoelectronics on stretchable substrates with applications in biomedicine and robotics,2010-10-17,"Inorganic light-emitting diodes and photodetectors represent important, established technologies for solid-state lighting, digital imaging and many other applications. Eliminating mechanical and geometrical design constraints imposed by the supporting semiconductor wafers can enable alternative uses in areas such as biomedicine and robotics. Here we describe systems that consist of arrays of interconnected, ultrathin inorganic light-emitting diodes and photodetectors configured in mechanically optimized layouts on unusual substrates. Light-emitting sutures, implantable sheets and illuminated plasmonic crystals that are compatible with complete immersion in biofluids illustrate the suitability of these technologies for use in biomedicine. Waterproof optical-proximity-sensor tapes capable of conformal integration on curved surfaces of gloves and thin, refractive-index monitors wrapped on tubing for intravenous delivery systems demonstrate possibilities in robotics and clinical medicine. These and related systems may create important, unconventional opportunities for optoelectronic devices."
1141,An engineered anisotropic nanofilm with unidirectional wetting properties,2010-10-10,"Anisotropic textured surfaces allow water striders to walk on water, butterflies to shed water from their wings and plants to trap insects and pollen. Capturing these natural features in biomimetic surfaces is an active area of research. Here, we report an engineered nanofilm, composed of an array of poly(p-xylylene) nanorods, which demonstrates anisotropic wetting behaviour by means of a pin-release droplet ratchet mechanism. Droplet retention forces in the pin and release directions differ by up to 80 μN, which is over ten times greater than the values reported for other engineered anisotropic surfaces. The nanofilm provides a microscale smooth surface on which to transport microlitre droplets, and is also relatively easy to synthesize by a bottom-up vapour-phase technique. An accompanying comprehensive model successfully describes the film’s anisotropic wetting behaviour as a function of measurable film morphology parameters."
1142,Observation of long-range exciton diffusion in highly ordered organic semiconductors,2010-10-10,"Excitons in polycrystalline and disordered films of organic semiconductors have been shown to diffuse over distances of 10–50 nm. Here, using polarization- and wavelength-dependent photoconductivity in the highly ordered organic semiconductor rubrene, we show that the diffusion of triplet excitons in this material occurs over macroscopic distances (2–8 μm), comparable to the light absorption length. Dissociation of these excitons at the surface of the crystal is found to be the main source of photoconductivity in rubrene. In addition, we observe strong photoluminescence quenching and a simultaneous enhancement of photoconductivity when the crystal surface is functionalized with exciton splitters. In combination with time-resolved measurements, these observations strongly suggest that long-lived triplet excitons are indeed generated in molecular crystals by fission of singlets, and these triplets provide a significant contribution to the surface photocurrent generated in organic materials. Our findings indicate that the exciton diffusion bottleneck is not an intrinsic limitation of organic semiconductors."
1143,Measuring fundamental properties in operating solid oxide electrochemical cells by using ,2010-09-26,"Photoelectron spectroscopic measurements have the potential to provide detailed mechanistic insight by resolving chemical states, electrochemically active regions and local potentials or potential losses in operating solid oxide electrochemical cells (SOCs), such as fuel cells. However, high-vacuum requirements have limited X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of electrochemical cells to ex situ investigations. Using a combination of ambient-pressure XPS and CeO2−x/YSZ/Pt single-chamber cells, we carry out in situ spectroscopy to probe oxidation states of all exposed surfaces in operational SOCs at 750 °C in 1 mbar reactant gases H2 and H2O. Kinetic energy shifts of core-level photoelectron spectra provide a direct measure of the local surface potentials and a basis for calculating local overpotentials across exposed interfaces. The mixed ionic/electronic conducting CeO2−x electrodes undergo Ce3+/Ce4+ oxidation–reduction changes with applied bias. The simultaneous measurements of local surface Ce oxidation states and electric potentials reveal the active ceria regions during H2 electro-oxidation and H2O electrolysis. The active regions extend ∼150 μm from the current collectors and are not limited by the three-phase-boundary interfaces associated with other SOC materials. The persistence of the Ce3+/Ce4+ shifts in the ∼150 μm active region suggests that the surface reaction kinetics and lateral electron transport on the thin ceria electrodes are co-limiting processes."
1144,High proton conduction in grain-boundary-free yttrium-doped barium zirconate films grown by pulsed laser deposition,2010-09-19,"Reducing the operating temperature in the 500–750 °C range is needed for widespread use of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Proton-conducting oxides are gaining wide interest as electrolyte materials for this aim. We report the fabrication of BaZr0.8Y0.2O3−δ (BZY) proton-conducting electrolyte thin films by pulsed laser deposition on different single-crystalline substrates. Highly textured, epitaxially oriented BZY films were obtained on (100)-oriented MgO substrates, showing the largest proton conductivity ever reported for BZY samples, being 0.11 S cm−1 at 500 °C. The excellent crystalline quality of BZY films allowed for the first time the experimental measurement of the large BZY bulk conductivity above 300 °C, expected in the absence of blocking grain boundaries. The measured proton conductivity is also significantly larger than the conductivity values of oxygen-ion conductors in the same temperature range, opening new potential for the development of miniaturized SOFCs for portable power supply."
1145,Unusual infrared-absorption mechanism in thermally reduced graphene oxide,2010-09-19,"Infrared absorption of atomic and molecular vibrations in solids can be affected by electronic contributions through non-adiabatic interactions, such as the Fano effect. Typically, the infrared-absorption lineshapes are modified, or infrared-forbidden modes are detectable as a modulation of the electronic absorption. In contrast to such known phenomena, we report here the observation of a giant-infrared-absorption band in reduced graphene oxide, arising from the coupling of electronic states to the asymmetric stretch mode of a yet-unreported structure, consisting of oxygen atoms aggregated at the edges of defects. Free electrons are induced by the displacement of the oxygen atoms, leading to a strong infrared absorption that is in phase with the phonon mode. This new phenomenon is only possible when all other oxygen-containing chemical species, including hydroxyl, carboxyl, epoxide and ketonic functional groups, are removed from the region adjacent to the edges, that is, clean graphene patches are present."
1146,Highly sensitive flexible pressure sensors with microstructured rubber dielectric layers,2010-09-12,"The development of an electronic skin is critical to the realization of artificial intelligence that comes into direct contact with humans, and to biomedical applications such as prosthetic skin. To mimic the tactile sensing properties of natural skin, large arrays of pixel pressure sensors on a flexible and stretchable substrate are required. We demonstrate flexible, capacitive pressure sensors with unprecedented sensitivity and very short response times that can be inexpensively fabricated over large areas by microstructuring of thin films of the biocompatible elastomer polydimethylsiloxane. The pressure sensitivity of the microstructured films far surpassed that exhibited by unstructured elastomeric films of similar thickness, and is tunable by using different microstructures. The microstructured films were integrated into organic field-effect transistors as the dielectric layer, forming a new type of active sensor device with similarly excellent sensitivity and response times."
1147,Exciton antennas and concentrators from core–shell and corrugated carbon nanotube filaments of homogeneous composition,2010-09-12,"There has been renewed interest in solar concentrators and optical antennas for improvements in photovoltaic energy harvesting and new optoelectronic devices. In this work, we dielectrophoretically assemble single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) of homogeneous composition into aligned filaments that can exchange excitation energy, concentrating it to the centre of core–shell structures with radial gradients in the optical bandgap. We find an unusually sharp, reversible decay in photoemission that occurs as such filaments are cycled from ambient temperature to only 357 K, attributed to the strongly temperature-dependent second-order Auger process. Core–shell structures consisting of annular shells of mostly (6,5) SWNTs (Eg=1.21 eV) and cores with bandgaps smaller than those of the shell (Eg=1.17 eV (7,5)–0.98 eV (8,7)) demonstrate the concentration concept: broadband absorption in the ultraviolet–near-infrared wavelength regime provides quasi-singular photoemission at the (8,7) SWNTs. This approach demonstrates the potential of specifically designed collections of nanotubes to manipulate and concentrate excitons in unique ways."
1148,Controlled selectivity for palladium catalysts using self-assembled monolayers,2010-09-12,"The selective reaction of one part of a bifunctional molecule is a fundamental challenge in heterogeneous catalysis and for many processes including the conversion of biomass-derived intermediates. Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated epoxides to saturated epoxides is particularly difficult given the reactivity of the strained epoxide ring, and traditional platinum group catalysts show low selectivities. We describe the preparation of highly selective Pd catalysts involving the deposition of n-alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM) coatings. These coatings improve the selectivity of 1-epoxybutane formation from 1-epoxy-3-butene on palladium catalysts from 11 to 94% at equivalent reaction conditions and conversions. Although sulphur species are generally considered to be indiscriminate catalyst poisons, the reaction rate to the desired product on a catalyst coated with a thiol was 40% of the rate on an uncoated catalyst. Interestingly the activity decreased for less-ordered SAMs with shorter chains. The behaviour of SAM-coated catalysts was compared with catalysts where surface sites were modified by carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons or sulphur atoms. The results suggest that the SAMs restrict sulphur coverage to enhance selectivity without significantly poisoning the activity of the desired reaction."
1149,Combinatorial development of biomaterials for clonal growth of human pluripotent stem cells,2010-08-22,"Both human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells can self-renew indefinitely in culture; however, present methods to clonally grow them are inefficient and poorly defined for genetic manipulation and therapeutic purposes. Here we develop the first chemically defined, xeno-free, feeder-free synthetic substrates to support robust self-renewal of fully dissociated human embryonic stem and induced pluripotent stem cells. Material properties including wettability, surface topography, surface chemistry and indentation elastic modulus of all polymeric substrates were quantified using high-throughput methods to develop structure–function relationships between material properties and biological performance. These analyses show that optimal human embryonic stem cell substrates are generated from monomers with high acrylate content, have a moderate wettability and employ integrin αvβ3 and αvβ5 engagement with adsorbed vitronectin to promote colony formation. The structure–function methodology employed herein provides a general framework for the combinatorial development of synthetic substrates for stem cell culture."
1150,Quantitative prediction of solute strengthening in aluminium alloys,2010-08-01,"Despite significant advances in computational materials science, a quantitative, parameter-free prediction of the mechanical properties of alloys has been difficult to achieve from first principles. Here, we present a new analytic theory that, with input from first-principles calculations, is able to predict the strengthening of aluminium by substitutional solute atoms. Solute–dislocation interaction energies in and around the dislocation core are first calculated using density functional theory and a flexible-boundary-condition method. An analytic model for the strength, or stress to move a dislocation, owing to the random field of solutes, is then presented. The theory, which has no adjustable parameters and is extendable to other metallic alloys, predicts both the energy barriers to dislocation motion and the zero-temperature flow stress, allowing for predictions of finite-temperature flow stresses. Quantitative comparisons with experimental flow stresses at temperature T=78 K are made for Al–X alloys (X=Mg, Si, Cu, Cr) and good agreement is obtained."
1151,Photoactivation of a nanoporous crystal for on-demand guest trapping and conversion,2010-08,"Porous compounds are ubiquitous and indispensable in daily life as adsorbents and catalysts. The discovery of a new porous compound with unique properties based on intrinsic nanosized space and surface functionalities is scientifically and technologically important. However, the functional species used in this context are limited to those that are sufficiently inert to not spoil the porous structures. Here, we show a new strategy to achieve a crystalline porous material with the pore surface regularly decorated with highly reactive ‘bare’ nitrenes that are photonically generated from stable ‘dormant’ precursors at will. The bare triplet nitrenes were accessible to and reacted with adsorbed oxygen or carbon monoxide molecules, which showed not only activation of the pore surface, but also a high probability of chemical trapping and conversion of guest molecules by light stimulation on demand."
1152,DNA translocation through an array of kinked nanopores,2010-08,"Synthetic solid-state nanopores are being intensively investigated as single-molecule sensors for detection and characterization of DNA, RNA and proteins. This field has been inspired by the exquisite selectivity and flux demonstrated by natural biological channels and the dream of emulating these behaviours in more robust synthetic materials that are more readily integrated into practical devices. So far, the guided etching of polymer films, focused ion-beam sculpting, and electron-beam lithography and tuning of silicon nitride membranes have emerged as three promising approaches to define synthetic solid-state pores with sub-nanometre resolution. These procedures have in common the formation of nominally cylindrical or conical pores aligned normal to the membrane surface. Here we report the formation of ‘kinked’ silica nanopores, using evaporation-induced self-assembly, and their further tuning and chemical derivatization using atomic-layer deposition. Compared with ‘straight through’ proteinaceous nanopores of comparable dimensions, kinked nanopores exhibit up to fivefold reduction in translocation velocity, which has been identified as one of the critical issues in DNA sequencing. Additionally, we demonstrate an efficient two-step approach to create a nanopore array exhibiting nearly perfect selectivity for ssDNA over dsDNA. We show that a coarse-grained drift–diffusion theory with a sawtooth-like potential can reasonably describe the velocity and translocation time of DNA through the pore. By control of pore size, length and shape, we capture the main functional behaviours of protein pores in our solid-state nanopore system."
1153,Quantum-dot/dopamine bioconjugates function as redox coupled assemblies for ,2010-08,"The use of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) for bioimaging and sensing has progressively matured over the past decade. QDs are highly sensitive to charge-transfer processes, which can alter their optical properties. Here, we demonstrate that QD–dopamine–peptide bioconjugates can function as charge-transfer coupled pH sensors. Dopamine is normally characterized by two intrinsic redox properties: a Nernstian dependence of formal potential on pH and oxidation of hydroquinone to quinone by O2 at basic pH. We show that the latter quinone can function as an electron acceptor quenching QD photoluminescence in a manner that depends directly on pH. We characterize the pH-dependent QD quenching using both electrochemistry and spectroscopy. QD–dopamine conjugates were also used as pH sensors that measured changes in cytoplasmic pH as cells underwent drug-induced alkalosis. A detailed mechanism describing the QD quenching processes that is consistent with dopamine’s inherent redox chemistry is presented."
1154,Photon-enhanced thermionic emission for solar concentrator systems,2010-08-01,"Solar-energy conversion usually takes one of two forms: the ‘quantum’ approach, which uses the large per-photon energy of solar radiation to excite electrons, as in photovoltaic cells, or the ‘thermal’ approach, which uses concentrated sunlight as a thermal-energy source to indirectly produce electricity using a heat engine. Here we present a new concept for solar electricity generation, photon-enhanced thermionic emission, which combines quantum and thermal mechanisms into a single physical process. The device is based on thermionic emission of photoexcited electrons from a semiconductor cathode at high temperature. Temperature-dependent photoemission-yield measurements from GaN show strong evidence for photon-enhanced thermionic emission, and calculated efficiencies for idealized devices can exceed the theoretical limits of single-junction photovoltaic cells. The proposed solar converter would operate at temperatures exceeding 200 °C, enabling its waste heat to be used to power a secondary thermal engine, boosting theoretical combined conversion efficiencies above 50%."
1155,Reversible electric control of exchange bias in a multiferroic field-effect device,2010-07-25,"Electric-field control of magnetization has many potential applications in magnetic memory storage, sensors and spintronics. One approach to obtain this control is through multiferroic materials. Instead of using direct coupling between ferroelectric and ferromagnetic order parameters in a single-phase multiferroic material, which only shows a weak magnetoelectric effect, a unique method using indirect coupling through an intermediate antiferromagnetic order parameter can be used. In this article, we demonstrate electrical control of exchange bias using a field-effect device employing multiferroic (ferroelectric/antiferromagnetic) BiFeO3 as the dielectric and ferromagnetic La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 as the conducting channel; we can reversibly switch between two distinct exchange-bias states by switching the ferroelectric polarization of BiFeO3. This is an important step towards controlling magnetization with electric fields, which may enable a new class of electrically controllable spintronic devices and provide a new basis for producing electrically controllable spin-polarized currents."
1156,A multiferroic material to search for the permanent electric dipole moment of the electron,2010-07-18,"We describe the first-principles design and subsequent synthesis of a new material with the specific functionalities required for a solid-state-based search for the permanent electric dipole moment of the electron. We show computationally that perovskite-structure europium barium titanate should exhibit the required large and pressure-dependent ferroelectric polarization, local magnetic moments and absence of magnetic ordering at liquid-helium temperature. Subsequent synthesis and characterization of Eu0.5Ba0.5TiO3 ceramics confirm the predicted desirable properties."
1157,Multistability of a coherent spin ensemble in a semiconductor microcavity,2010-07-04,"Coherent manipulation of spin ensembles is a key issue in the development of spintronics. In particular, multivalued spin switching may lead to new schemes of logic gating and memories. This phenomenon has been studied with atom vapours 30 years ago, but is still awaited in the solid state. Here, we demonstrate spin multistability with microcavity polaritons in a trap. Owing to the spinor nature of these light–matter quasiparticles and to the anisotropy of their interactions, we can optically control the spin state of a single confined level by tuning the excitation power, frequency and polarization. First, we realize high-efficiency power-dependent polarization switching. Then, at constant excitation power, we evidence polarization hysteresis and determine the conditions for realizing multivalued spin switching. Finally, we demonstrate an unexpected regime, where our system behaves as a high-contrast spin trigger. These results open new pathways to the development of advanced spintronics devices and to the realization of multivalued logic circuits."
1158,Robust isothermal electric control of exchange bias at room temperature,2010-06-20,"Voltage-controlled spin electronics is crucial for continued progress in information technology. It aims at reduced power consumption, increased integration density and enhanced functionality where non-volatile memory is combined with high-speed logical processing. Promising spintronic device concepts use the electric control of interface and surface magnetization. From the combination of magnetometry, spin-polarized photoemission spectroscopy, symmetry arguments and first-principles calculations, we show that the (0001) surface of magnetoelectric Cr2O3 has a roughness-insensitive, electrically switchable magnetization. Using a ferromagnetic Pd/Co multilayer deposited on the (0001) surface of a Cr2O3 single crystal, we achieve reversible, room-temperature isothermal switching of the exchange-bias field between positive and negative values by reversing the electric field while maintaining a permanent magnetic field. This effect reflects the switching of the bulk antiferromagnetic domain state and the interface magnetization coupled to it. The switchable exchange bias sets in exactly at the bulk Néel temperature."
1159,A self-assembly pathway to aligned monodomain gels,2010-06-13,"Aggregates of charged amphiphilic molecules have been found to access a structure at elevated temperature that templates alignment of supramolecular fibrils over macroscopic scales. The thermal pathway leads to a lamellar plaque structure with fibrous texture that breaks on cooling into large arrays of aligned nanoscale fibres and forms a strongly birefringent liquid. By manually dragging this liquid crystal from a pipette onto salty media, it is possible to extend this alignment over centimetres in noodle-shaped viscoelastic strings. Using this approach, the solution of supramolecular filaments can be mixed with cells at physiological temperatures to form monodomain gels of aligned cells and filaments. The nature of the self-assembly process and its biocompatibility would allow formation of cellular wires in situ that have any length and customized peptide compositions for use in biological applications."
1160,Extremely long quasiparticle spin lifetimes in superconducting aluminium using MgO tunnel spin injectors,2010-06-06,"There has been an intense search in recent years for long-lived spin-polarized carriers for spintronic and quantum-computing devices. Here we report that spin-polarized quasiparticles in superconducting aluminium layers have surprisingly long spin lifetimes, nearly a million times longer than in their normal state. The lifetime is determined from the suppression of the aluminium’s superconductivity resulting from the accumulation of spin-polarized carriers in the aluminium layer using tunnel spin injectors. A Hanle effect, observed in the presence of small in-plane orthogonal fields, is shown to be quantitatively consistent with the presence of long-lived spin-polarized quasiparticles. Our experiments show that the superconducting state can be significantly modified by small electric currents, much smaller than the critical current, which is potentially useful for devices involving superconducting qubits."
1161, NMR observation of the formation of metallic lithium microstructures in lithium batteries,2010-05-16,"Lithium metal has the highest volumetric and gravimetric energy density of all negative-electrode materials when used as an electrode material in a lithium rechargeable battery. However, the formation of lithium dendrites and/or ‘moss’ on the metal electrode surface can lead to short circuits following several electrochemical charge–discharge cycles, particularly at high rates, rendering this class of batteries potentially unsafe and unusable owing to the risk of fire and explosion. Many recent investigations have focused on the development of methods to prevent moss/dendrite formation. In parallel, it is important to quantify Li-moss formation, to identify the conditions under which it forms. Although optical and electron microscopy can visually monitor the morphology of the lithium-electrode surface and hence the moss formation, such methods are not well suited for quantitative studies. Here we report the use of in situ NMR spectroscopy, to provide time-resolved, quantitative information about the nature of the metallic lithium deposited on lithium-metal electrodes."
1162,Precise control of thermal conductivity at the nanoscale through individual phonon-scattering barriers,2010-05-02,"The ability to precisely control the thermal conductivity (κ) of a material is fundamental in the development of on-chip heat management or energy conversion applications. Nanostructuring permits a marked reduction of κ of single-crystalline materials, as recently demonstrated for silicon nanowires. However, silicon-based nanostructured materials with extremely low κ are not limited to nanowires. By engineering a set of individual phonon-scattering nanodot barriers we have accurately tailored the thermal conductivity of a single-crystalline SiGe material in spatially defined regions as short as ∼15 nm. Single-barrier thermal resistances between 2 and 4×10−9 m2 K W−1 were attained, resulting in a room-temperature κ down to about 0.9 W m−1 K−1, in multilayered structures with as little as five barriers. Such low thermal conductivity is compatible with a totally diffuse mismatch model for the barriers, and it is well below the amorphous limit. The results are in agreement with atomistic Green’s function simulations."
1163,Organic light-emitting transistors with an efficiency that outperforms the equivalent light-emitting diodes,2010-05-02,"The potential of organic semiconductor-based devices for light generation is demonstrated by the commercialization of display technologies based on organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Nonetheless, exciton quenching and photon loss processes still limit OLED efficiency and brightness. Organic light-emitting transistors (OLETs) are alternative light sources combining, in the same architecture, the switching mechanism of a thin-film transistor and an electroluminescent device. Thus, OLETs could open a new era in organic optoelectronics and serve as testbeds to address general fundamental optoelectronic and photonic issues. Here, we introduce the concept of using a p-channel/emitter/n-channel trilayer semiconducting heterostructure in OLETs, providing a new approach to markedly improve OLET performance and address these open questions. In this architecture, exciton–charge annihilation and electrode photon losses are prevented. Our devices are >100 times more efficient than the equivalent OLED, >2× more efficient than the optimized OLED with the same emitting layer and >10 times more efficient than any other reported OLETs."
1164,Harnessing traction-mediated manipulation of the cell/matrix interface to control stem-cell fate,2010-04-25,"Stem cells sense and respond to the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix. However, both the extent to which extracellular-matrix mechanics affect stem-cell fate in three-dimensional microenvironments and the underlying biophysical mechanisms are unclear. We demonstrate that the commitment of mesenchymal stem-cell populations changes in response to the rigidity of three-dimensional microenvironments, with osteogenesis occurring predominantly at 11–30 kPa. In contrast to previous two-dimensional work, however, cell fate was not correlated with morphology. Instead, matrix stiffness regulated integrin binding as well as reorganization of adhesion ligands on the nanoscale, both of which were traction dependent and correlated with osteogenic commitment of mesenchymal stem-cell populations. These findings suggest that cells interpret changes in the physical properties of adhesion substrates as changes in adhesion-ligand presentation, and that cells themselves can be harnessed as tools to mechanically process materials into structures that feed back to manipulate their fate."
1165,State-selective dissociation of a single water molecule on an ultrathin MgO film,2010-04-18,"The interaction of water with oxide surfaces has drawn considerable interest, owing to its application to problems in diverse scientific fields. Atomic-scale insights into water molecules on the oxide surface have long been recognized as essential for a fundamental understanding of the molecular processes occurring there. Here, we report the dissociation of a single water molecule on an ultrathin MgO film using low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy. Two types of dissociation pathway—vibrational excitation and electronic excitation—are selectively achieved by means of injecting tunnelling electrons at the single-molecule level, resulting in different dissociated products according to the reaction paths. Our results reveal the advantage of using a MgO film, rather than bulk MgO, as a substrate in chemical reactions."
1166,Dissolvable films of silk fibroin for ultrathin conformal bio-integrated electronics,2010-04-18,"Electronics that are capable of intimate, non-invasive integration with the soft, curvilinear surfaces of biological tissues offer important opportunities for diagnosing and treating disease and for improving brain/machine interfaces. This article describes a material strategy for a type of bio-interfaced system that relies on ultrathin electronics supported by bioresorbable substrates of silk fibroin. Mounting such devices on tissue and then allowing the silk to dissolve and resorb initiates a spontaneous, conformal wrapping process driven by capillary forces at the biotic/abiotic interface. Specialized mesh designs and ultrathin forms for the electronics ensure minimal stresses on the tissue and highly conformal coverage, even for complex curvilinear surfaces, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical studies. In vivo, neural mapping experiments on feline animal models illustrate one mode of use for this class of technology. These concepts provide new capabilities for implantable and surgical devices."
1167,The thermodynamic origin of hysteresis in insertion batteries,2010-04-11,"Lithium batteries are considered the key storage devices for most emerging green technologies such as wind and solar technologies or hybrid and plug-in electric vehicles. Despite the tremendous recent advances in battery research, surprisingly, several fundamental issues of increasing practical importance have not been adequately tackled. One such issue concerns the energy efficiency. Generally, charging of 1010–1017 electrode particles constituting a modern battery electrode proceeds at (much) higher voltages than discharging. Most importantly, the hysteresis between the charge and discharge voltage seems not to disappear as the charging/discharging current vanishes. Herein we present, for the first time, a general explanation of the occurrence of inherent hysteretic behaviour in insertion storage systems containing multiple particles. In a broader sense, the model also predicts the existence of apparent equilibria in battery electrodes, the sequential particle-by-particle charging/discharging mechanism and the disappearance of two-phase behaviour at special experimental conditions."
1168,Free-floating ultrathin two-dimensional crystals from sequence-specific peptoid polymers,2010-04-11,"The design and synthesis of protein-like polymers is a fundamental challenge in materials science. A biomimetic approach is to explore the impact of monomer sequence on non-natural polymer structure and function. We present the aqueous self-assembly of two peptoid polymers into extremely thin two-dimensional (2D) crystalline sheets directed by periodic amphiphilicity, electrostatic recognition and aromatic interactions. Peptoids are sequence-specific, oligo-N-substituted glycine polymers designed to mimic the structure and functionality of proteins. Mixing a 1:1 ratio of two oppositely charged peptoid 36mers of a specific sequence in aqueous solution results in the formation of giant, free-floating sheets with only 2.7 nm thickness. Direct visualization of aligned individual peptoid chains in the sheet structure was achieved using aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy. Specific binding of a protein to ligand-functionalized sheets was also demonstrated. The synthetic flexibility and biocompatibility of peptoids provide a flexible and robust platform for integrating functionality into defined 2D nanostructures."
1169,Irreversible nanogel formation in surfactant solutions by microporous flow,2010-03-21,"Self-assembly of surfactant molecules into micelles of various shapes and forms has been extensively used to synthesize soft nanomaterials. Translucent solutions containing rod-like surfactant micelles can self-organize under flow to form viscoelastic gels. This flow-induced structure (FIS) formation has excited much fundamental research and pragmatic interest as a cost-effective manufacturing route for active nanomaterials. However, its practical impact has been very limited because all reported FIS transitions are reversible because the gel disintegrates soon after flow stoppage. We present a new microfluidics-assisted robust laminar-flow process, which allows for the generation of extension rates many orders of magnitude greater than is realizable in conventional devices, to produce purely flow-induced permanent nanogels. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy imaging of the gel reveals a partially aligned micelle network. The critical flow rate for gel formation is consistent with the Turner–Cates fusion mechanism, proposed originally to explain reversible FIS formation in rod-like micelle solutions."
1170,High-performance lithium-ion anodes using a hierarchical bottom-up approach,2010-03-14,"Si-based Li-ion battery anodes have recently received great attention, as they offer specific capacity an order of magnitude beyond that of conventional graphite. The applications of this transformative technology require synthesis routes capable of producing safe and easy-to-handle anode particles with low volume changes and stable performance during battery operation. Herein, we report a large-scale hierarchical bottom-up assembly route for the formation of Si on the nanoscale—containing rigid and robust spheres with irregular channels for rapid access of Li ions into the particle bulk. Large Si volume changes on Li insertion and extraction are accommodated by the particle’s internal porosity. Reversible capacities over five times higher than that of the state-of-the-art anodes (1,950 mA h g−1) and stable performance are attained. The synthesis process is simple, low-cost, safe and broadly applicable, providing new avenues for the rational engineering of electrode materials with enhanced conductivity and power."
1171,"Nanoconfinement controls stiffness, strength and mechanical toughness of β-sheet crystals in silk",2010-03-14,"Silk features exceptional mechanical properties such as high tensile strength and great extensibility, making it one of the toughest materials known. The exceptional strength of silkworm and spider silks, exceeding that of steel, arises from β-sheet nanocrystals that universally consist of highly conserved poly-(Gly-Ala) and poly-Ala domains. This is counterintuitive because the key molecular interactions in β-sheet nanocrystals are hydrogen bonds, one of the weakest chemical bonds known. Here we report a series of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, revealing that β-sheet nanocrystals confined to a few nanometres achieve higher stiffness, strength and mechanical toughness than larger nanocrystals. We illustrate that through nanoconfinement, a combination of uniform shear deformation that makes most efficient use of hydrogen bonds and the emergence of dissipative molecular stick–slip deformation leads to significantly enhanced mechanical properties. Our findings explain how size effects can be exploited to create bioinspired materials with superior mechanical properties in spite of relying on mechanically inferior, weak hydrogen bonds."
1172,Chemically driven carbon-nanotube-guided thermopower waves,2010-03-07,"Theoretical calculations predict that by coupling an exothermic chemical reaction with a nanotube or nanowire possessing a high axial thermal conductivity, a self-propagating reactive wave can be driven along its length. Herein, such waves are realized using a 7-nm cyclotrimethylene trinitramine annular shell around a multiwalled carbon nanotube and are amplified by more than 104 times the bulk value, propagating faster than 2 m s−1, with an effective thermal conductivity of 1.28±0.2 kW m−1 K−1 at 2,860 K. This wave produces a concomitant electrical pulse of disproportionately high specific power, as large as 7 kW kg−1, which we identify as a thermopower wave. Thermally excited carriers flow in the direction of the propagating reaction with a specific power that scales inversely with system size. The reaction also evolves an anisotropic pressure wave of high total impulse per mass (300 N s kg−1). Such waves of high power density may find uses as unique energy sources."
1173,Electric-field-controlled ferromagnetism in high-Curie-temperature Mn,2010-03-07,"Electric-field manipulation of ferromagnetism has the potential for developing a new generation of electric devices to resolve the power consumption and variability issues in today’s microelectronics industry. Among various dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs), group IV elements such as Si and Ge are the ideal material candidates because of their excellent compatibility with the conventional complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) technology. Here we report, for the first time, the successful synthesis of self-assembled dilute magnetic Mn0.05Ge0.95 quantum dots with ferromagnetic order above room temperature, and the demonstration of electric-field control of ferromagnetism in MOS ferromagnetic capacitors up to 100 K. We found that by applying electric fields to a MOS gate structure, the ferromagnetism of the channel layer can be effectively modulated through the change of hole concentration inside the quantum dots. Our results are fundamentally important in the understanding and to the realization of high-efficiency Ge-based spin field-effect transistors."
1174,Atomic layers of hybridized boron nitride and graphene domains,2010-02-28,"Two-dimensional materials, such as graphene and monolayer hexagonal BN (h-BN), are attractive for demonstrating fundamental physics in materials and potential applications in next-generation electronics. Atomic sheets containing hybridized bonds involving elements B, N and C over wide compositional ranges could result in new materials with properties complementary to those of graphene and h-BN, enabling a rich variety of electronic structures, properties and applications. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of large-area atomic layers of h-BNC material, consisting of hybridized, randomly distributed domains of h-BN and C phases with compositions ranging from pure BN to pure graphene. Our studies reveal that their structural features and bandgap are distinct from those of graphene, doped graphene and h-BN. This new form of hybrid h-BNC material enables the development of bandgap-engineered applications in electronics and optics and properties that are distinct from those of graphene and h-BN."
1175,Plastic-deformation mechanism in complex solids,2010-02-28,"In simple crystalline materials, plastic deformation mostly takes place by the movement of dislocations. Although the underlying mechanisms in these materials are well explored, in complex metallic alloys—crystalline solids containing up to thousands of atoms per unit cell—the defects and deformation mechanisms remain essentially unknown. Owing to the large lattice parameters of these materials, extended dislocation concepts are required. We investigated a typical complex metallic alloy with 156 atoms per unit cell using atomic-resolution aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy. We found a highly complex deformation mechanism, based on the movement of a dislocation core mediating strain and separate escort defects. On deformation, the escort defects move along with the dislocation core and locally transform the material structure for the latter. This mechanism implies the coordinated movement of hundreds of atoms per elementary glide step, and nevertheless can be described by simple rearrangement of basic structural subunits."
1176,A genetic algorithm for predicting the structures of interfaces in multicomponent systems,2010-02-28,"Recent years have seen great advances in our ability to predict crystal structures from first principles. However, previous algorithms have focused on the prediction of bulk crystal structures, where the global minimum is the target. Here, we present a general atomistic approach to simulate in multicomponent systems the structures and free energies of grain boundaries and heterophase interfaces with fixed stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric compositions. The approach combines a new genetic algorithm using empirical interatomic potentials to explore the configurational phase space of boundaries, and thereafter refining structures and free energies with first-principles electronic structure methods. We introduce a structural order parameter to bias the genetic algorithm search away from the global minimum (which would be bulk crystal), while not favouring any particular structure types, unless they lower the energy. We demonstrate the power and efficiency of the algorithm by considering non-stoichiometric grain boundaries in a ternary oxide, SrTiO3."
1177,Critical-like behaviour of glass-forming liquids,2010-02-21,"Recently it has been revealed that when approaching the glass-transition temperature, Tg, the dynamics of a liquid not only drastically slows down, but also becomes progressively more heterogeneous. From our simulations and experiments of six different glass-forming liquids, we find that the heterogeneous dynamics is a result of critical-like fluctuations of static structural order, contrary to a common belief that it is purely of dynamic origin. The static correlation length and susceptibility of a structural order parameter show Ising-like power-law divergence towards the ideal glass-transition point. However, this structural ordering accompanies little density change, which explains why it has not been detected by the static structure factor so far. Our results suggest a far more direct link than thought before between glass transition and critical phenomena. Indeed, the glass transition may be a new type of critical phenomenon where a structural order parameter is directly linked to slowness."
1178,Insulating interlocked ferroelectric and structural antiphase domain walls in multiferroic YMnO,2010-02-14,"Hexagonal YMnO3 shows a unique improper ferroelectricity induced by structural trimerization. Extensive research on this system is primarily due to its candidacy for ferroelectric memory as well as the intriguing coexistence of ferroelectricity and magnetism. Despite this research, the true ferroelectric domain structure and its relationship with structural domains have never been revealed. Using transmission electron microscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy, we observed an intriguing conductive ‘cloverleaf’ pattern of six domains emerging from one point—all distinctly characterized by polarization orientation and structural antiphase relationships. In addition, we discovered that the ferroelectric domain walls and structural antiphase boundaries are mutually locked and this strong locking results in incomplete poling even when large electric fields are applied. Furthermore, the locked walls are found to be insulating, which seems consistent with the surprising result that the ferroelectric state is more conducting than the paraelectric state. These fascinating results reveal the rich physics of the hexagonal system with a truly semiconducting bandgap where structural trimerization, ferroelectricity, magnetism and charge conduction are intricately coupled."
1179,Isotope effect in spin response of ,2010-02-14,"Recent advances in organic spin response include long polaron spin-coherence times measured by optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), substantive room-temperature magnetoelectroluminescence and magnetoconductance obtained in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and spin-polarized carrier injection from ferromagnetic electrodes in organic spin valves (OSVs). Although the hyperfine interaction (HFI) has been foreseen to have an important role in organic spin response, no clear experimental evidence has been reported so far. Using the chemical versatility advantage of the organics, we studied and compared spin responses in films, OLED and OSV devices based on π-conjugated polymers made of protonated, H-, and deuterated, D-hydrogen having a weaker HFI strength. We demonstrate that the HFI does indeed have a crucial role in all three spin responses. OLED films based on the D-polymers show substantially narrower magneto-electroluminescence and ODMR responses, and as a result of the longer spin diffusion obtained, OSV devices based on D-polymers show a substantially larger magnetoresistance."
1180,Multimeric small interfering ribonucleic acid for highly efficient sequence-specific gene silencing,2010-01-24,"Small interfering RNA (siRNA) with 19–21 base pairs has been recently recognized as a new therapeutic agent for effectively silencing a specific gene on a post-transcription level. For siRNA therapeutics, safe and efficient delivery issues are significant hurdles to clinical applications. Here we present a new class of biologically active siRNA structure based on chemically self-crosslinked and multimerized siRNA through cleavable disulphide linkages. The multimerized siRNA can produce more stable and compact polyelectrolyte complexes with less cytotoxic cationic carriers than naked siRNA because of substantially increased charge densities and the presence of flexible chemical linkers in the backbone. The cleavable and multimerized siRNA shows greatly enhanced gene-silencing efficiencies in vitro and in vivo through a target-messenger-RNA-specific RNA interference processing without significantly eliciting immune induction. This study demonstrates that the multimerized siRNA structure complexed with selected cationic condensing agents can serve as potential gene-silencing therapeutics for treating various diseases."
1181,Nanopatterning Si(111) surfaces as a selective surface-chemistry route,2010-01-10,"Using wet-chemical self-assembly, we demonstrate that standard surface reactions can be markedly altered. Although HF etching of Si surfaces is known to produce H-terminated surfaces, we show that up to ∼30% of a monolayer of stable Si–F bonds can be formed on atomically smooth Si(111) surfaces on HF reaction, when chemically isolated Si atoms are the target of the reaction. Similarly, ∼30% Si–OH termination can be achieved by immersion of the partially covered F–Si(111) surface in water without oxidation of the underlying Si substrate. Such reactions are possible when H-terminated (111)-oriented Si surfaces are initially uniformly patterned with methoxy groups. These findings are contrary to the knowledge built over the past twenty years and highlight the importance of steric interactions at surfaces and the possibility to stabilize products at surfaces that cannot be obtained on chemically homogeneous surfaces."
1182,Ordered mesoporous ,2010-01-10,"Capacitive energy storage is distinguished from other types of electrochemical energy storage by short charging times and the ability to deliver significantly more power than batteries. A key limitation to this technology is its low energy density and for this reason there is considerable interest in exploring pseudocapacitive materials where faradaic mechanisms offer increased levels of energy storage. Here we show that the capacitive charge-storage properties of mesoporous films of iso-oriented α-MoO3 are superior to those of either mesoporous amorphous material or non-porous crystalline MoO3. Whereas both crystalline and amorphous mesoporous materials show redox pseudocapacitance, the iso-oriented layered crystalline domains enable lithium ions to be inserted into the van der Waals gaps of the α-MoO3. We propose that this extra contribution arises from an intercalation pseudocapacitance, which occurs on the same timescale as redox pseudocapacitance. The result is increased charge-storage capacity without compromising charge/discharge kinetics in mesoporous crystalline MoO3."
1183,Dynamic display of biomolecular patterns through an elastic creasing instability of stimuli-responsive hydrogels,2009-12-20,"Surfaces with physicochemical properties that can be modulated using external stimuli offer great promise for designing responsive or adaptive materials. Here, we describe biocompatible dynamic scaffolds based on thin hydrogel coatings that reversibly hide and display surface chemical patterns in response to temperature changes. At room temperature, the gel absorbs water, triggering an elastic creasing instability that sequesters functionalized regions within tight folds in the surface. Deswelling at ∼37 ∘C causes the gel surface to unfold, thereby regenerating the biomolecular patterns. Crease positions are directed by topographic features on the underlying substrate, and are translated into two-dimensional micrometre-scale surface chemical patterns through selective deposition of biochemically functionalized polyelectrolytes. We demonstrate specific applications of these dynamic scaffolds—selective capture, sequestration and release of micrometre-sized beads, tunable activity of surface-immobilized enzymes and reversible encapsulation of adherent cells—which offer promise for incorporation within lab-on-a-chip devices or as dynamic substrates for cellular biology."
1184,Oscillatory spin-polarized tunnelling from silicon quantum wells controlled by electric field,2009-12-13,"Spin-dependent electronic transport is widely used to probe and manipulate magnetic materials and develop spin-based devices. Spin-polarized tunnelling, successful in ferromagnetic metal junctions, was recently used to inject and detect electron spins in organics and bulk GaAs or Si. Electric field control of spin precession was studied in III–V semiconductors relying on spin–orbit interaction, which makes this approach inefficient for Si, the mainstream semiconductor. Methods to control spin other than through precession are thus desired. Here we demonstrate electrostatic modification of the magnitude of spin polarization in a silicon quantum well, and detection thereof by means of tunnelling to a ferromagnet, producing prominent oscillations of tunnel magnetoresistance of up to 8%. The electric modification of the spin polarization relies on discrete states in the Si with a Zeeman spin splitting, an approach that is also applicable to organic, carbon-based and other materials with weak spin–orbit interaction."
1185,Nanogap-engineerable Raman-active nanodumbbells for single-molecule detection,2009-12-13,"Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based signal amplification and detection methods using plasmonic nanostructures have been widely investigated for imaging and sensing applications. However, SERS-based molecule detection strategies have not been practically useful because there is no straightforward method to synthesize and characterize highly sensitive SERS-active nanostructures with sufficiently high yield and efficiency, which results in an extremely low cross-section area in Raman sensing. Here, we report a high-yield synthetic method for SERS-active gold–silver core–shell nanodumbbells, where the gap between two nanoparticles and the Raman-dye position and environment can be engineered on the nanoscale. Atomic-force-microscope-correlated nano-Raman measurements of individual dumbbell structures demonstrate that Raman signals can be repeatedly detected from single-DNA-tethered nanodumbbells. These programmed nanostructure fabrication and single-DNA detection strategies open avenues for the high-yield synthesis of optically active smart nanoparticles and structurally reproducible nanostructure-based single-molecule detection and bioassays."
1186,Explaining the paradoxical diversity of ultrafast laser-induced demagnetization,2009-12-13,"Pulsed-laser-induced quenching of ferromagnetic order has intrigued researchers since pioneering works in the 1990s. It was reported that demagnetization in gadolinium proceeds within 100 ps, but three orders of magnitude faster in ferromagnetic transition metals such as nickel. Here we show that a model based on electron–phonon-mediated spin-flip scattering explains both timescales on equal footing. Our interpretation is supported by ab initio estimates of the spin-flip scattering probability, and experimental fluence dependencies are shown to agree perfectly with predictions. A phase diagram is constructed in which two classes of laser-induced magnetization dynamics can be distinguished, where the ratio of the Curie temperature to the atomic magnetic moment turns out to have a crucial role. We conclude that the ultrafast magnetization dynamics can be well described disregarding highly excited electronic states, merely considering the thermalized electron system."
1187,Porous metal–organic-framework nanoscale carriers as a potential platform for drug delivery and imaging,2009-12-13,"In the domain of health, one important challenge is the efficient delivery of drugs in the body using non-toxic nanocarriers. Most of the existing carrier materials show poor drug loading (usually less than 5 wt% of the transported drug versus the carrier material) and/or rapid release of the proportion of the drug that is simply adsorbed (or anchored) at the external surface of the nanocarrier. In this context, porous hybrid solids, with the ability to tune their structures and porosities for better drug interactions and high loadings, are well suited to serve as nanocarriers for delivery and imaging applications. Here we show that specific non-toxic porous iron(III)-based metal–organic frameworks with engineered cores and surfaces, as well as imaging properties, function as superior nanocarriers for efficient controlled delivery of challenging antitumoural and retroviral drugs (that is, busulfan, azidothymidine triphosphate, doxorubicin or cidofovir) against cancer and AIDS. In addition to their high loadings, they also potentially associate therapeutics and diagnostics, thus opening the way for theranostics, or personalized patient treatments."
1188,Three-dimensional structure and multistable optical switching of triple-twisted particle-like excitations in anisotropic fluids,2009-12-06,"Control of structures in soft materials with long-range order forms the basis for applications such as displays, liquid-crystal biosensors, tunable lenses, distributed feedback lasers, muscle-like actuators and beam-steering devices. Bistable, tristable and multistable switching of well-defined structures of molecular alignment is of special interest for all of these applications. Here we describe the facile optical creation and multistable switching of localized configurations in the molecular orientation field of a chiral nematic anisotropic fluid. These localized chiro-elastic particle-like excitations—dubbed ‘triple-twist torons’—are generated by vortex laser beams and embed the localized three-dimensional (3D) twist into a uniform background. Confocal polarizing microscopy and computer simulations reveal their equilibrium internal structures, manifesting both skyrmion-like and Hopf fibration features. Robust generation of torons at predetermined locations combined with both optical and electrical reversible switching can lead to new ways of multistable structuring of complex photonic architectures in soft materials."
1189,High-performance polymer semiconducting heterostructure devices by nitrene-mediated photocrosslinking of alkyl side chains,2009-12-06,"Heterostructures are central to the efficient manipulation of charge carriers, excitons and photons for high-performance semiconductor devices. Although these can be formed by stepwise evaporation of molecular semiconductors, they are a considerable challenge for polymers owing to re-dissolution of the underlying layers. Here we demonstrate a simple and versatile photocrosslinking methodology based on sterically hindered bis(fluorophenyl azide)s. The photocrosslinking efficiency is high and dominated by alkyl side-chain insertion reactions, which do not degrade semiconductor properties. We demonstrate two new back-infiltrated and contiguous interpenetrating donor–acceptor heterostructures for photovoltaic applications that inherently overcome internal recombination losses by ensuring path continuity to give high carrier-collection efficiency. This provides the appropriate morphology for high-efficiency polymer-based photovoltaics. We also demonstrate photopatternable polymer-based field-effect transistors and light-emitting diodes, and highly efficient separate-confinement-heterostructure light-emitting diodes. These results open the way to the general development of high-performance polymer semiconductor heterostructures that have not previously been thought possible."
1190,Exceptional high-temperature stability through distillation-like self-stabilization in bimetallic nanoparticles,2009-11-29,"Metal nanoparticles with precisely controlled size and composition are highly attractive for heterogeneous catalysis. However, their poor thermal stability remains a major hurdle on the way towards application at realistic technical conditions. Recent progress in this area has focused on nanostructured oxides to stabilize embedded metal nanoparticles. Here, we report an alternative approach that relies on synthesizing bimetallic nanoparticles with precise compositional control to obtain improved high-temperature stability. We find that PtRh nanoparticles with sufficiently high Rh content survive extended calcination at temperatures up to ∼850 ∘C without significant sintering. For lower Rh content, sacrificial self-stabilization of individual nanoparticles through a distillation-like process is observed: the low-melting-point metal (Pt) bleeds out and the increasing concentration of the high-melting-point metal (Rh) leads to re-stabilization of the remaining nanoparticle. This principle of thermal self-stabilization should be broadly applicable to the development of multi-metallic nanomaterials for a broad range of high-temperature applications."
1191,A 3.6 V lithium-based fluorosulphate insertion positive electrode for lithium-ion batteries,2009-11-29,"Li-ion batteries have contributed to the commercial success of portable electronics, and are now in a position to influence higher-volume applications such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Most commercial Li-ion batteries use positive electrodes based on lithium cobalt oxides. Despite showing a lower voltage than cobalt-based systems (3.45 V versus 4 V) and a lower energy density, LiFePO4 has emerged as a promising contender owing to the cost sensitivity of higher-volume markets. LiFePO4 also shows intrinsically low ionic and electronic transport, necessitating nanosizing and/or carbon coating. Clearly, there is a need for inexpensive materials with higher energy densities. Although this could in principle be achieved by introducing fluorine and by replacing phosphate groups with more electron-withdrawing sulphate groups, this avenue has remained unexplored. Herein, we synthesize and show promising electrode performance for LiFeSO4F. This material shows a slightly higher voltage (3.6 V versus Li) than LiFePO4 and suppresses the need for nanosizing or carbon coating while sharing the same cost advantage. This work not only provides a positive-electrode contender to rival LiFePO4, but also suggests that broad classes of fluoro-oxyanion materials could be discovered."
1192,Biofunctionalized magnetic-vortex microdiscs for targeted cancer-cell destruction,2009-11-29,"Nanomagnetic materials offer exciting avenues for probing cell mechanics and activating mechanosensitive ion channels, as well as for advancing cancer therapies. Most experimental works so far have used superparamagnetic materials. This report describes a first approach based on interfacing cells with lithographically defined microdiscs that possess a spin-vortex ground state. When an alternating magnetic field is applied the microdisc vortices shift, creating an oscillation, which transmits a mechanical force to the cell. Because reduced sensitivity of cancer cells toward apoptosis leads to inappropriate cell survival and malignant progression, selective induction of apoptosis is of great importance for the anticancer therapeutic strategies. We show that the spin-vortex-mediated stimulus creates two dramatic effects: compromised integrity of the cellular membrane, and initiation of programmed cell death. A low-frequency field of a few tens of hertz applied for only ten minutes was sufficient to achieve ∼90% cancer-cell destruction in vitro."
1193,Size and shape effects on the order–disorder phase transition in CoPt nanoparticles,2009-11-15,"Chemically ordered bimetallic nanoparticles are promising candidates for magnetic-storage applications. However, the use of sub-10 nm nanomagnets requires further study of possible size effects on their physical properties. Here, the effects of size and morphology on the order–disorder phase transition temperature of CoPt nanoparticles (TCNP) have been investigated experimentally, using transmission electron microscopy, and theoretically, with canonical Monte Carlo simulations. For 2.4–3-nm particles, TCNP is found to be 325–175 ∘C lower than the bulk material transition temperature, consistent with our Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, we establish that TCNP is also sensitive to the shape of the nanoparticles, because only one dimension of the particle (that is, in-plane size or thickness) smaller than 3 nm is sufficient to induce a considerable depression of TCNP. This work emphasizes the necessity of taking into account the three-dimensional morphology of nano-objects to understand and control their structural properties."
1194,Giant Zeeman splitting in nucleation-controlled doped CdSe:Mn,2009-11-15,"Doping of semiconductor nanocrystals by transition-metal ions has attracted tremendous attention owing to their nanoscale spintronic applications. Such doping is, however, difficult to achieve in low-dimensional strongly quantum confined nanostructures by conventional growth procedures. Here we demonstrate that the incorporation of manganese ions up to 10% into CdSe quantum nanoribbons can be readily achieved by a nucleation-controlled doping process. The cation-exchange reaction of (CdSe)13 clusters with Mn2+ ions governs the Mn2+ incorporation during the nucleation stage. This highly efficient Mn2+ doping of the CdSe quantum nanoribbons results in giant exciton Zeeman splitting with an effective g-factor of ∼600, the largest value seen so far in diluted magnetic semiconductor nanocrystals. Furthermore, the sign of the s–d exchange is inverted to negative owing to the exceptionally strong quantum confinement in our nanoribbons. The nucleation-controlled doping strategy demonstrated here thus opens the possibility of doping various strongly quantum confined nanocrystals for diverse applications."
1195,Metastable and unstable cellular solidification of colloidal suspensions,2009-11-08,"Colloidal particles are often seen as big atoms that can be directly observed in real space. They are therefore becoming increasingly important as model systems to study processes of interest in condensed-matter physics such as melting, freezing and glass transitions. The solidification of colloidal suspensions has long been a puzzling phenomenon with many unexplained features. Here, we demonstrate and rationalize the existence of instability and metastability domains in cellular solidification of colloidal suspensions, by direct in situ high-resolution X-ray radiography and tomography observations. We explain such interface instabilities by a partial Brownian diffusion of the particles leading to constitutional supercooling situations. Processing under unstable conditions leads to localized and global kinetic instabilities of the solid/liquid interface, affecting the crystal morphology and particle redistribution behaviour."
1196,Self-assembling chimeric polypeptide–doxorubicin conjugate nanoparticles that abolish tumours after a single injection,2009-11-08,"New strategies to self-assemble biocompatible materials into nanoscale, drug-loaded packages with improved therapeutic efficacy are needed for nanomedicine. To address this need, we developed artificial recombinant chimeric polypeptides (CPs) that spontaneously self-assemble into sub-100-nm-sized, near-monodisperse nanoparticles on conjugation of diverse hydrophobic molecules, including chemotherapeutics. These CPs consist of a biodegradable polypeptide that is attached to a short Cys-rich segment. Covalent modification of the Cys residues with a structurally diverse set of hydrophobic small molecules, including chemotherapeutics, leads to spontaneous formation of nanoparticles over a range of CP compositions and molecular weights. When used to deliver chemotherapeutics to a murine cancer model, CP nanoparticles have a fourfold higher maximum tolerated dose than free drug, and induce nearly complete tumour regression after a single dose. This simple strategy can promote co-assembly of drugs, imaging agents and targeting moieties into multifunctional nanomedicines."
1197,Large modulation of carrier transport by grain-boundary molecular packing and microstructure in organic thin films,2009-11-08,"Solution-processable organic semiconductors are central to developing viable printed electronics, and performance comparable to that of amorphous silicon has been reported for films grown from soluble semiconductors. However, the seemingly desirable formation of large crystalline domains introduces grain boundaries, resulting in substantial device-to-device performance variations. Indeed, for films where the grain-boundary structure is random, a few unfavourable grain boundaries may dominate device performance. Here we isolate the effects of molecular-level structure at grain boundaries by engineering the microstructure of the high-performance n-type perylenediimide semiconductor PDI8–CN2 and analyse their consequences for charge transport. A combination of advanced X-ray scattering, first-principles computation and transistor characterization applied to PDI8–CN2 films reveals that grain-boundary orientation modulates carrier mobility by approximately two orders of magnitude. For PDI8–CN2 we show that the molecular packing motif (that is, herringbone versus slip-stacked) plays a decisive part in grain-boundary-induced transport anisotropy. The results of this study provide important guidelines for designing device-optimized molecular semiconductors."
1198,Nanostructured arrays of semiconducting octahedral molecular sieves by pulsed-laser deposition,2009-11-01,"Cryptomelane-type manganese oxide (OMS-2) has been widely used to explore the semiconducting and catalytic properties of molecular sieves with mixed-valent frameworks. Selective synthesis of patterned thin films of OMS-2 with hierarchical nanostructures and oriented crystals is challenging owing to difficulties in preserving the mixed valence, porosity and crystalline phase. Here, we report that pulsed-laser ablation of OMS-2 in an oxygen-rich medium produces a three-dimensional nanostructured array of parallel and inclined OMS-2 fibres on bare substrates of (001) single-crystal strontium titanate. Both parallel and inclined OMS-2 fibres elongate along the [001]OMS-2 direction. The parallel fibres interact strongly with the substrate and grow epitaxially along 〈110〉STO with lattice misfits of less than 4%, whereas the inclined fibres are oriented with (301) parallel to the substrate surface. The spontaneous orientation of the crystalline OMS-2 domains over the STO surface opens up a new avenue in lattice-engineered synthesis of multilayer materials."
1199,Reduction of the bulk modulus at high pressure in CrN,2009-10-25,"Nitride coatings are increasingly demanded in the cutting- and machining-tool industry owing to their hardness, thermal stability and resistance to corrosion. These properties derive from strongly covalent bonds; understanding the bonding is a requirement for the design of superhard materials with improved capabilities. Here, we report a pressure-induced cubic-to-orthorhombic transition at ≈1 GPa in CrN. High-pressure X-ray diffraction and ab initio calculations show an unexpected reduction of the bulk modulus, K0, of about 25% in the high-pressure (lower volume) phase. Our combined theoretical and experimental approach shows that this effect is the result of a large exchange striction due to the approach of the localized Cr:t3 electrons to becoming molecular-orbital electrons in Cr–Cr bonds. The softening of CrN under pressure is a manifestation of a strong competition between different types of chemical bond that are found at a crossover from a localized to a molecular-orbital electronic transition."
1200,Porous organic cages,2009-10-25,"Porous materials are important in a wide range of applications including molecular separations and catalysis. We demonstrate that covalently bonded organic cages can assemble into crystalline microporous materials. The porosity is prefabricated and intrinsic to the molecular cage structure, as opposed to being formed by non-covalent self-assembly of non-porous sub-units. The three-dimensional connectivity between the cage windows is controlled by varying the chemical functionality such that either non-porous or permanently porous assemblies can be produced. Surface areas and gas uptakes for the latter exceed comparable molecular solids. One of the cages can be converted by recrystallization to produce either porous or non-porous polymorphs with apparent Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface areas of 550 and 23 m2 g−1, respectively. These results suggest design principles for responsive porous organic solids and for the modular construction of extended materials from prefabricated molecular pores."
1201,Nanofibrous biologic laminates replicate the form and function of the annulus fibrosus,2009-10-25,"Successful engineering of load-bearing tissues requires recapitulation of their complex mechanical functions. Given the intimate relationship between function and form, biomimetic materials that replicate anatomic form are of great interest for tissue engineering applications. However, for complex tissues such as the annulus fibrosus, scaffolds have failed to capture their multi-scale structural hierarchy. Consequently, engineered tissues have yet to reach functional equivalence with their native counterparts. Here, we present a novel strategy for annulus fibrosus tissue engineering that replicates this hierarchy with anisotropic nanofibrous laminates seeded with mesenchymal stem cells. These scaffolds directed the deposition of an organized, collagen-rich extracellular matrix that mimicked the angle-ply, multi-lamellar architecture and achieved mechanical parity with native tissue after 10 weeks of in vitro culture. Furthermore, we identified a novel role for inter-lamellar shearing in reinforcing the tensile response of biologic laminates, a mechanism that has not previously been considered for these tissues."
1202,Enhanced ordering temperatures in antiferromagnetic manganite superlattices,2009-10-18,"The disorder inherent to doping by cation substitution in the complex oxides can have profound effects on collective-ordered states. Here, we demonstrate that cation-site ordering achieved through digital-synthesis techniques can dramatically enhance the antiferromagnetic ordering temperatures of manganite films. Cation-ordered (LaMnO3)m/(SrMnO3)2m superlattices show Néel temperatures (TN) that are the highest of any La1−xSrxMnO3 compound, ∼70 K greater than compositionally equivalent randomly doped La1/3Sr2/3MnO3. The antiferromagnetic order is A-type, consisting of in-plane double-exchange-mediated ferromagnetic sheets coupled antiferromagnetically along the out-of-plane direction. Through synchrotron X-ray scattering, we have discovered an in-plane structural modulation that reduces the charge itinerancy and hence the ordering temperature within the ferromagnetic sheets, thereby limiting TN. This modulation is mitigated and driven to long wavelengths by cation ordering, enabling the higher TN values of the superlattices. These results provide insight into how cation-site ordering can enhance cooperative behaviour in oxides through subtle structural phenomena."
1203,Solution-deposited sodium beta-alumina gate dielectrics for low-voltage and transparent field-effect transistors,2009-10-18,"Sodium beta-alumina (SBA) has high two-dimensional conductivity, owing to mobile sodium ions in lattice planes, between which are insulating AlOx layers. SBA can provide high capacitance perpendicular to the planes, while causing negligible leakage current owing to the lack of electron carriers and limited mobility of sodium ions through the aluminium oxide layers. Here, we describe sol–gel-beta-alumina films as transistor gate dielectrics with solution-deposited zinc-oxide-based semiconductors and indium tin oxide (ITO) gate electrodes. The transistors operate in air with a few volts input. The highest electron mobility, 28.0 cm2 V−1 s−1, was from zinc tin oxide (ZTO), with an on/off ratio of 2×104. ZTO over a lower-temperature, amorphous dielectric, had a mobility of 10 cm2 V−1 s−1. We also used silicon wafer and flexible polyimide–aluminium foil substrates for solution-processed n-type oxide and organic transistors. Using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulphonate) conducting polymer electrodes, we prepared an all-solution-processed, low-voltage transparent oxide transistor on an ITO glass substrate."
1204,Non-entropic and reversible long-range deformation of an encapsulating bioelastomer,2009-10-18,"Encapsulation is a widespread biological process particularly in the formation of protective egg cases of oviparous animals. The egg capsule wall of the channelled whelk Busycon canaliculum is an effective shock absorber with high reversible extensibility and a stiffness that changes significantly during extension. Here we show that post-stretch recovery in egg capsules is not driven by entropic forces as it is in rubber. Indeed, at fixed strain, force decreases linearly with increasing temperature, whereas in rubber elasticity the force increases. Instead, capsule wall recovery is associated with the internal energy arising from the facile and reversible structural α-helix -sheet transition of egg capsule proteins during extension. This behaviour is extraordinary in the magnitude of energy dissipated and speed of recovery and is reminiscent of strain-induced crystallization in some polymeric fibres and of superelastic deformations associated with diffusionless phase transitions in shape-memory alloys."
1205,Material properties of the cell dictate stress-induced spreading and differentiation in embryonic stem cells,2009-10-18,"Growing evidence suggests that physical microenvironments and mechanical stresses, in addition to soluble factors, help direct mesenchymal-stem-cell fate. However, biological responses to a local force in embryonic stem cells remain elusive. Here we show that a local cyclic stress through focal adhesions induced spreading in mouse embryonic stem cells but not in mouse embryonic stem-cell-differentiated cells, which were ten times stiffer. This response was dictated by the cell material property (cell softness), suggesting that a threshold cell deformation is the key setpoint for triggering spreading responses. Traction quantification and pharmacological or shRNA intervention revealed that myosin II contractility, F-actin, Src or cdc42 were essential in the spreading response. The applied stress led to oct3/4 gene downregulation in mES cells. Our findings demonstrate that cell softness dictates cellular sensitivity to force, suggesting that local small forces might have far more important roles in early development of soft embryos than previously appreciated."
1206,Small-molecule-directed nanoparticle assembly towards stimuli-responsive nanocomposites,2009-10-18,"Precise control of the spatial organization of nanoscopic building blocks, such as nanoparticles, over multiple length scales is a bottleneck in the ‘bottom-up’ generation of technologically important materials. Only a few approaches have been shown to achieve nanoparticle assemblies without surface modification. We demonstrate a simple yet versatile approach to produce stimuli-responsive hierarchical assemblies of readily available nanoparticles by combining small molecules and block copolymers. Organization of nanoparticles into one-, two- and three-dimensional arrays with controlled inter-particle separation and ordering is achieved without chemical modification of either the nanoparticles or block copolymers. Nanocomposites responsive to heat and light are demonstrated, where the spatial distribution of the nanoparticles can be varied by exposure to heat or light or changing the local environment. The approach described is applicable to a wide range of nanoparticles and compatible with existing fabrication processes, thereby enabling a non-disruptive approach for the generation of functional devices."
1207,On the origin of the open-circuit voltage of polymer–fullerene solar cells,2009-10-11,"The increasing amount of research on solution-processable, organic donor–acceptor bulk heterojunction photovoltaic systems, based on blends of conjugated polymers and fullerenes has resulted in devices with an overall power-conversion efficiency of 6%. For the best devices, absorbed photon-to-electron quantum efficiencies approaching 100% have been shown. Besides the produced current, the overall efficiency depends critically on the generated photovoltage. Therefore, understanding and optimization of the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of organic solar cells is of high importance. Here, we demonstrate that charge-transfer absorption and emission are shown to be related to each other and Voc in accordance with the assumptions of the detailed balance and quasi-equilibrium theory. We underline the importance of the weak ground-state interaction between the polymer and the fullerene and we confirm that Voc is determined by the formation of these states. Our work further suggests alternative pathways to improve Voc of donor–acceptor devices."
1208,Morphology-dependent zeolite intergrowth structures leading to distinct internal and outer-surface molecular diffusion barriers,2009-09-20,"Zeolites play a crucial part in acid–base heterogeneous catalysis. Fundamental insight into their internal architecture is of great importance for understanding their structure–function relationships. Here, we report on a new approach correlating confocal fluorescence microscopy with focused ion beam–electron backscatter diffraction, transmission electron microscopy lamelling and diffraction, atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to study a wide range of coffin-shaped MFI-type zeolite crystals differing in their morphology and chemical composition. This powerful combination demonstrates a unified view on the morphology-dependent MFI-type intergrowth structures and provides evidence for the presence and nature of internal and outer-surface barriers for molecular diffusion. It has been found that internal-surface barriers originate not only from a 90∘ mismatch in structure and pore alignment but also from small angle differences of 0.5∘–2∘ for particular crystal morphologies. Furthermore, outer-surface barriers seem to be composed of a silicalite outer crust with a thickness varying from 10 to 200 nm."
1209,The effect of nanometre-scale structure on interfacial energy,2009-09-13,"Natural surfaces are often structured with nanometre-scale domains, yet a framework providing a quantitative understanding of how nanostructure affects interfacial energy, γSL, is lacking. Conventional continuum thermodynamics treats γSL solely as a function of average composition, ignoring structure. Here we show that, when a surface has domains commensurate in size with solvent molecules, γSL is determined not only by its average composition but also by a structural component that causes γSL to deviate from the continuum prediction by a substantial amount, as much as 20% in our system. By contrasting surfaces coated with either molecular- (<2 nm) or larger-scale domains (>5 nm), we find that whereas the latter surfaces have the expected linear dependence of γSL on surface composition, the former show a markedly different non-monotonic trend. Molecular dynamics simulations show how the organization of the solvent molecules at the interface is controlled by the nanostructured surface, which in turn appreciably modifies γSL."
1210,The effect of three-dimensional morphology on the efficiency of hybrid polymer solar cells,2009-09-13,"The efficiency of polymer solar cells critically depends on the intimacy of mixing of the donor and acceptor semiconductors used in these devices to create charges and on the presence of unhindered percolation pathways in the individual components to transport holes and electrons. The visualization of these bulk heterojunction morphologies in three dimensions has been challenging and has hampered progress in this area. Here, we spatially resolve the morphology of 2%-efficient hybrid solar cells consisting of poly(3-hexylthiophene) as the donor and ZnO as the acceptor in the nanometre range by electron tomography. The morphology is statistically analysed for spherical contact distance and percolation pathways. Together with solving the three-dimensional exciton-diffusion equation, a consistent and quantitative correlation between solar-cell performance, photophysical data and the three-dimensional morphology has been obtained for devices with different layer thicknesses that enables differentiating between generation and transport as limiting factors to performance."
1211,One-dimensional imidazole aggregate in aluminium porous coordination polymers with high proton conductivity,2009-09-06,"The development of anhydrous proton-conductive materials operating at temperatures above 80 ∘C is a challenge that needs to be met for practical applications. Herein, we propose the new idea of encapsulation of a proton-carrier molecule—imidazole in this work—in aluminium porous coordination polymers for the creation of a hybridized proton conductor under anhydrous conditions. Tuning of the host–guest interaction can generate a good proton-conducting path at temperatures above 100 ∘C. The dynamics of the adsorbed imidazole strongly affect the conductivity determined by 2H solid-state NMR. Isotope measurements of conductivity using imidazole-d4 showed that the proton-hopping mechanism was dominant for the conducting path. This work suggests that the combination of guest molecules and a variety of microporous frameworks would afford highly mobile proton carriers in solids and gives an idea for designing a new type of proton conductor, particularly for high-temperature and anhydrous conditions."
1212,"Spotted vesicles, striped micelles and Janus assemblies induced by ligand binding",2009-09-06,"Selective binding of multivalent ligands within a mixture of polyvalent amphiphiles provides, in principle, a simple mechanism for driving domain formation in self-assemblies. Divalent cations are shown here to crossbridge polyanionic amphiphiles, which thereby demix from neutral amphiphiles and form spots or rafts within vesicles as well as stripes within cylindrical micelles. Calcium- and copper-crossbridged domains of synthetic block copolymers or natural lipid (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate) possess tunable sizes, shapes and/or spacings that can last for years. Lateral segregation in these ‘ligand-responsive Janus assemblies’ couples weakly to curvature and proves to be restricted within phase diagrams to narrow regimes of pH and cation concentration that are centred near the characteristic binding constants for polyacid interactions. Remixing at high pH is surprising, but a theory for strong lateral segregation shows that counterion entropy dominates electrostatic crossbridges, thus illustrating the insights gained into ligand-induced pattern formation within self-assemblies."
1213,Electrostatic spin crossover effect in polar magnetic molecules,2009-08-30,"The magnetic configuration of a nanostructure can be altered by an external magnetic field, by spin-transfer torque or by its magnetoelastic response. Here, we explore an alternative route, namely the possibility of switching the sign of the exchange coupling between two magnetic centres by means of an electric potential. This general effect, which we name electrostatic spin crossover, occurs in insulating molecules with super-exchange magnetic interaction and inversion symmetry breaking. As an example we present the case of a family of di-cobaltocene-based molecules. The critical fields for switching, calculated from first principles, are of the order of 1 V nm−1 and can be achieved in two-terminal devices. More crucially, such critical fields can be engineered with an appropriate choice of substituents to add to the basic di-cobaltocene unit. This suggests that an easy chemical strategy for achieving the synthesis of suitable molecules is possible."
1214,Nitrogen interaction with hydrogen-terminated silicon surfaces at the atomic scale,2009-08-16,"Passivation of semiconductor surfaces is conveniently realized by terminating surface dangling bonds with a monovalent atom such as hydrogen using a simple wet chemical process (for example, HF treatment for silicon). However, the real potential of surface chemical passivation lies in the ability to replace surface hydrogen by multivalent atoms to form surfaces with tailored properties. Although some progress has been made to attach organic layers on top of H-terminated surfaces, it has been more challenging to understand and control the incorporation of multivalent atoms, such as oxygen and nitrogen, within the top surface layer of H-terminated surfaces. The difficulty arises partly because such processes are dominated by defect sites. Here, we report mechanistic pathways involved in the nitridation of H-terminated silicon surfaces using ammonia vapour. Surface infrared spectroscopy and first-principles calculations clearly show that the initial interaction is dominated by the details of the surface morphology (defect structure) and that NH and NH2 are precursors to N insertion into Si–Si bonds. For the dihydride-stepped Si(111) surface, a unique reaction pathway is identified leading to selective silazane step-edge formation at the lowest reaction temperatures."
1215,Comparative materials differences revealed in engineered bone as a function of cell-specific differentiation,2009-07-26,"An important aim of regenerative medicine is to restore tissue function with implantable, laboratory-grown constructs that contain tissue-specific cells that replicate the function of their counterparts in the healthy native tissue. It remains unclear, however, whether cells used in bone regeneration applications produce a material that mimics the structural and compositional complexity of native bone. By applying multivariate analysis techniques to micro-Raman spectra of mineralized nodules formed in vitro, we reveal cell-source-dependent differences in interactions between multiple bone-like mineral environments. Although osteoblasts and adult stem cells exhibited bone-specific biological activities and created a material with many of the hallmarks of native bone, the ‘bone nodules’ formed from embryonic stem cells were an order of magnitude less stiff, and lacked the distinctive nanolevel architecture and complex biomolecular and mineral composition noted in the native tissue. Understanding the biological mechanisms of bone formation in vitro that contribute to cell-source-specific materials differences may facilitate the development of clinically successful engineered bone."
1216,A general phase-transfer protocol for metal ions and its application in nanocrystal synthesis,2009-07-13,"Nanocrystals prepared in organic media can be easily self-assembled into close-packed hexagonal monolayers on solvent evaporation for various applications. However, they usually rely on the use of organometallic precursors that are soluble in organic solvents. Herein we report a general protocol to transfer metal ions from an aqueous solution to an organic medium, which involves mixing the aqueous solution of metal ions with an ethanolic solution of dodecylamine (DDA), and extracting the coordinating compounds formed between the metal ions and DDA into toluene. This approach could be applied towards transferring a wide variety of transition-metal ions with an efficiency of >95%, and enables the synthesis of a variety of metallic and semiconductor nanocrystals to be carried out in an organic medium using relatively inexpensive water-soluble metal salts as starting materials. This protocol could be easily extended to synthesize a variety of heterogeneous semiconductor/noble-metal hybrids and to nanocomposites with multiple functionalities."
1217,Plasmonic analogue of electromagnetically induced transparency at the Drude damping limit,2009-07-05,"In atomic physics, the coherent coupling of a broad and a narrow resonance leads to quantum interference and provides the general recipe for electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). A sharp resonance of nearly perfect transmission can arise within a broad absorption profile. These features show remarkable potential for slow light, novel sensors and low-loss metamaterials. In nanophotonics, plasmonic structures enable large field strengths within small mode volumes. Therefore, combining EIT with nanoplasmonics would pave the way towards ultracompact sensors with extremely high sensitivity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a nanoplasmonic analogue of EIT using a stacked optical metamaterial. A dipole antenna with a large radiatively broadened linewidth is coupled to an underlying quadrupole antenna, of which the narrow linewidth is solely limited by the fundamental non-radiative Drude damping. In accordance with EIT theory, we achieve a very narrow transparency window with high modulation depth owing to nearly complete suppression of radiative losses."
1218,Selective positioning of organic dyes in a mesoporous inorganic oxide film,2009-06-28,"Although sequential adsorption of dyes in a single TiO2 electrode is ideal to extend the range of light absorption in dye-sensitized solar cells, high-temperature processing has so far limited its application. We report a method for selective positioning of organic dye molecules with different absorption ranges in a mesoporous TiO2 film by mimicking the concept of the stationary phase and the mobile phase in column chromatography, where polystyrene-filled mesoporous TiO2 film is explored for use as a stationary phase and a Brønsted-base-containing polymer solution is developed for use as a mobile phase for selective desorption of the adsorbed dye. By controlling the desorption and adsorption depth, yellow, red and green dyes were vertically aligned within a TiO2 film, which is confirmed by an electron probe micro-analyser. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum from a solar cell with three selectively positioned dyes reveals the EQE characteristics of each single-dye cell."
1219,Printed artificial cilia from liquid-crystal network actuators modularly driven by light,2009-06-28,"Polymeric microactuators are potentially useful in micromechanical systems and lab-on-a-chip systems. However, manufacturing of miniature polymeric actuators has been complicated owing to the necessity of including electrodes for actuation or using lithographic techniques for patterning. Here, we demonstrate that all-polymer microdevices can be fabricated using inkjet printing technology in combination with self-organizing liquid-crystal network actuators. We exploit the self-assembling properties of the liquid crystal to create large strain gradients, and light-driven actuation is chosen to allow simple and remote addressing. By using multiple inks, microactuators with different subunits are created that can be selectively addressed by changing the wavelength of the light. The actuators mimic the motion of natural cilia. These artificial cilia have the potential to create flow and mixing in wet environments such as lab-on-a-chip applications. The process is easily adapted for roll-to-roll fabrication, allowing for large-scale and low-cost production of miniaturized active polymer systems."
1220,The dynamic organic p–n junction,2009-06-21,"Static p–n junctions in inorganic semiconductors are exploited in a wide range of today’s electronic appliances. Here, we demonstrate the in situ formation of a dynamic p–n junction structure within an organic semiconductor through electrochemistry. Specifically, we use scanning kelvin probe microscopy and optical probing on planar light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) with a mixture of a conjugated polymer and an electrolyte connecting two electrodes separated by 120 μm. We find that a significant portion of the potential drop between the electrodes coincides with the location of a thin and distinct light-emission zone positioned >30 μm away from the negative electrode. These results are relevant in the context of a long-standing scientific debate, as they prove that electrochemical doping can take place in LECs. Moreover, a study on the doping formation and dissipation kinetics provides interesting detail regarding the electronic structure and stability of the dynamic organic p–n junction, which may be useful in future dynamic p–n junction-based devices."
1221,Linking a completely three-dimensional nanostrain to a structural transformation eigenstrain,2009-06-21,"Ni–Ti is one of the most popular shape-memory alloys, a phenomenon resulting from a martensitic transformation. Commercial Ni–Ti-based alloys are often thermally treated to contain Ni4Ti3 precipitates. The presence of these precipitates can introduce an extra transformation step related to the so-called R-phase. It is believed that the strain field surrounding the precipitates, caused by the matrix–precipitate lattice mismatch, lies at the origin of this intermediate transformation step. Atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy in combination with geometrical phase analysis is used to measure the elastic strain field surrounding these precipitates. By combining measurements from two different crystallographic directions, the three-dimensional strain matrix is determined from two-dimensional measurements. Comparison of the measured strain matrix to the eigenstrain of the R-phase shows that both are very similar and that the introduction of the R-phase might indeed compensate the elastic strain introduced by the precipitate."
1222,Inhomogeneous flow and fracture of glassy materials,2009-06-14,"The fracture mechanism of amorphous materials, which are of crucial importance in various fields of engineering, remains a long-standing fundamental problem of science despite intensive efforts over the years. On the basis of a novel rheological model of fracture, we demonstrate that nonlinear behaviour associated with fracture is a consequence of the coupling between density fluctuations and deformation fields: shear-induced enhancement of density fluctuations is self-amplified by the resulting enhancement of dynamic and elastic asymmetry between denser and less-dense regions. This positive feedback may be the origin of fracture. We propose novel criteria for the onset of mechanical instability, extending from ductile to brittle fracture. Their validity is checked by comparing them with numerical solutions of our model and existing experimental results of metallic and polymeric glass formers. The criteria enable us to predict and design fracture behaviour of materials from the pressure dependence of their viscoelastic properties."
1223,Templated formation of giant polymer vesicles with controlled size distributions,2009-05-17,"Unilamellar polymer vesicles are formed when a block copolymer self-assembles to form a single bilayer structure, with a hydrophobic core and hydrophilic surfaces, and the resulting membrane folds over and rearranges by connecting its edges to enclose a space. The physics of self-assembly tightly specifies the wall thickness of the resulting vesicle, but, both for polymer vesicles and phospholipids, no mechanism strongly selects for the overall size, so the size distribution of vesicles tends to be very polydisperse. We report a method for the production of controlled size distributions of micrometre-sized (that is, giant) vesicles combining the ‘top-down’ control of micrometre-sized features (vesicle diameter) by photolithography and dewetting with the ‘bottom-up’ control of nanometre-sized features (membrane thickness) by molecular self-assembly. It enables the spontaneous creation of unilamellar vesicles with a narrow size distribution that could find applications in drug and gene delivery, nano- and micro-reactors, substrates for macromolecular crystallography and model systems for studies of membrane function."
1224,A highly ordered nanostructured carbon–sulphur cathode for lithium–sulphur batteries,2009-05-17,"The Li–S battery has been under intense scrutiny for over two decades, as it offers the possibility of high gravimetric capacities and theoretical energy densities ranging up to a factor of five beyond conventional Li-ion systems. Herein, we report the feasibility to approach such capacities by creating highly ordered interwoven composites. The conductive mesoporous carbon framework precisely constrains sulphur nanofiller growth within its channels and generates essential electrical contact to the insulating sulphur. The structure provides access to Li+ ingress/egress for reactivity with the sulphur, and we speculate that the kinetic inhibition to diffusion within the framework and the sorption properties of the carbon aid in trapping the polysulphides formed during redox. Polymer modification of the carbon surface further provides a chemical gradient that retards diffusion of these large anions out of the electrode, thus facilitating more complete reaction. Reversible capacities up to 1,320 mA h g−1 are attained. The assembly process is simple and broadly applicable, conceptually providing new opportunities for materials scientists for tailored design that can be extended to many different electrode materials."
1225,Stretchable active-matrix organic light-emitting diode display using printable elastic conductors,2009-05-10,"Stretchability will significantly expand the applications scope of electronics, particularly for large-area electronic displays, sensors and actuators. Unlike for conventional devices, stretchable electronics can cover arbitrary surfaces and movable parts. However, a large hurdle is the manufacture of large-area highly stretchable electrical wirings with high conductivity. Here, we describe the manufacture of printable elastic conductors comprising single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) uniformly dispersed in a fluorinated rubber. Using an ionic liquid and jet-milling, we produce long and fine SWNT bundles that can form well-developed conducting networks in the rubber. Conductivity of more than 100 S cm−1 and stretchability of more than 100% are obtained. Making full use of this extraordinary conductivity, we constructed a rubber-like stretchable active-matrix display comprising integrated printed elastic conductors, organic transistors and organic light-emitting diodes. The display could be stretched by 30–50% and spread over a hemisphere without any mechanical or electrical damage."
1226,Free-standing nanoparticle superlattice sheets controlled by DNA,2009-05-03,"Free-standing nanoparticle superlattices (suspended highly ordered nanoparticle arrays) are ideal for designing metamaterials and nanodevices free of substrate-induced electromagnetic interference. Here, we report on the first DNA-based route towards monolayered free-standing nanoparticle superlattices. In an unconventional way, DNA was used as a ‘dry ligand’ in a microhole-confined, drying-mediated self-assembly process. Without the requirement of specific Watson–Crick base-pairing, we obtained discrete, free-standing superlattice sheets in which both structure (inter-particle spacings) and functional properties (plasmonic and mechanical) can be rationally controlled by adjusting DNA length. In particular, the edge-to-edge inter-particle spacing for monolayered superlattice sheets can be tuned up to 20 nm, which is a much wider range than has been achieved with alkyl molecular ligands. Our method opens a simple yet efficient avenue towards the assembly of artificial nanoparticle solids in their ultimate thickness limit—a promising step that may enable the integration of free-standing superlattices into solid-state nanodevices."
1227,Intravaginal gene silencing using biodegradable polymer nanoparticles densely loaded with small-interfering RNA,2009-05-03,"Vaginal instillation of small-interfering RNA (siRNA) using liposomes has led to silencing of endogenous genes in the genital tract and protection against challenge from infectious disease. Although siRNA lipoplexes are easily formulated, several of the most effective transfection agents available commercially may be toxic to the mucosal epithelia and none are able to provide controlled or sustained release. Here, we demonstrate an alternative approach using nanoparticles composed entirely of FDA-approved materials. To render these materials effective for gene silencing, we developed novel approaches to load them with high amounts of siRNA. A single dose of siRNA-loaded nanoparticles to the mouse female reproductive tract caused efficient and sustained gene silencing. Knockdown of gene expression was observed proximal (in the vaginal lumen) and distal (in the uterine horns) to the site of topical delivery. In addition, nanoparticles penetrated deep into the epithelial tissue. This is the first report demonstrating that biodegradable polymer nanoparticles are effective delivery vehicles for siRNA to the vaginal mucosa."
1228,Electric modulation of conduction in multiferroic Ca-doped BiFeO,2009-04-26,"Many interesting materials phenomena such as the emergence of high-Tc superconductivity in the cuprates and colossal magnetoresistance in the manganites arise out of a doping-driven competition between energetically similar ground states. Doped multiferroics present a tantalizing evolution of this generic concept of phase competition. Here, we present the observation of an electronic conductor–insulator transition by control of band-filling in the model antiferromagnetic ferroelectric BiFeO3 through Ca doping. Application of electric field enables us to control and manipulate this electronic transition to the extent that a p–n junction can be created, erased and inverted in this material. A ‘dome-like’ feature in the doping dependence of the ferroelectric transition is observed around a Ca concentration of ∼1/8, where a new pseudo-tetragonal phase appears and the electric modulation of conduction is optimized. Possible mechanisms for the observed effects are discussed on the basis of the interplay of ionic and electronic conduction. This observation opens the door to merging magnetoelectrics and magnetoelectronics at room temperature by combining electronic conduction with electric and magnetic degrees of freedom already present in the multiferroic BiFeO3."
1229,From chessboard tweed to chessboard nanowire structure during pseudospinodal decomposition,2009-04-19,"Microstructure evolution in complex nonlinear systems is of great interest from both scientific and engineering viewpoints. Here, we consider an important case of such an evolution, a coherent decomposition of a homogeneous parent phase involving the symmetry-lifting crystal lattice rearrangement of the product phase. It is shown that under certain conditions the transformation develops as a pseudospinodal decomposition, which is defined as a transformation with continuous changes of the compositions of both decomposed phases towards their equilibrium values. The pseudospinodal decomposition starts by the formation of a nanodomain precursor state with a so-called tweed structure. The three-dimensional modelling demonstrates that this tweed structure has an underlying chessboard feature, and this arrangement is a template for the further microstructure development that eventually produces a coherent two-phase chessboard nanowire pattern. The proposed theory and modelling describe the mechanism of the pseudospinodal decomposition and predict all observed three-dimensional features of the chessboard structure."
1230,Spraying asymmetry into functional membranes layer-by-layer,2009-04-19,"As engineers strive to mimic the form and function of naturally occurring materials with synthetic alternatives, the challenges and costs of processing often limit creative innovation. Here we describe a powerful yet economical technique for developing multiple coatings of different morphologies and functions within a single textile membrane, enabling scientists to engineer the properties of a material from the nanoscopic level in commercially viable quantities. By simply varying the flow rate of charged species passing through an electrospun material during spray-assisted layer-by-layer deposition, individual fibres within the matrix can be conformally functionalized for ultrahigh-surface-area catalysis, or bridged to form a networked sublayer with complimentary properties. Exemplified here by the creation of selectively reactive gas purification membranes, the myriad applications of this technology also include self-cleaning fabrics, water purification and protein functionalization of scaffolds for tissue engineering."
1231,Enhancement of ferroelectricity at metal–oxide interfaces,2009-04-19,"The development of ultrathin ferroelectric capacitors for use in memory applications has been hampered by depolarization effects arising from the electrode–film interfaces. These can be characterized in terms of a reduced interface capacitance, or equivalently an ‘effective dead layer’ in contact with the electrode. Here, by performing first-principles calculations on four capacitor structures based on BaTiO3 and PbTiO3, we determine the intrinsic interfacial effects responsible for destabilizing the ferroelectric state in ultrathin-film devices. Although it has been widely believed that these are governed by the electronic screening properties at the interface, we show that they also depend crucially on the local chemical environment through the force constants of the metal oxide bonds. In particular, in the case of interfaces formed between AO-terminated perovskites and simple metals, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of interfacial ferroelectricity that produces an overall enhancement of the ferroelectric instability of the film, rather than its suppression as is usually assumed. The resulting ‘negative dead layer’ suggests a route to thin-film ferroelectric devices that are free of deleterious size effects."
1232,The role of viscous flow of oxide in the growth of self-ordered porous anodic alumina films,2009-04-12,"Porous anodic alumina (PAA) films are widely used as templates for functional nanostructures, because of the high regularity and controllability of the pore morphology. However, growth mechanisms have not yet been developed that can explain quantitative relationships between processing conditions and oxide layer geometry. Here, we present a model for steady-state growth of these amorphous films, incorporating the novel feature that metal and oxygen ions are transported by coupled electrical migration and viscous flow. The oxide flow in the model arises near the film–solution interface at the pore bottoms, in response to the constraint of volume conservation. The hypothesis of viscous flow was successfully validated through detailed comparisons to observations of the motion of tungsten tracers in the film. Predictions of localized tensile stress near nanoscale ridges at the metal–film interface were supported by observations of voids at these sites. We suggest that the ordering of PAA may be explained by a mechanism in which metal–film interface motion is regulated by the combination of ionic migration in the oxide and stress-driven interface diffusion of metal atoms."
1233,Towards high charge-carrier mobilities by rational design of the shape and periphery of discotics,2009-04-12,"Discotic liquid crystals are a promising class of materials for molecular electronics thanks to their self-organization and charge transporting properties. The best discotics so far are built around the coronene unit and possess six-fold symmetry. In the discotic phase six-fold-symmetric molecules stack with an average twist of 30∘, whereas the angle that would lead to the greatest electronic coupling is 60∘. Here, a molecule with three-fold symmetry and alternating hydrophilic/hydrophobic side chains is synthesized and X-ray scattering is used to prove the formation of the desired helical microstructure. Time-resolved microwave-conductivity measurements show that the material has indeed a very high mobility, 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1. The assemblies of molecules are simulated using molecular dynamics, confirming the model deduced from X-ray scattering. The simulated structures, together with quantum-chemical techniques, prove that mobility is still limited by structural defects and that a defect-free assembly could lead to mobilities in excess of 10 cm2 V−1 s−1."
1234,The preparation and structure of salty ice VII under pressure,2009-04-06,"It is widely accepted that ice, no matter what phase, is unable to incorporate large amounts of salt into its structure. This conclusion is based on the observation that on freezing of salt water, ice expels the salt almost entirely as brine. Here, we show that this behaviour is not an intrinsic physico-chemical property of ice phases. We demonstrate by neutron diffraction that substantial amounts of dissolved LiCl can be built homogeneously into the ice VII structure if it is produced by recrystallization of its glassy (amorphous) state under pressure. Such ‘alloyed’ ice VII has significantly different structural properties compared with pure ice VII, such as an 8% larger unit cell volume, 5 times larger displacement factors, an absence of a transition to an ordered ice VIII structure and plasticity. Our study suggests that there could be a whole new class of ‘salty’ high-pressure ice forms."
1235,Synergetic combination of different types of defect to optimize pinning landscape using BaZrO,2009-04-06,"Retaining a dissipation-free state while carrying large electrical currents is a challenge that needs to be solved to enable commercial applications of high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we show that the controlled combination of two effective pinning centres (randomly distributed nanoparticles and self-assembled columnar defects) is possible and effective. By simply changing the temperature or growth rate during pulsed-laser deposition of BaZrO3-doped YBa2Cu3O7 films, we can vary the ratio of these defects, tuning the field and angular critical-current (Ic) performance to maximize Ic. We show that the defects’ microstructure is governed by the growth kinetics and that the best results are obtained with a mixture of splayed columnar defects and random nanoparticles. The very high Ic arises from a complex vortex pinning landscape where columnar defects provide large pinning energy, while splay and nanoparticles inhibit flux creep. This knowledge is used to produce thick films with remarkable Ic(H) and nearly isotropic angle dependence."
1236,A cell-free protein-producing gel,2009-03-29,"Proteins are important biomaterials and are generally produced in living cells. Here, we show a novel DNA hydrogel that is capable of producing functional proteins without any living cells. This protein-producing gel (termed ‘the P-gel system’ or ‘P-gel’) consists of genes as part of the gel scaffolding. This is the first time that a hydrogel has been used to produce proteins. The efficiency was about 300 times higher than current, solution-based systems. In terms of volumetric yield, the P-gel produced up to 5 mg ml−1 of functional proteins. The mechanisms behind the high efficiency and yield include improved gene stability, higher local concentration and a faster enzyme turnover rate due to a closer proximity of genes. We have tested a total of 16 different P-gels and have successfully produced all 16 proteins including membrane and toxic proteins, demonstrating that the P-gel system can serve as a general protein production technology."
1237,Anisotropic self-assembly of spherical polymer-grafted nanoparticles,2009-03-22,"It is easy to understand the self-assembly of particles with anisotropic shapes or interactions (for example, cobalt nanoparticles or proteins) into highly extended structures. However, there is no experimentally established strategy for creating a range of anisotropic structures from common spherical nanoparticles. We demonstrate that spherical nanoparticles uniformly grafted with macromolecules (‘nanoparticle amphiphiles’) robustly self-assemble into a variety of anisotropic superstructures when they are dispersed in the corresponding homopolymer matrix. Theory and simulations suggest that this self-assembly reflects a balance between the energy gain when particle cores approach and the entropy of distorting the grafted polymers. The effectively directional nature of the particle interactions is thus a many-body emergent property. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach to nanoparticle self-assembly enables considerable control for the creation of polymer nanocomposites with enhanced mechanical properties. Grafted nanoparticles are thus versatile building blocks for creating tunable and functional particle superstructures with significant practical applications."
1238,Cloning polymer single crystals through self-seeding,2009-03-15,"In general, when a crystal is molten, all molecules forget about their mutual correlations and long-range order is lost. Thus, a regrown crystal does not inherit any features from an initially present crystal. Such is true for materials exhibiting a well-defined melting point. However, polymer crystallites have a wide range of melting temperatures, enabling paradoxical phenomena such as the coexistence of melting and crystallization. Here, we report a self-seeding technique that enables the generation of arrays of orientation-correlated polymer crystals of uniform size and shape (‘clones’) with their orientation inherited from an initial single crystal. Moreover, the number density and locations of these cloned crystals can to some extent be predetermined through the thermal history of the starting crystal. We attribute this unique behaviour of polymers to the coexistence of variable fold lengths in metastable crystalline lamellae, typical for ordering of complex chain-like molecules."
1239,A one-dimensional ice structure built from pentagons,2009-03-08,"Heterogeneous ice nucleation has a key role in fields as diverse as atmospheric chemistry and biology. Ice nucleation on metal surfaces affords an opportunity to watch this process unfold at the molecular scale on a well-defined, planar interface. A common feature of structural models for such films is that they are built from hexagonal arrangements of molecules. Here we show, through a combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and density-functional theory, that about 1-nm-wide ice chains that nucleate on Cu(110) are not built from hexagons, but instead are built from a face-sharing arrangement of water pentagons. The pentagon structure is favoured over others because it maximizes the water–metal bonding while maintaining a strong hydrogen-bonding network. It reveals an unanticipated structural adaptability of water–ice films, demonstrating that the presence of the substrate can be sufficient to favour non-hexagonal structural units."
1240,Hidden order in URu,2009-02-22,"Spontaneous, collective ordering of electronic degrees of freedom leads to second-order phase transitions that are characterized by an order parameter driving the transition. The notion of a ‘hidden order’ has recently been used for a variety of materials where a clear phase transition occurs without a known order parameter. The prototype example is the heavy-fermion compound URu2Si2, where a mysterious hidden-order transition occurs at 17.5 K. For more than twenty years this system has been studied theoretically and experimentally without a firm grasp of the underlying physics. Here, we provide a microscopic explanation of the hidden order using density-functional theory calculations. We identify the Fermi surface ‘hot spots’ where degeneracy induces a Fermi surface instability and quantify how symmetry breaking lifts the degeneracy, causing a surprisingly large Fermi surface gapping. As the mechanism for the hidden order, we deduce spontaneous symmetry breaking through a dynamic mode of antiferromagnetic moment excitations."
1241,The influence of edge structure on the electronic properties of graphene quantum dots and nanoribbons,2009-02-15,"Graphene shows promise as a future material for nanoelectronics owing to its compatibility with industry-standard lithographic processing, electron mobilities up to 150 times greater than Si and a thermal conductivity twice that of diamond. The electronic structure of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and quantum dots (GQDs) has been predicted to depend sensitively on the crystallographic orientation of their edges; however, the influence of edge structure has not been verified experimentally. Here, we use tunnelling spectroscopy to show that the electronic structure of GNRs and GQDs with 2–20 nm lateral dimensions varies on the basis of the graphene edge lattice symmetry. Predominantly zigzag-edge GQDs with 7–8 nm average dimensions are metallic owing to the presence of zigzag edge states. GNRs with a higher fraction of zigzag edges exhibit a smaller energy gap than a predominantly armchair-edge ribbon of similar width, and the magnitudes of the measured GNR energy gaps agree with recent theoretical calculations."
1242,Ferroelectricity and polarity control in solid-state flip-flop supramolecular rotators,2009-02-08,"Molecular rotation has attracted much attention with respect to the development of artificial molecular motors, in an attempt to mimic the intelligent and useful functions of biological molecular motors. Random motion of molecular rotators—for example the 180∘ flip-flop motion of a rotatory unit—causes a rotation of the local structure. Here, we show that such motion is controllable using an external electric field and demonstrate how such molecular rotators can be used as polarization rotation units in ferroelectric molecules. In particular, m-fluoroanilinium forms a hydrogen-bonding assembly with dibenzo[18]crown-6, which was introduced as the counter cation of [Ni(dmit)2]− anions (dmit2−=2-thioxo-1,3-dithiole-4,5-dithiolate). The supramolecular rotator of m-fluoroanilinium exhibited dipole rotation by the application of an electric field, and the crystal showed a ferroelectric transition at 348 K. These findings will open up new strategies for ferroelectric molecules where a chemically designed dipole unit enables control of the nature of the ferroelectric transition temperature."
1243,Conduction at domain walls in oxide multiferroics,2009-01-25,"Domain walls may play an important role in future electronic devices, given their small size as well as the fact that their location can be controlled. Here, we report the observation of room-temperature electronic conductivity at ferroelectric domain walls in the insulating multiferroic BiFeO3. The origin and nature of the observed conductivity are probed using a combination of conductive atomic force microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and first-principles density functional computations. Our analyses indicate that the conductivity correlates with structurally driven changes in both the electrostatic potential and the local electronic structure, which shows a decrease in the bandgap at the domain wall. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential for device applications of such conducting nanoscale features."
1244,Shear-induced anisotropic plastic flow from body-centred-cubic tantalum before melting,2009-01-25,"There are many structural and optical similarities between a liquid and a plastic flow. Thus, it is non-trivial to distinguish between them at high pressures and temperatures, and a detailed description of the transformation between these phenomena is crucial to our understanding of the melting of metals at high pressures. Here we report a shear-induced, partially disordered viscous plastic flow from body-centred-cubic tantalum under heating before it melts into a liquid. This thermally activated structural transformation produces a unique, one-dimensional structure analogous to a liquid crystal with the rheological characteristics of Bingham plastics. This mechanism is not specific to Ta and is expected to hold more generally for other metals. Remarkably, this transition is fully consistent with the previously reported anomalously low-temperature melting curve and thus offers a plausible resolution to a long-standing controversy about melting of metals under high pressures."
1245,Conjugated dicarboxylate anodes for Li-ion batteries,2009-01-18,"Present Li-ion batteries for portable electronics are based on inorganic electrodes. For upcoming large-scale applications the notion of materials sustainability produced by materials made through eco-efficient processes, such as renewable organic electrodes, is crucial. We here report on two organic salts, Li2C8H4O4 (Li terephthalate) and Li2C6H4O4(Li trans–trans-muconate), with carboxylate groups conjugated within the molecular core, which are respectively capable of reacting with two and one extra Li per formula unit at potentials of 0.8 and 1.4 V, giving reversible capacities of 300 and 150 mA h g−1. The activity is maintained at 80 ∘C with polyethyleneoxide-based electrolytes. A noteworthy advantage of the Li2C8H4O4 and Li2C6H4O4 negative electrodes is their enhanced thermal stability over carbon electrodes in 1 M LiPF6 ethylene carbonate–dimethyl carbonate electrolytes, which should result in safer Li-ion cells. Moreover, as bio-inspired materials, both compounds are the metabolites of aromatic hydrocarbon oxidation, and terephthalic acid is available in abundance from the recycling of polyethylene terephthalate."
1246,Tuning selectivity in catalysis by controlling particle shape,2009-01-18,"A catalytic process for the selective formation of cis olefins would help minimize the production of unhealthy trans fats during the partial hydrogenation of edible oils. Here we report on the design of such a process on the basis of studies with model systems. Temperature programmed desorption data on single crystals showed that the isomerization of trans olefins to their cis counterparts is promoted by (111) facets of platinum, and that such selectivity is reversed on more open surfaces. Quantum mechanics calculations suggested that the extra stability of cis olefins seen on hydrogen-saturated Pt(111) surfaces may be due to a lesser degree of surface reconstruction, a factor found to be significant in the adsorption on close-packed platinum surfaces. Kinetic data using catalysts made out of dispersed tetrahedral Pt nanoparticles corroborated the selective promotion of the trans-to-cis isomerization on the (111) facets of the metal. Our work provides an example for how catalytic selectivity may be controlled by controlling the shape of the catalytic particles."
1247,Reversible switching between p- and n-type conduction in the semiconductor Ag,2009-01-18,"Semiconductors are key materials in modern electronics and are widely used to build, for instance, transistors in integrated circuits as well as thermoelectric materials for energy conversion, and there is a tremendous interest in the development and improvement of novel materials and technologies to increase the performance of electronic devices and thermoelectrics. Tetramorphic Ag10Te4Br3 is a semiconductor capable of switching its electrical properties by a simple change of temperature. The combination of high silver mobility, a small non-stoichiometry range and an internal redox process in the tellurium substructure causes a thermopower drop of 1,400 μV K−1, in addition to a thermal diffusivity in the range of organic polymers. The capability to reversibly switch semiconducting properties from ionic to electronic conduction in one single compound simply by virtue of temperature enables novel electronic devices such as semiconductor switches."
1248,Polymer chain dynamics and glass transition in athermal polymer/nanoparticle mixtures,2009-01-11,"Polymer nanocomposites (PNCs), prepared by incorporating nanoparticles within a polymer host, generally exhibit properties that differ significantly from those of the host, even with small amounts of nanoparticles. A significant challenge is how to tailor the properties of these materials for applications (structural and biomedical to optoelectronic), because PNCs derive their properties from a collective and complex range of entropic and enthalpic interactions. Here, we show that PNCs, prepared from athermal mixtures of polymer-chain-grafted gold nanoparticles and unentangled polymer chains, may exhibit increases or decreases in their relaxation dynamics, and viscosity, by over an order of magnitude through control of nanoparticle concentration, nanoparticle size, grafting density and grafting chain degree of polymerization. In addition, we show how the glass transition may also be tailored by up to 10∘ with the addition of less than 1.0 wt% nanoparticles to the polymer host."
1249,"Complex and hierarchical micelle architectures from diblock copolymers using living, crystallization-driven polymerizations",2009-01-11,"Block copolymers consist of two or more chemically distinct polymer segments, or blocks, connected by a covalent link. In a selective solvent for one of the blocks, core–corona micelle structures are formed. We demonstrate that living polymerizations driven by the epitaxial crystallization of a core-forming metalloblock represent a synthetic tool that can be used to generate complex and hierarchical micelle architectures from diblock copolymers. The use of platelet micelles as initiators enables the formation of scarf-like architectures in which cylindrical micelle tassels of controlled length are grown from specific crystal faces. A similar process enables the fabrication of brushes of cylindrical micelles on a crystalline homopolymer substrate. Living polymerizations driven by heteroepitaxial growth can also be accomplished and are illustrated by the formation of tri- and pentablock and scarf architectures with cylinder–cylinder and platelet–cylinder connections, respectively, that involve different core-forming metalloblocks."
1250,Infection-mimicking materials to program dendritic cells ,2009-01-11,"Cancer vaccines typically depend on cumbersome and expensive manipulation of cells in the laboratory, and subsequent cell transplantation leads to poor lymph-node homing and limited efficacy. We propose that materials mimicking key aspects of bacterial infection may instead be used to directly control immune-cell trafficking and activation in the body. It is demonstrated that polymers can be designed to first release a cytokine to recruit and house host dendritic cells, and subsequently present cancer antigens and danger signals to activate the resident dendritic cells and markedly enhance their homing to lymph nodes. Specific and protective anti-tumour immunity was generated with these materials, as 90% survival was achieved in animals that otherwise die from cancer within 25 days. These materials show promise as cancer vaccines, and more broadly suggest that polymers may be designed to program and control the trafficking of a variety of cell types in the body."
1251,Spin polarization in half-metals probed by femtosecond spin excitation,2008-12-14,"Knowledge of the spin polarization is of fundamental importance for the use of a material in spintronics applications. Here, we used femtosecond optical excitation of half-metals to distinguish between half-metallic and metallic properties. Because the direct energy transfer by Elliot–Yafet scattering is blocked in a half-metal, the demagnetization time is a measure for the degree of half-metallicity. We propose that this characteristic enables us vice versa to establish a novel and fast characterization tool for this highly important material class used in spin-electronic devices. The technique has been applied to a variety of materials where the spin polarization at the Fermi level ranges from 45 to 98%: Ni, Co2MnSi, Fe3O4, La0.66Sr0.33MnO3 and CrO2."
1252,Regular arrays of highly ordered ferroelectric polymer nanostructures for non-volatile low-voltage memories,2008-12-07,"Ferroelectric nanostructures are attracting tremendous interest because they offer a promising route to novel integrated electronic devices such as non-volatile memories and probe-based mass data storage. Here, we demonstrate that high-density arrays of nanostructures of a ferroelectric polymer can be easily fabricated by a simple nano-embossing protocol, with integration densities larger than 33 Gbits inch−2. The orientation of the polarization axis, about which the dipole moment rotates, is simultaneously aligned in plane over the whole patterned region. Internal structural defects are significantly eliminated in the nanostructures. The improved crystal orientation and quality enable well-defined uniform switching behaviour from cell to cell. Each nanocell shows a narrow and almost ideal square-shaped hysteresis curve, with low energy losses and a coercive field of ∼10 MV m−1, well below previously reported bulk values. These results pave the way to the fabrication of soft plastic memories compatible with all-organic electronics and low-power information technology."
1253,A synergistic assembly of nanoscale lamellar photoconductor hybrids,2008-12-07,"Highly ordered nanostructured organic/inorganic hybrids offer chemical tunability, novel functionalities and enhanced performance over their individual components. Hybrids of complementary p-type organic and n-type inorganic components have attracted interest in optoelectronics, where high-efficiency devices with minimal cost are desired. We demonstrate here self-assembly of a lamellar hybrid containing periodic and alternating 1-nm-thick sheets of polycrystalline ZnO separated by 2–3 nm layers of conjugated molecules, directly onto an electrode. Initially the electrodeposited inorganic is Zn(OH)2, but π–π interactions among conjugated molecules stabilize synergistically the periodic nanostructure as it converts to ZnO at 150 ∘C. As photoconductors, normalized detectivities (D*) greater than 2×1010 Jones, photocurrent gains of 120 at 1.2 V μm−1 and dynamic ranges greater than 60 dB are observed on selective excitation of the organic. These are among the highest values measured for organic, hybrid and amorphous silicon, making them technologically competitive as low-power, wavelength-tunable, flexible and environmentally benign photoconductors."
1254,Thermally stable Pt/mesoporous silica core–shell nanocatalysts for high-temperature reactions,2008-11-23,"Recent advances in colloidal synthesis enabled the precise control of the size, shape and composition of catalytic metal nanoparticles, enabling their use as model catalysts for systematic investigations of the atomic-scale properties affecting catalytic activity and selectivity. The organic capping agents stabilizing colloidal nanoparticles, however, often limit their application in high-temperature catalytic reactions. Here, we report the design of a high-temperature-stable model catalytic system that consists of a Pt metal core coated with a mesoporous silica shell (Pt@mSiO2). Inorganic silica shells encaged the Pt cores up to 750 ∘C in air and the mesopores providing direct access to the Pt core made the Pt@mSiO2 nanoparticles as catalytically active as bare Pt metal for ethylene hydrogenation and CO oxidation. The high thermal stability of Pt@mSiO2 nanoparticles enabled high-temperature CO oxidation studies, including ignition behaviour, which was not possible for bare Pt nanoparticles because of their deformation or aggregation. The results suggest that the Pt@mSiO2 nanoparticles are excellent nanocatalytic systems for high-temperature catalytic reactions or surface chemical processes, and the design concept used in the Pt@mSiO2 core–shell catalyst can be extended to other metal/metal oxide compositions."
1255,Direct measurement of the electronic spin diffusion length in a fully functional organic spin valve by low-energy muon spin rotation,2008-11-23,"Electronic devices that use the spin degree of freedom hold unique prospects for future technology. The performance of these ‘spintronic’ devices relies heavily on the efficient transfer of spin polarization across different layers and interfaces. This complex transfer process depends on individual material properties and also, most importantly, on the structural and electronic properties of the interfaces between the different materials and defects that are common to real devices. Knowledge of these factors is especially important for the relatively new field of organic spintronics, where there is a severe lack of suitable experimental techniques that can yield depth-resolved information about the spin polarization of charge carriers within buried layers of real devices. Here, we present a new depth-resolved technique for measuring the spin polarization of current-injected electrons in an organic spin valve and find the temperature dependence of the measured spin diffusion length is correlated with the device magnetoresistance."
1256,Determination of spin injection and transport in a ferromagnet/organic semiconductor heterojunction by two-photon photoemission,2008-11-23,"A fundamental prerequisite for the implementation of organic semiconductors (OSCs) in spintronics devices is the still missing basic knowledge about spin injection and transport in OSCs. Here, we consider a model system consisting of a high-quality interface between the ferromagnet cobalt and the OSC copper phthalocyanine (CuPc). We focus on interfacial effects on spin injection and on the spin transport properties of CuPc. Using spin-resolved two-photon photoemission, we have measured directly and in situ the efficiency of spin injection at the cobalt–CuPc interface. We report a spin injection efficiency of 85–90% for injection into unoccupied molecular orbitals of CuPc. Moreover, we estimate an electron inelastic mean free path in CuPc in the range of 1 nm and a 10–30 times higher quasi-elastic spin-flip length. We demonstrate that quasi-elastic spin-flip processes with energy loss ⩽200 meV are the dominant microscopic mechanism limiting the spin diffusion length in CuPc."
1257,A map for phase-change materials,2008-11-16,"Phase-change materials are characterized by a unique property portfolio well suited for data storage applications. Here, a first treasure map for phase-change materials is presented on the basis of a fundamental understanding of the bonding characteristics. This map is spanned by two coordinates that can be calculated just from the composition, and represent the degree of ionicity and the tendency towards hybridization (‘covalency’) of the bonding. A small magnitude of both quantities is an inherent characteristic of phase-change materials. This coordinate scheme enables a prediction of trends for the physical properties on changing stoichiometry."
1258,Electronic two-terminal bistable graphitic memories,2008-11-16,"Transistors are the basis for electronic switching and memory devices as they exhibit extreme reliabilities with on/off ratios of 104–105, and billions of these three-terminal devices can be fabricated on single planar substrates. On the other hand, two-terminal devices coupled with a nonlinear current–voltage response can be considered as alternatives provided they have large and reliable on/off ratios and that they can be fabricated on a large scale using conventional or easily accessible methods. Here, we report that two-terminal devices consisting of discontinuous 5–10 nm thin films of graphitic sheets grown by chemical vapour deposition on either nanowires or atop planar silicon oxide exhibit enormous and sharp room-temperature bistable current–voltage behaviour possessing stable, rewritable, non-volatile and non-destructive read memories with on/off ratios of up to 107 and switching times of up to 1 μs (tested limit). A nanoelectromechanical mechanism is proposed for the unusually pronounced switching behaviour in the devices."
1259,From Mott state to superconductivity in 1T-TaS,2008-11-09,"The search for the coexistence between superconductivity and other collective electronic states in many instances promoted the discovery of novel states of matter. The manner in which the different types of electronic order combine remains an ongoing puzzle. 1T-TaS2 is a layered material, and the only transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) known to develop the Mott phase. Here, we show the appearance of a series of low-temperature electronic states in 1T-TaS2 with pressure: the Mott phase melts into a textured charge-density wave (CDW); superconductivity develops within the CDW state, and survives to very high pressures, insensitive to subsequent disappearance of the CDW state and, surprisingly, also the strong changes in the normal state. This is also the first reported case of superconductivity in a pristine 1T-TMD compound. We demonstrate that superconductivity first develops within the state marked by a commensurability-driven, Coulombically frustrated, electronic phase separation."
1260,A metal-free polymeric photocatalyst for hydrogen production from water under visible light,2008-11-09,"The production of hydrogen from water using a catalyst and solar energy is an ideal future energy source, independent of fossil reserves. For an economical use of water and solar energy, catalysts that are sufficiently efficient, stable, inexpensive and capable of harvesting light are required. Here, we show that an abundant material, polymeric carbon nitride, can produce hydrogen from water under visible-light irradiation in the presence of a sacrificial donor. Contrary to other conducting polymer semiconductors, carbon nitride is chemically and thermally stable and does not rely on complicated device manufacturing. The results represent an important first step towards photosynthesis in general where artificial conjugated polymer semiconductors can be used as energy transducers."
1261,Single-molecule nanocatalysis reveals heterogeneous reaction pathways and catalytic dynamics,2008-11-09,"Nanoparticles are important catalysts for many chemical transformations. However, owing to their structural dispersions, heterogeneous distribution of surface sites and surface restructuring dynamics, nanoparticles are intrinsically heterogeneous and challenging to characterize in ensemble measurements. Using a single-nanoparticle single-turnover approach, we study the redox catalysis of individual colloidal Au nanoparticles in solution, using single-molecule detection of fluorogenic reactions. We find that for product generation, all Au nanoparticles follow a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism but with heterogeneous reactivity; and for product dissociation, three nanoparticle subpopulations are present that show heterogeneous reactivity between multiple dissociation pathways with distinct kinetics. Correlation analyses of single-turnover waiting times further reveal activity fluctuations of individual Au nanoparticles, attributable to both catalysis-induced and spontaneous dynamic surface restructuring that occurs at different timescales at the surface catalytic and product docking sites. The results exemplify the power of the single-molecule approach in revealing the interplay of catalysis, heterogeneous reactivity and surface structural dynamics in nanocatalysis."
1262,Accordion-like honeycombs for tissue engineering of cardiac anisotropy,2008-11-02,"Tissue-engineered grafts may be useful in myocardial repair; however, previous scaffolds have been structurally incompatible with recapitulating cardiac anisotropy. Here, we use microfabrication techniques to create an accordion-like honeycomb microstructure in poly(glycerol sebacate), which yields porous, elastomeric three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds with controllable stiffness and anisotropy. Accordion-like honeycomb scaffolds with cultured neonatal rat heart cells demonstrated utility through: (1) closely matched mechanical properties compared to native adult rat right ventricular myocardium, with stiffnesses controlled by polymer curing time; (2) heart cell contractility inducible by electric field stimulation with directionally dependent electrical excitation thresholds (p<0.05); and (3) greater heart cell alignment (p<0.0001) than isotropic control scaffolds. Prototype bilaminar scaffolds with 3D interconnected pore networks yielded electrically excitable grafts with multi-layered neonatal rat heart cells. Accordion-like honeycombs can thus overcome principal structural–mechanical limitations of previous scaffolds, promoting the formation of grafts with aligned heart cells and mechanical properties more closely resembling native myocardium."
1263,Insight into silicate-glass corrosion mechanisms,2008-10-26,"The remarkable chemical durability of silicate glass makes it suitable for a wide range of applications. The slowdown of the aqueous glass corrosion kinetics that is frequently observed at long time is generally attributed to chemical affinity effects (saturation of the solution with respect to silica). Here, we demonstrate a new mechanism and highlight the impact of morphological transformations in the alteration layer on the leaching kinetics. A direct correlation between structure and reactivity is revealed by coupling the results of several structure-sensitive experiments with numerical simulations at mesoscopic scale. The sharp drop in the corrosion rate is shown to arise from densification of the outer layers of the alteration film, leading to pore closure. The presence of insoluble elements in the glass can inhibit the film restructuring responsible for this effect. This mechanism may be more broadly applicable to silicate minerals."
1264,Structural and magnetic phase diagram of CeFeAsO,2008-10-26,"Recently, high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity was discovered in the iron pnictide RFeAsO1−xFx (R, rare-earth metal) family of materials. We use neutron scattering to study the structural and magnetic phase transitions in CeFeAsO1−xFx as the system is tuned from a semimetal to a high-Tc superconductor through fluorine (F) doping, x. In the undoped state, CeFeAsO develops a structural lattice distortion followed by a collinear antiferromagnetic order with decreasing temperature. With increasing fluorine doping, the structural phase transition decreases gradually and vanishes within the superconductivity dome near x=0.10, whereas the antiferromagnetic order is suppressed before the appearance of superconductivity for x>0.06, resulting in an electronic phase diagram remarkably similar to that of the high-Tc copper oxides. Comparison of the structural evolution of CeFeAsO1−xFx with other Fe-based superconductors suggests that the structural perfection of the Fe–As tetrahedron is important for the high-Tc superconductivity in these Fe pnictides."
1265,Hierarchical nanofabrication of microporous crystals with ordered mesoporosity,2008-10-26,"Shaped zeolite nanocrystals and larger zeolite particles with three-dimensionally ordered mesoporous (3DOm) features hold exciting technological implications for manufacturing thin, oriented molecular sieve films and realizing new selective, molecularly accessible and robust catalysts. A recognized means for controlled synthesis of such nanoparticulate and imprinted materials revolves around templating approaches, yet identification of an appropriately versatile template has remained elusive. Because of their highly interconnected pore space, ordered mesoporous carbon replicas serve as conceptually attractive materials for carrying out confined synthesis of zeolite crystals. Here, we demonstrate how a wide range of crystal morphologies can be realized through such confined growth within 3DOm carbon, synthesized by replication of colloidal crystals composed of size-tunable (about 10–40 nm) silica nanoparticles. Confined crystal growth within these templates leads to size-tunable, uniformly shaped silicalite-1 nanocrystals as well as 3DOm-imprinted single-crystal zeolite particles. In addition, novel crystal morphologies, consisting of faceted crystal outgrowths from primary crystalline particles have been discovered, providing new insight into constricted crystal growth mechanisms underlying confined synthesis."
1266,Unexpected power-law stress relaxation of entangled ring polymers,2008-10-26,"After many years of intense research, most aspects of the motion of entangled polymers have been understood. Long linear and branched polymers have a characteristic entanglement plateau and their stress relaxes by chain reptation or branch retraction, respectively. In both mechanisms, the presence of chain ends is essential. But how do entangled polymers without ends relax their stress? Using properly purified high-molar-mass ring polymers, we demonstrate that these materials exhibit self-similar dynamics, yielding a power-law stress relaxation. However, trace amounts of linear chains at a concentration almost two decades below their overlap cause an enhanced mechanical response. An entanglement plateau is recovered at higher concentrations of linear chains. These results constitute an important step towards solving an outstanding problem of polymer science and are useful for manipulating properties of materials ranging from DNA to polycarbonate. They also provide possible directions for tuning the rheology of entangled polymers."
1267,Tunnelling spectra of individual magnetic endofullerene molecules,2008-10-19,"The manipulation of single magnetic molecules may enable new strategies for high-density information storage and quantum-state control. However, progress in these areas depends on developing techniques for addressing individual molecules and controlling their spin. Here, we report success in making electrical contact to individual magnetic N@C60 molecules and measuring spin excitations in their electron tunnelling spectra. We verify that the molecules remain magnetic by observing a transition as a function of magnetic field that changes the spin quantum number and also the existence of non-equilibrium tunnelling originating from low-energy excited states. From the tunnelling spectra, we identify the charge and spin states of the molecule. The measured spectra can be reproduced theoretically by accounting for the exchange interaction between the nitrogen spin and electron(s) on the C60 cage."
1268,Electron and phonon renormalization near charged defects in carbon nanotubes,2008-10-19,"Owing to their influence on electrons and phonons, defects can significantly alter electrical conductance, and optical, mechanical and thermal properties of a material. Thus, understanding and control of defects, including dopants in low-dimensional systems, hold great promise for engineered materials and nanoscale devices. Here, we characterize experimentally the effects of a single defect on electrons and phonons in single-wall carbon nanotubes. The effects demonstrated here are unusual in that they are not caused by defect-induced symmetry breaking. Electrons and phonons are strongly coupled in sp2 carbon systems, and a defect causes renormalization of electron and phonon energies. We find that near a negatively charged defect, the electron velocity is increased, which in turn influences lattice vibrations locally. Combining measurements on nanotube ensembles and on single nanotubes, we capture the relation between atomic response and the readily accessible macroscopic behaviour."
1269,Printable ion-gel gate dielectrics for low-voltage polymer thin-film transistors on plastic,2008-10-19,"An important strategy for realizing flexible electronics is to use solution-processable materials that can be directly printed and integrated into high-performance electronic components on plastic. Although examples of functional inks based on metallic, semiconducting and insulating materials have been developed, enhanced printability and performance is still a challenge. Printable high-capacitance dielectrics that serve as gate insulators in organic thin-film transistors are a particular priority. Solid polymer electrolytes (a salt dissolved in a polymer matrix) have been investigated for this purpose, but they suffer from slow polarization response, limiting transistor speed to less than 100 Hz. Here, we demonstrate that an emerging class of polymer electrolytes known as ion gels can serve as printable, high-capacitance gate insulators in organic thin-film transistors. The specific capacitance exceeds that of conventional ceramic or polymeric gate dielectrics, enabling transistor operation at low voltages with kilohertz switching frequencies."
1270,Ultrahigh stress and strain in hierarchically structured hollow nanoparticles,2008-10-19,"Nanocrystalline materials offer very high strength but are typically limited in their strain to failure, and efforts to improve deformability in these materials are usually found to be at the expense of strength. Using a combination of quantitative in situ compression in a transmission electron microscope and finite-element analysis, we show that the mechanical properties of nanoparticles can be directly measured and interpreted on an individual basis. We find that nanocrystalline CdS synthesized into a spherical shell geometry is capable of withstanding extreme stresses (approaching the ideal shear strength of CdS). This unusual strength enables the spherical shells to exhibit considerable deformation to failure (up to 20% of the sphere’s diameter). By taking into account the structural hierarchy intrinsic to novel nanocrystalline materials such as this, we show it is possible to achieve and characterize the ultrahigh stresses and strains that exist within a single nanoparticle during deformation."
1271,Metal hydrides for lithium-ion batteries,2008-10-12,"Classical electrodes for Li-ion technology operate via an insertion/de-insertion process. Recently, conversion electrodes have shown the capability of greater capacity, but have so far suffered from a marked hysteresis in voltage between charge and discharge, leading to poor energy efficiency and voltages. Here, we present the electrochemical reactivity of MgH2 with Li that constitutes the first use of a metal-hydride electrode for Li-ion batteries. The MgH2 electrode shows a large, reversible capacity of 1,480 mAh g−1 at an average voltage of 0.5 V versus Li+/Li∘ which is suitable for the negative electrode. In addition, it shows the lowest polarization for conversion electrodes. The electrochemical reaction results in formation of a composite containing Mg embedded in a LiH matrix, which on charging converts back to MgH2. Furthermore, the reaction is not specific to MgH2, as other metal or intermetallic hydrides show similar reactivity towards Li. Equally promising, the reaction produces nanosized Mg and MgH2, which show enhanced hydrogen sorption/desorption kinetics. We hope that such findings can pave the way for designing nanoscale active metal elements with applications in hydrogen storage and lithium-ion batteries."
1272,Pressure-dependent structures of amorphous red phosphorus and the origin of the first sharp diffraction peaks,2008-10-12,"Characterizing the nature of medium-range order (MRO) in liquids and disordered solids is important for understanding their structure and transport properties. However, accurately portraying MRO, as manifested by the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) in neutron and X-ray scattering measurements, has remained elusive for more than 80 years. Here, using X-ray diffraction of amorphous red phosphorus compressed to 6.30 GPa, supplemented with micro-Raman scattering studies, we build three-dimensional structural models consistent with the diffraction data. We discover that the pressure dependence of the FSDP intensity and line position can be quantitatively accounted for by a characteristic void distribution function, defined in terms of average void size, void spacing and void density. This work provides a template to unambiguously interpret atomic and void-space MRO across a broad range of technologically promising network-forming materials."
1273,Universal link between the boson peak and transverse phonons in glass,2008-10-12,"The physical properties of a topologically disordered amorphous material (glass), such as heat capacity and thermal conductivity, are markedly different from those of its ordered crystalline counterpart. The understanding of these phenomena is a notoriously complex problem. One of the universal features of disordered glasses is the ‘boson peak’, which is observed in neutron and Raman scattering experiments. The boson peak is typically ascribed to an excess density of vibrational states. Here, we study the nature of the boson peak, using numerical simulations of several glass-forming systems. We discovered evidence suggestive of the equality of the boson peak frequency to the Ioffe–Regel limit for ‘transverse’ phonons, above which transverse phonons no longer propagate. Our results indicate a possibility that the origin of the boson peak is transverse vibrational modes associated with defective soft structures in the disordered state. Furthermore, we suggest a possible link between slow structural relaxation and fast boson peak dynamics in glass-forming systems."
1274,"Ultrathin silicon solar microcells for semitransparent, mechanically flexible and microconcentrator module designs",2008-10-05,"The high natural abundance of silicon, together with its excellent reliability and good efficiency in solar cells, suggest its continued use in production of solar energy, on massive scales, for the foreseeable future. Although organics, nanocrystals, nanowires and other new materials hold significant promise, many opportunities continue to exist for research into unconventional means of exploiting silicon in advanced photovoltaic systems. Here, we describe modules that use large-scale arrays of silicon solar microcells created from bulk wafers and integrated in diverse spatial layouts on foreign substrates by transfer printing. The resulting devices can offer useful features, including high degrees of mechanical flexibility, user-definable transparency and ultrathin-form-factor microconcentrator designs. Detailed studies of the processes for creating and manipulating such microcells, together with theoretical and experimental investigations of the electrical, mechanical and optical characteristics of several types of module that incorporate them, illuminate the key aspects."
1275,Avoided crossing of rattler modes in thermoelectric materials,2008-08-31,"Engineering of materials with specific physical properties has recently focused on the effect of nano-sized ‘guest domains’ in a ‘host matrix’ that enable tuning of electrical, mechanical, photo-optical or thermal properties. A low thermal conductivity is a prerequisite for obtaining effective thermoelectric materials, and the challenge is to limit the conduction of heat by phonons, without simultaneously reducing the charge transport. This is named the ‘phonon glass–electron crystal’ concept and may be realized in host–guest systems. The guest entities are believed to have independent oscillations, so-called rattler modes, which scatter the acoustic phonons and reduce the thermal conductivity. We have investigated the phonon dispersion relation in the phonon glass–electron crystal material Ba8Ga16Ge30 using neutron triple-axis spectroscopy. The results disclose unambiguously the theoretically predicted avoided crossing of the rattler modes and the acoustic-phonon branches. The observed phonon lifetimes are longer than expected, and a new explanation for the low κL is provided."
1276,Breakdown of phonon glass paradigm in La- and Ce-filled Fe,2008-08-31,"The material class of skutterudites is believed to have strong potential for thermoelectric application due to the very low thermal conductivity of the filled structures. It is generally assumed that the atoms filling the skutterudite cages act as ‘rattlers’ and essentially induce a disordered lattice dynamics referred to as ‘phonon glass’. Here, we present neutron spectroscopy experiments and ab initio computational work on phonons in LaFe4Sb12 and CeFe4Sb12. Our results give unequivocal evidence of essentially temperature-independent lattice dynamics with well-defined phase relations between guest and host dynamics, indicative of a quasi-harmonic coupling between the guests and the host lattice. These conclusions are in disagreement with the ‘phonon glass’ paradigm based on individual ‘rattling’ of the guest atoms. These findings should have an essential impact on the design and improvement of thermoelectric materials and on the development of microscopic models needed for these efforts."
1277,Small functional groups for controlled differentiation of hydrogel-encapsulated human mesenchymal stem cells,2008-08-24,"Cell–matrix interactions have critical roles in regeneration, development and disease. The work presented here demonstrates that encapsulated human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) can be induced to differentiate down osteogenic and adipogenic pathways by controlling their three-dimensional environment using tethered small-molecule chemical functional groups. Hydrogels were formed using sufficiently low concentrations of tether molecules to maintain constant physical characteristics, encapsulation of hMSCs in three dimensions prevented changes in cell morphology, and hMSCs were shown to differentiate in normal growth media, indicating that the small-molecule functional groups induced differentiation. To our knowledge, this is the first example where synthetic matrices are shown to control induction of multiple hMSC lineages purely through interactions with small-molecule chemical functional groups tethered to the hydrogel material. Strategies using simple chemistry to control complex biological processes would be particularly powerful as they could make production of therapeutic materials simpler, cheaper and more easily controlled."
1278,Strong magneto-chiral dichroism in enantiopure chiral ferromagnets,2008-08-17,"As materials science is moving towards the synthesis, the study and the processing of new materials exhibiting well-defined and complex functions, the synthesis of new multifunctional materials is one of the important challenges. One of these complex physical properties is magneto-chiral dichroism which arises, at second order, from the coexistence of spatial asymmetry and magnetization in a material. Herein we report the first measurement of strong magneto-chiral dichroism in an enantiopure chiral ferromagnet. The ab initio synthesis of the enantiopure chiral ferromagnet is based on an enantioselective self-assembly, where a resolved chiral quaternary ammonium cation imposes the absolute configurations of the metal centres within chromium–manganese two-dimensional oxalate layers. The ferromagnetic interaction between Cr(III) and Mn(II) ions leads to a Curie temperature of 7 K. The magneto-chiral dichroic effect is enhanced by a factor of 17 when entering into the ferromagnetic phase."
1279,Spin Rabi flopping in the photocurrent of a polymer light-emitting diode,2008-08-17,"Electron spin is fundamental in electrical and optical properties of organic electronic devices. Despite recent interest in spin mixing and spin transport in organic semiconductors, the actual spin coherence times in these materials have remained elusive. Measurements of spin coherence provide impartial insight into spin relaxation mechanisms, which is significant in view of recent models of spin-dependent transport and recombination involving high levels of spin mixing. We demonstrate coherent manipulation of spins in an organic light-emitting diode (OLED), using nanosecond pulsed electrically detected electron spin resonance to drive singlet–triplet spin Rabi oscillations. By measuring the change in photovoltaic response due to spin-dependent recombination, we demonstrate spin control of electronic transport and thus directly observe spin coherence over 0.5 μs. This surprisingly slow spin dephasing underlines that spin mixing is not responsible for magnetoresistance in OLEDs. The long coherence times and the spin manipulation demonstrated are crucially important for expanding the impact of organic spintronics."
1280,Direct fabrication of metavanadate phosphor films on organic substrates for white-light-emitting devices,2008-08-01,"White-light-emitting materials have attracted considerable attention because of their applications, such as large-surface emitting devices. Inorganic phosphor films are expected to be applied to these devices because of good chemical stability; however, a substantial reduction of fabrication temperature is required for future industrial uses such as lighting materials fabricated onto flexible organic substrates. Here we show the optical properties of white-light-emitting metavanadate phosphors, AVO3 (A: K, Rb and Cs), and we report a new direct fabrication process for RbVO3 films onto flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates by means of a vacuum ultraviolet irradiation using an excimer lamp. In addition, the (Ca,Sr,Pr)TiO3/a-Al2O3/RbVO3/PET heterostructure prepared by an excimer-laser-assisted metal–organic deposition process has demonstrated the possibility of colour modification for RbVO3 films on PET. Our findings suggest new possibilities for further development of large-surface emitting lighting devices."
1281,Materials design principles of ancient fish armour,2008-07-27,"Knowledge of the structure–property–function relationships of dermal scales of armoured fish could enable pathways to improved bioinspired human body armour, and may provide clues to the evolutionary origins of mineralized tissues. Here, we present a multiscale experimental and computational approach that reveals the materials design principles present within individual ganoid scales from the ‘living fossil’ Polypterus senegalus. This fish belongs to the ancient family Polypteridae, which first appeared 96 million years ago during the Cretaceous period and still retains many of their characteristics. The mechanistic origins of penetration resistance (approximating a biting attack) were investigated and found to include the juxtaposition of multiple distinct reinforcing composite layers that each undergo their own unique deformation mechanisms, a unique spatial functional form of mechanical properties with regions of differing levels of gradation within and between material layers, and layers with an undetectable gradation, load-dependent effective material properties, circumferential surface cracking, orthogonal microcracking in laminated sublayers and geometrically corrugated junctions between layers."
1282,Room-temperature single-phase Li insertion/extraction in nanoscale Li,2008-07-27,"Classical electrodes for Li-ion technology operate by either single-phase or two-phase Li insertion/de-insertion processes, with single-phase mechanisms presenting some intrinsic advantages with respect to various storage applications. We report the feasibility to drive the well-established two-phase room-temperature insertion process in LiFePO4 electrodes into a single-phase one by modifying the material’s particle size and ion ordering. Electrodes made of LiFePO4 nanoparticles (40 nm) formed by a low-temperature precipitation process exhibit sloping voltage charge/discharge curves, characteristic of a single-phase behaviour. The presence of defects and cation vacancies, as deduced by chemical/physical analytical techniques, is crucial in accounting for our results. Whereas the interdependency of particle size, composition and structure complicate the theorists’ attempts to model phase stability in nanoscale materials, it provides new opportunities for chemists and electrochemists because numerous electrode materials could exhibit a similar behaviour at the nanoscale once their syntheses have been correctly worked out."
1283,Lithium deintercalation in LiFePO,2008-07-20,"Lithium iron phosphate is one of the most promising positive-electrode materials for the next generation of lithium-ion batteries that will be used in electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Lithium deintercalation (intercalation) proceeds through a two-phase reaction between compositions very close to LiFePO4 and FePO4. As both endmember phases are very poor ionic and electronic conductors, it is difficult to understand the intercalation mechanism at the microscopic scale. Here, we report a characterization of electrochemically deintercalated nanomaterials by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy that shows the coexistence of fully intercalated and fully deintercalated individual particles. This result indicates that the growth reaction is considerably faster than its nucleation. The reaction mechanism is described by a ‘domino-cascade model’ and is explained by the existence of structural constraints occurring just at the reaction interface: the minimization of the elastic energy enhances the deintercalation (intercalation) process that occurs as a wave moving through the entire crystal. This model opens new perspectives in the search for new electrode materials even with poor ionic and electronic conductivities."
1284,The role of metal nanoparticles and nanonetworks in alloy degradation,2008-07-11,"Oxide scale, which is essential to protect structural alloys from high-temperature degradation such as oxidation, carburization and metal dusting, is usually considered to consist simply of oxide phases. Here, we report on a nanobeam X-ray and magnetic force microscopy investigation that reveals that the oxide scale actually consists of a mixture of oxide materials and metal nanoparticles. The metal nanoparticles self-assemble into nanonetworks, forming continuous channels for carbon transport through the oxide scales. To avoid the formation of these metallic particles in the oxide scale, alloys must develop a scale without spinel phase. We have designed a novel alloy that has been tested in a high-carbon-activity environment. Our results show that the incubation time for carbon transport through the oxide scale of the new alloy is more than an order of magnitude longer compared with commercial alloys with similar chromium content."
1285,Resonant bonding in crystalline phase-change materials,2008-07-11,"The identification of materials suitable for non-volatile phase-change memory applications is driven by the need to find materials with tailored properties for different technological applications and the desire to understand the scientific basis for their unique properties. Here, we report the observation of a distinctive and characteristic feature of phase-change materials. Measurements of the dielectric function in the energy range from 0.025 to 3 eV reveal that the optical dielectric constant is 70–200% larger for the crystalline than the amorphous phases. This difference is attributed to a significant change in bonding between the two phases. The optical dielectric constant of the amorphous phases is that expected of a covalent semiconductor, whereas that of the crystalline phases is strongly enhanced by resonant bonding effects. The quantification of these is enabled by measurements of the electronic polarizability. As this bonding in the crystalline state is a unique fingerprint for phase-change materials, a simple scheme to identify and characterize potential phase-change materials emerges."
1286,Control of fluidity and miscibility of a binary liquid mixture by the liquid–liquid transition,2008-07-06,"Matter in its liquid state is convenient for processing and controlling chemical reactions, owing to its fluidity. Recently much evidence has been accumulated for the existence of a liquid–liquid transition (LLT) in single-component liquids. Here, we report that we can control, by the LLT of a molecular liquid, triphenyl phosphite (TPP), the fluidity and miscibility of its mixture with another molecular liquid. For a mixture of TPP with toluene or aniline, we find that both liquid I and II mix well and liquid II remains in a ‘liquid’ state, in contrast to pure TPP, where liquid II is a non-ergodic amorphous state. This is the first example of a ‘true’ LLT in a molecular liquid. Furthermore, we find demixing induced by the LLT for a mixture of TPP with diethyl ether or ethanol. These findings will open a new phase of research towards various applications of the LLT."
1287,The true toughness of human cortical bone measured with realistically short cracks,2008-06-29,"Bone is more difficult to break than to split. Although this is well known, and many studies exist on the behaviour of long cracks in bone, there is a need for data on the orientation-dependent crack-growth resistance behaviour of human cortical bone that accurately assesses its toughness at appropriate size scales. Here, we use in situ mechanical testing to examine how physiologically pertinent short (<600 μm) cracks propagate in both the transverse and longitudinal orientations in cortical bone, using both crack-deflection/twist mechanics and nonlinear-elastic fracture mechanics to determine crack-resistance curves. We find that after only 500 μm of cracking, the driving force for crack propagation was more than five times higher in the transverse (breaking) direction than in the longitudinal (splitting) direction owing to major crack deflections/twists, principally at cement sheaths. Indeed, our results show that the true transverse toughness of cortical bone is far higher than previously reported. However, the toughness in the longitudinal orientation, where cracks tend to follow the cement lines, is quite low at these small crack sizes; it is only when cracks become several millimetres in length that bridging mechanisms can fully develop leading to the (larger-crack) toughnesses generally quoted for bone."
1288,Towards non-blinking colloidal quantum dots,2008-06-22,"At a single-molecule level, fluorophore emission intensity fluctuates between bright and dark states. These fluctuations, known as blinking, limit the use of fluorophores in single-molecule experiments. The dark-state duration shows a universal heavy-tailed power-law distribution characterized by the occurrence of long non-emissive periods. Here we have synthesized novel CdSe–CdS core–shell quantum dots with thick crystalline shells, 68% of which do not blink when observed individually at 33 Hz for 5 min. We have established a direct correlation between shell thickness and blinking occurrences. Importantly, the statistics of dark periods that appear at high acquisition rates (1 kHz) are not heavy tailed, in striking contrast with previous observations. Blinking statistics are thus not as universal as thought so far. We anticipate that our results will help to better understand the physico-chemistry of single-fluorophore emission and rationalize the design of other fluorophores that do not blink."
1289,Direct observation of a local structural mechanism for dynamic arrest,2008-06-22,"The mechanism by which a liquid may become arrested, forming a glass or gel, is a long-standing problem of materials science. In particular, long-lived (energetically) locally favoured structures (LFSs), the geometry of which may prevent the system relaxing to its equilibrium state, have long been thought to play a key role in dynamical arrest. Here, we propose a definition of LFSs which we identify with a novel topological method and directly measure with experiments on a colloidal liquid–gel transition. The population of LFSs is a strong function of (effective) temperature in the ergodic liquid phase, rising sharply approaching dynamical arrest, and indeed forms a percolating network that becomes the ‘arms’ of the gel. Owing to the LFSs, the gel is unable to reach equilibrium, crystal–gas coexistence. Our results provide direct experimental observation of a link between local structure and dynamical arrest, and open a new perspective on a wide range of metastable materials."
1290,Guided and fluidic self-assembly of microstructures using railed microfluidic channels,2008-06-15,"Fluidic self-assembly is a promising pathway for parallel fabrication of devices made up of many small components. Here, we introduce ‘railed microfluidics’ as an agile method to guide and assemble microstructures inside fluidic channels. The guided movement of microstructures in microfluidic channels was achieved by fabricating grooves (‘rails’) on the top surface of the channels and also creating complementary polymeric microstructures that fit with the grooves. Using the rails as a guiding mechanism, we built complex one- and two-dimensional microsystems in which all the microstructures initially involved in the fabrication method were incorporated as components in the final product. Complex structures composed of more than 50 microstructures (each sized smaller than 50 μm) were fluidically self-assembled with zero error. Furthermore, we were able to use the rails to guide microstructures through different fluid solutions, successfully overcoming strong interfacial tension between solutions. On the basis of rail-guided self-assembly and cross-solution movement, we demonstrated heterogeneous fluidic self-assembly of polymeric microstructures and living cells. In addition to such assembly of in situ polymerized structures, we also guided and assembled externally fabricated silicon chips—demonstrating the feasible application of railed microfluidics to other materials systems."
1291,Metallic conduction at organic charge-transfer interfaces,2008-06-15,"The electronic properties of interfaces between two different solids can differ strikingly from those of the constituent materials. For instance, metallic conductivity—and even superconductivity—have recently been discovered at interfaces formed by insulating transition-metal oxides. Here, we investigate interfaces between crystals of conjugated organic molecules, which are large-gap undoped semiconductors, that is, essentially insulators. We find that highly conducting interfaces can be realized with resistivity ranging from 1 to 30 kΩ per square, and that, for the best samples, the temperature dependence of the conductivity is metallic. The observed electrical conduction originates from a large transfer of charge between the two crystals that takes place at the interface, on a molecular scale. As the interface assembly process is simple and can be applied to crystals of virtually any conjugated molecule, the conducting interfaces described here represent the first examples of a new class of electronic systems."
1292,Sidewall oxide effects on spin-torque- and magnetic-field-induced reversal characteristics of thin-film nanomagnets,2008-06-08,"The successful operation of spin-based data storage devices depends on thermally stable magnetic bits. At the same time, the data-processing speeds required by today’s technology necessitate ultrafast switching in storage devices. Achieving both thermal stability and fast switching requires controlling the effective damping in magnetic nanoparticles. By carrying out a surface chemical analysis, we show that through exposure to ambient oxygen during processing, a nanomagnet can develop an antiferromagnetic sidewall oxide layer that has detrimental effects, which include a reduction in the thermal stability at room temperature and anomalously high magnetic damping at low temperatures. The in situ deposition of a thin Al metal layer, oxidized to completion in air, greatly reduces or eliminates these problems. This implies that the effective damping and the thermal stability of a nanomagnet can be tuned, leading to a variety of potential applications in spintronic devices such as spin-torque oscillators and patterned media."
1293,Surface-structure-regulated cell-membrane penetration by monolayer-protected nanoparticles,2008-05-25,"Nanoscale objects are typically internalized by cells into membrane-bounded endosomes and fail to access the cytosolic cell machinery. Whereas some biomacromolecules may penetrate or fuse with cell membranes without overt membrane disruption, no synthetic material of comparable size has shown this property yet. Cationic nano-objects pass through cell membranes by generating transient holes, a process associated with cytotoxicity. Studies aimed at generating cell-penetrating nanomaterials have focused on the effect of size, shape and composition. Here, we compare membrane penetration by two nanoparticle ‘isomers’ with similar composition (same hydrophobic content), one coated with subnanometre striations of alternating anionic and hydrophobic groups, and the other coated with the same moieties but in a random distribution. We show that the former particles penetrate the plasma membrane without bilayer disruption, whereas the latter are mostly trapped in endosomes. Our results offer a paradigm for analysing the fundamental problem of cell-membrane-penetrating bio- and macro-molecules."
1294,Interstitial oxide ion conductivity in the layered tetrahedral network melilite structure,2008-05-18,"High-conductivity oxide ion electrolytes are needed to reduce the operating temperature of solid-oxide fuel cells. Oxide mobility in solids is associated with defects. Although anion vacancies are the charge carriers in most cases, excess (interstitial) oxide anions give high conductivities in isolated polyhedral anion structures such as the apatites. The development of new families of interstitial oxide conductors with less restrictive structural constraints requires an understanding of the mechanisms enabling both incorporation and mobility of the excess oxide. Here, we show how the two-dimensionally connected tetrahedral gallium oxide network in the melilite structure La1.54Sr0.46Ga3O7.27 stabilizes oxygen interstitials by local relaxation around them, affording an oxide ion conductivity of 0.02–0.1 S cm−1 over the 600–900 ∘C temperature range. Polyhedral frameworks with central elements exhibiting variable coordination number can have the flexibility needed to accommodate mobile interstitial oxide ions if non-bridging oxides are present to favour cooperative network distortions."
1295,Phase instability induced by polar nanoregions in a relaxor ferroelectric system,2008-05-11,"Relaxor ferroelectrics are a special class of material that exhibit an enormous electromechanical response and are easily polarized with an external field. These properties make them attractive for applications as sensors and actuators. Local clusters of randomly oriented polarization, known as polar nanoregions (PNRs), are specific to relaxor ferroelectrics and play a key role in governing their dielectric properties. Here, we show through neutron inelastic scattering experiments that the PNRs can also significantly affect the structural properties of the relaxor ferroelectric Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3-4.5%PbTiO3 (PZN-4.5%PT). A strong interaction is found between the PNRs and the propagation of acoustic phonons. A comparison between acoustic phonons propagating along different directions reveals a large asymmetry in the lattice dynamics that is induced by the PNRs. We suggest that a phase instability induced by this PNR–phonon interaction may contribute to the ultrahigh piezoelectric response of this and related relaxor ferroelectric materials. Our results naturally explain the emergence of the various observed monoclinic phases in these systems."
1296,Optical gain by a simple photoisomerization process,2008-05-04,"Organic holographic materials are pursued as versatile and cheap data-storage materials. It is generally assumed that under steady-state conditions, only photorefractive holographic media exhibit a non-local response to a light-intensity pattern, which results in an asymmetric two-beam coupling or ‘gain’, where intensity is transferred from one beam to the other as a measure of writing efficiency. Here, we demonstrate non-local holographic recording in a non-photorefractive material. We demonstrate that reversible photoisomerization gratings recorded in a non-photorefractive azo-based material exhibit large optical gain coefficients beyond 1,000 cm−1, even for polarization gratings. The grating characteristics differ markedly from classical photorefractive features, but can be modelled by considering the influence of the Poynting vector on the photoisomerization. The external control of the Poynting vector enables manipulation of the gain coefficient, including its sign (the direction of energy exchange), a novel phenomenon we refer to as ‘gain steering’. A very high sensitivity of about 100 cm2 J−1 was achieved. This high sensitivity, combined with a high spatial resolution, suggests a great technical advantage for applications in image processing and phase conjugation."
1297,Electronic structures of interfacial states formed at polymeric semiconductor heterojunctions,2008-04-27,"Heterojunctions between organic semiconductors are central to the operation of light-emitting and photovoltaic diodes, providing respectively for electron–hole capture and separation. However, relatively little is known about the character of electronic excitations stable at the heterojunction. We have developed molecular models to study such interfacial excited electronic excitations that form at the heterojunction between model polymer donor and polymer acceptor systems: poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-bis-N,N-(4-butylphenyl)-bis-N,N-phenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine) (PFB) with poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT), and poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-N-(4-butylphenyl)diphenylamine) (TFB) with F8BT. We find that for stable ground-state geometries the excited state has a strong charge-transfer character. Furthermore, when partly covalent, modelled radiative lifetimes (∼10−7 s) and off-chain axis polarization (30∘) match observed ‘exciplex’ emission. Additionally for the PFB:F8BT blend, geometries with fully ionic character are also found, thus accounting for the low electroluminescence efficiency of this system."
1298,Electric-field control of local ferromagnetism using a magnetoelectric multiferroic,2008-04-27,"Multiferroics are of interest for memory and logic device applications, as the coupling between ferroelectric and magnetic properties enables the dynamic interaction between these order parameters. Here, we report an approach to control and switch local ferromagnetism with an electric field using multiferroics. We use two types of electromagnetic coupling phenomenon that are manifested in heterostructures consisting of a ferromagnet in intimate contact with the multiferroic BiFeO3. The first is an internal, magnetoelectric coupling between antiferromagnetism and ferroelectricity in the BiFeO3 film that leads to electric-field control of the antiferromagnetic order. The second is based on exchange interactions at the interface between a ferromagnet (Co0.9Fe0.1) and the antiferromagnet. We have discovered a one-to-one mapping of the ferroelectric and ferromagnetic domains, mediated by the colinear coupling between the magnetization in the ferromagnet and the projection of the antiferromagnetic order in the multiferroic. Our preliminary experiments reveal the possibility to locally control ferromagnetism with an electric field."
1299,A sensitivity-enhanced field-effect chiral sensor,2008-04-20,"Organic thin-film transistor sensors have been recently attracting the attention of the plastic electronics community for their potential exploitation in novel sensing platforms. Specificity and sensitivity are however still open issues: in this respect chiral discrimination—being a scientific and technological achievement in itself—is indeed one of the most challenging sensor bench-tests. So far, conducting-polymer solid-state chiral detection has been carried out at part-per-thousand concentration levels. Here, a novel chiral bilayer organic thin-film transistor gas sensor—comprising an outermost layer with built-in enantioselective properties—is demonstrated to show field-effect amplified sensitivity that enables differential detection of optical isomers in the tens-of-parts-per-million concentration range. The ad-hoc-designed organic semiconductor endowed with chiral side groups, the bilayer structure and the thin-film transistor transducer provide a significant step forward in the development of a high-performance and versatile sensing platform compatible with flexible organic electronic technologies."
1300,Epitaxial graphene on ruthenium,2008-04-06,"Graphene has been used to explore the fascinating electronic properties of ideal two-dimensional carbon, and shows great promise for quantum device architectures. The primary method for isolating graphene, micromechanical cleavage of graphite, is difficult to scale up for applications. Epitaxial growth is an attractive alternative, but achieving large graphene domains with uniform thickness remains a challenge, and substrate bonding may strongly affect the electronic properties of epitaxial graphene layers. Here, we show that epitaxy on Ru(0001) produces arrays of macroscopic single-crystalline graphene domains in a controlled, layer-by-layer fashion. Whereas the first graphene layer indeed interacts strongly with the metal substrate, the second layer is almost completely detached, shows weak electronic coupling to the metal, and hence retains the inherent electronic structure of graphene. Our findings demonstrate a route towards rational graphene synthesis on transition-metal templates for applications in electronics, sensing or catalysis."
1301,A chemically driven insulator–metal transition in non-stoichiometric and amorphous gallium oxide,2008-04-06,"Insulator–metal transitions are well known in transition-metal oxides, but inducing an insulator–metal transition in the oxide of a main group element is a major challenge. Here, we report the observation of an insulator–metal transition, with a conductivity jump of seven orders of magnitude, in highly non-stoichiometric, amorphous gallium oxide of approximate composition GaO1.2 at a temperature around 670 K. We demonstrate through experimental studies and density-functional-theory calculations that the conductivity jump takes place at a critical gallium concentration and is induced by crystallization of stoichiometric Ga2O3 within the metastable oxide matrix—in chemical terms by a disproportionation. This novel mechanism—an insulator–metal transition driven by a heterogeneous solid-state reaction—opens up a new route to achieve metallic behaviour in oxides that are expected to exist only as classic insulators."
1302,Tearing as a test for mechanical characterization of thin adhesive films,2008-03-30,"Thin adhesive films have become increasingly important in applications involving packaging, coating or for advertising. Once a film is adhered to a substrate, flaps can be detached by tearing and peeling, but they narrow and collapse in pointy shapes. Similar geometries are observed when peeling ultrathin films grown or deposited on a solid substrate, or skinning the natural protective cover of a ripe fruit. Here, we show that the detached flaps have perfect triangular shapes with a well-defined vertex angle; this is a signature of the conversion of bending energy into surface energy of fracture and adhesion. In particular, this triangular shape of the tear encodes the mechanical parameters related to these three forms of energy and could form the basis of a quantitative assay for the mechanical characterization of thin adhesive films, nanofilms deposited on substrates or fruit skin."
1303,Electrostatic electrochemistry at insulators,2008-03-23,"The identity of charges generated by contact electrification on dielectrics has remained unknown for centuries and the precise determination of the charge density is also a long-standing challenge. Here, electrostatic charges on Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene) produced by rubbing with Lucite (polymethylmethacrylate) were directly identified as electrons rather than ions by electrochemical (redox) experiments with charged Teflon used as a single electrode in solution causing various chemical reactions: pH increases; hydrogen formation; metal deposition; Fe(CN)63− reduction; and chemiluminescence in the system of Teflon(-)/Ru(bpy)32+/S2O82− (analogous to electrogenerated chemiluminescence). Moreover, copper deposition could be amplified by depositing Pd first in a predetermined pattern, followed by electroless deposition to produce Cu lines. This process could be potentially important for microelectronic and other applications because Teflon has desirable properties including a low dielectric constant and good thermal stability. Charge density was determined using Faraday’s law and the significance of electron transfer processes on charged polymers and potentially other insulators have been demonstrated."
1304,Microscopic origin of the fast crystallization ability of Ge–Sb–Te phase-change memory materials,2008-03-23,"Ge–Sb–Te materials are used in optical DVDs and non-volatile electronic memories (phase-change random-access memory). In both, data storage is effected by fast, reversible phase changes between crystalline and amorphous states. Despite much experimental and theoretical effort to understand the phase-change mechanism, the detailed atomistic changes involved are still unknown. Here, we describe for the first time how the entire write/erase cycle for the Ge2Sb2Te5 composition can be reproduced using ab initio molecular-dynamics simulations. Deep insight is gained into the phase-change process; very high densities of connected square rings, characteristic of the metastable rocksalt structure, form during melt cooling and are also quenched into the amorphous phase. Their presence strongly facilitates the homogeneous crystal nucleation of Ge2Sb2Te5. As this simulation procedure is general, the microscopic insight provided on crystal nucleation should open up new ways to develop superior phase-change memory materials, for example, faster nucleation, different compositions, doping levels and so on."
1305,Ru–Pt core–shell nanoparticles for preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen,2008-03-16,"Most of the world’s hydrogen supply is currently obtained by reforming hydrocarbons. ‘Reformate’ hydrogen contains significant quantities of CO that poison current hydrogen fuel-cell devices. Catalysts are needed to remove CO from hydrogen through selective oxidation. Here, we report first-principles-guided synthesis of a nanoparticle catalyst comprising a Ru core covered with an approximately 1–2-monolayer-thick shell of Pt atoms. The distinct catalytic properties of these well-characterized core–shell nanoparticles were demonstrated for preferential CO oxidation in hydrogen feeds and subsequent hydrogen light-off. For H2 streams containing 1,000 p.p.m. CO, H2 light-off is complete by 30 ∘C, which is significantly better than for traditional PtRu nano-alloys (85 ∘C), monometallic mixtures of nanoparticles (93 ∘C) and pure Pt particles (170 ∘C). Density functional theory studies suggest that the enhanced catalytic activity for the core–shell nanoparticle originates from a combination of an increased availability of CO-free Pt surface sites on the Ru@Pt nanoparticles and a hydrogen-mediated low-temperature CO oxidation process that is clearly distinct from the traditional bifunctional CO oxidation mechanism."
1306,Coordination-dependent surface atomic contraction in nanocrystals revealed by coherent diffraction,2008-03-09,"Surface atoms have fewer interatomic bonds than those in the bulk that they often relax and reconstruct on extended two-dimensional surfaces. Far less is known about the surface structures of nanocrystals. Here, we show that coherent diffraction patterns recorded from individual nanocrystals are very sensitive to the atomic structure of nanocrystal surfaces. Nanocrystals of Au of 3–5 nm in diameter were studied by examining diffraction intensity oscillations around the Bragg peaks. Both results obtained from modelling the experimental data and molecular dynamics simulations strongly suggest inhomogeneous relaxations, involving large out-of-plane bond length contractions for the edge atoms (∼0.2 Å); a significant contraction (∼0.13 Å) for {100} surface atoms; and a much smaller contraction (∼0.05 Å) for atoms in the middle of the {111} facets. These results denote a coordination/facet dependence that markedly differentiates the structural dynamics of nanocrystals from bulk crystalline surfaces."
1307,Strain control and spontaneous phase ordering in vertical nanocomposite heteroepitaxial thin films,2008-03-02,"Two-phase, vertical nanocomposite heteroepitaxial films hold great promise for (multi)functional device applications. In order to achieve practical devices, a number of hurdles need to be overcome, including the creation of ordered structures (and their formation on a large scale), achieving different combinations of materials and control of strain coupling between the phases. Here we demonstrate major advances on all these fronts: remarkable spontaneously ordered structures were produced in newly predicted compositions, vertical strain was proven to dominate the strain state in films above 20 nm thickness and strain manipulation was demonstrated by selection of phases with the appropriate elastic moduli. The work opens up a new avenue for strain control in relatively thick films and also promises new forms of ordered nanostructures for multifunctional applications."
1308,Field-effect-modulated Seebeck coefficient in organic semiconductors,2008-02-24,"Central to the operation of organic electronic and optoelectronic devices is the transport of charge and energy in the organic semiconductor, and to understand the nature and dynamics of charge carriers is at the focus of intense research efforts. As a basic transport property of solids, the Seebeck coefficient S provides deep insight as it is given by the entropy transported by thermally excited charge carriers and involves in the simplest case only electronic contributions where the transported entropy is determined by details of the band structure and scattering events. We have succeeded for the first time to measure the temperature- and carrier-density-dependent thermopower in single crystals and thin films of two prototypical organic semiconductors by a controlled modulation of the chemical potential in a field-effect geometry. Surprisingly, we find the Seebeck coefficient to be well within the range of the electronic contribution in conventional inorganic semiconductors, highlighting the similarity of transport mechanisms in organic and inorganic semiconductors. Charge and entropy transport is best described as band-like transport of quasiparticles that are subjected to scattering, with exponentially distributed in-gap trap states, and without further contributions to S."
1309,Zero-field optical manipulation of magnetic ions in semiconductors,2008-02-17,"Controlling and monitoring individual spins is desirable for building spin-based devices, as well as implementing quantum information processing schemes. As with trapped ions in cold gases, magnetic ions trapped on a semiconductor lattice have uniform properties and relatively long spin lifetimes. Furthermore, diluted magnetic moments in semiconductors can be strongly coupled to the surrounding host, permitting optical or electrical spin manipulation. Here we describe the zero-field optical manipulation of a few hundred manganese ions in a single gallium arsenide quantum well. Optically created mobile electron spins dynamically generate an energy splitting of the ion spins and enable magnetic moment orientation solely by changing either photon helicity or energy. These polarized manganese spins precess in a transverse field, enabling measurements of the spin lifetimes. As the magnetic ion concentration is reduced and the manganese spin lifetime increases, coherent optical control and readout of single manganese spins in gallium arsenide should be possible."
1310,Wrap–bake–peel process for nanostructural transformation from β-FeOOH nanorods to biocompatible iron oxide nanocapsules,2008-02-17,"The thermal treatment of nanostructured materials to improve their properties generally results in undesirable aggregation and sintering. Here, we report on a novel wrap–bake–peel process, which involves silica coating, heat treatment and finally the removal of the silica layer, to transform the phases and structures of nanostructured materials while preserving their nanostructural characteristics. We demonstrate, as a proof-of-concept, the fabrication of water-dispersible and biocompatible hollow iron oxide nanocapsules by applying this wrap–bake–peel process to spindle-shaped akagenite (β-FeOOH) nanoparticles. Depending on the heat treatment conditions, hollow nanocapsules of either haematite or magnetite were produced. The synthesized water-dispersible magnetite nanocapsules were successfully used not only as a drug-delivery vehicle, but also as a T2 magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent. The current process is generally applicable, and was used to transform heterostructured FePt nanoparticles to high-temperature face-centred-tetragonal-phase FePt alloy nanocrystals."
1311,Contact-induced crystallinity for high-performance soluble acene-based transistors and circuits,2008-02-17,"The use of organic materials presents a tremendous opportunity to significantly impact the functionality and pervasiveness of large-area electronics. Commercialization of this technology requires reduction in manufacturing costs by exploiting inexpensive low-temperature deposition and patterning techniques, which typically lead to lower device performance. We report a low-cost approach to control the microstructure of solution-cast acene-based organic thin films through modification of interfacial chemistry. Chemically and selectively tailoring the source/drain contact interface is a novel route to initiating the crystallization of soluble organic semiconductors, leading to the growth on opposing contacts of crystalline films that extend into the transistor channel. This selective crystallization enables us to fabricate high-performance organic thin-film transistors and circuits, and to deterministically study the influence of the microstructure on the device characteristics. By connecting device fabrication to molecular design, we demonstrate that rapid film processing under ambient room conditions and high performance are not mutually exclusive."
1312,Orientation-dependent ionization energies and interface dipoles in ordered molecular assemblies,2008-02-10,"Although an isolated individual molecule clearly has only one ionization potential, multiple values are found for molecules in ordered assemblies. Photoelectron spectroscopy of archetypical π-conjugated organic compounds on metal substrates combined with first-principles calculations and electrostatic modelling reveal the existence of a surface dipole built into molecular layers. Conceptually different from the surface dipole at metal surfaces, its origin lies in details of the molecular electronic structure and its magnitude depends on the orientation of molecules relative to the surface of an ordered assembly. Suitable pre-patterning of substrates to induce specific molecular orientations in subsequently grown films thus permits adjusting the ionization potential of one molecular species over up to 0.6 eV via control over monolayer morphology. In addition to providing in-depth understanding of this phenomenon, our study offers design guidelines for improved organic–organic heterojunctions, hole- or electron-blocking layers and reduced barriers for charge-carrier injection in organic electronic devices."
1313,Direct imaging of the spatial and energy distribution of nucleation centres in ferroelectric materials,2008-02-03,"Macroscopic ferroelectric polarization switching, similar to other first-order phase transitions, is controlled by nucleation centres. Despite 50 years of extensive theoretical and experimental effort, the microstructural origins of the Landauer paradox, that is, the experimentally observed low values of coercive fields in ferroelectrics corresponding to implausibly large nucleation activation energies, are still a mystery. Here, we develop an approach to visualize the nucleation centres controlling polarization switching processes with nanometre resolution, determine their spatial and energy distribution and correlate them to local microstructure. The random-bond and random-field components of the disorder potential are extracted from positive and negative nucleation biases. Observation of enhanced nucleation activity at the 90∘ domain wall boundaries and intersections combined with phase-field modelling identifies them as a class of nucleation centres that control switching in structural-defect-free materials."
1314,Collapse of magnetic moment drives the Mott transition in MnO,2008-02-03,"The metal–insulator transition in correlated electron systems, where electron states transform from itinerant to localized, has been one of the central themes of condensed-matter physics for more than half a century. The persistence of this question has been a consequence both of the intricacy of the fundamental issues and the growing recognition of the complexities that arise in real materials, when strong repulsive interactions play the primary role. The initial concept of Mott was based on the relative importance of kinetic hopping (measured by the bandwidth) and onsite repulsion of electrons. Real materials, however, have many further degrees of freedom that, as is recently attracting note, give rise to a rich variety of scenarios for a ‘Mott transition’. Here, we report results for the classic correlated insulator MnO that reproduce a simultaneous moment collapse, volume collapse and metallization transition near the observed pressure, and identify the mechanism as collapse of the magnetic moment due to an increase of crystal-field splitting, rather than to variation in the bandwidth."
1315,Biofunctional polymer nanoparticles for intra-articular targeting and retention in cartilage,2008-02-03,"The extracellular matrix of dense, avascular tissues presents a barrier to entry for polymer-based therapeutics, such as drugs encapsulated within polymeric particles. Here, we present an approach by which polymer nanoparticles, sufficiently small to enter the matrix of the targeted tissue, here articular cartilage, are further modified with a biomolecular ligand for matrix binding. This combination of ultrasmall size and biomolecular binding converts the matrix from a barrier into a reservoir, resisting rapid release of the nanoparticles and clearance from the tissue site. Phage display of a peptide library was used to discover appropriate targeting ligands by biopanning on denuded cartilage. The ligand WYRGRL was selected in 94 of 96 clones sequenced after five rounds of biopanning and was demonstrated to bind to collagen II α1. Peptide-functionalized nanoparticles targeted articular cartilage up to 72-fold more than nanoparticles displaying a scrambled peptide sequence following intra-articular injection in the mouse."
1316,Direct access to thermally stable and highly crystalline mesoporous transition-metal oxides with uniform pores,2008-01-27,"Even after a decade or so of research, the direct synthesis of highly crystalline mesoporous transition-metal oxides that are thermally stable and well ordered still constitutes a major challenge. Although various soft- and hard-templating approaches have been developed in the past, they usually suffer from multiple, tedious steps and often result in poor structure control. For many applications including power generation and energy conversion, however, high crystallinity and controlled mesoporosity are a prerequisite. To this end, here we report on an approach established for group-IV (titanium) and group-V (niobium) oxides, with potential applications to photovoltaic cells and fuel cells, respectively, which overcomes previous limitations. It gives direct access to the desired materials in a ‘one-pot’ synthesis using block copolymers with an sp2-hybridized carbon-containing hydrophobic block as structure-directing agents which converts to a sturdy, amorphous carbon material under appropriate heating conditions. This in situ carbon is sufficient to act as a rigid support keeping the pores of the oxides intact while crystallizing at temperatures as high as 1,000 ∘C."
1317,Silver-nanoparticle-embedded antimicrobial paints based on vegetable oil,2008-01-20,"Developing bactericidal coatings using simple green chemical methods could be a promising route to potential environmentally friendly applications. Here, we describe an environmentally friendly chemistry approach to synthesize metal-nanoparticle (MNP)-embedded paint, in a single step, from common household paint. The naturally occurring oxidative drying process in oils, involving free-radical exchange, was used as the fundamental mechanism for reducing metal salts and dispersing MNPs in the oil media, without the use of any external reducing or stabilizing agents. These well-dispersed MNP-in-oil dispersions can be used directly, akin to commercially available paints, on nearly all kinds of surface such as wood, glass, steel and different polymers. The surfaces coated with silver-nanoparticle paint showed excellent antimicrobial properties by killing both Gram-positive human pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli). The process we have developed here is quite general and can be applied in the synthesis of a variety of MNP-in-oil systems."
1318,Morphology evolution via self-organization and lateral and vertical diffusion in polymer:fullerene solar cell blends,2008-01-20,"Control of blend morphology at the microscopic scale is critical for optimizing the power conversion efficiency of plastic solar cells based on blends of conjugated polymer with fullerene derivatives. In the case of bulk heterojunctions of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and a soluble fullerene derivative ([6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester, PCBM), both blend morphology and photovoltaic device performance are influenced by various treatments, including choice of solvent, rate of drying, thermal annealing and vapour annealing. Although the protocols differ significantly, the maximum power conversion efficiency values reported for the various techniques are comparable (4–5%). In this paper, we demonstrate that these techniques all lead to a common arrangement of the components, which consists of a vertically and laterally phase-separated blend of crystalline P3HT and PCBM. We propose a morphology evolution that consists of an initial crystallization of P3HT chains, followed by diffusion of PCBM molecules to nucleation sites, at which aggregates of PCBM then grow."
1319,Mechanical gas capture and release in a network solid via multiple single-crystalline transformations,2008-01-20,"Metal–organic frameworks have demonstrated functionality stemming from both robustness and pliancy and as such, offer promise for a broad range of new materials. The flexible aspect of some of these solids is intriguing for so-called ‘smart’ materials in that they could structurally respond to an external stimulus. Herein, we present an open-channel metal–organic framework that, on dehydration, shifts structure to form closed pores in the solid. This occurs through multiple single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformations such that snapshots of the mechanism of solid-state conversion can be obtained. Notably, the gas composing the atmosphere during dehydration becomes trapped in the closed pores. On rehydration, the pores open to release the trapped gas. Thus, this new material represents a thermally robust and porous material that is also capable of dynamically capturing and releasing gas in a controlled manner."
1320,Atomic-scale study of electric dipoles near charged and uncharged domain walls in ferroelectric films,2007-12-09,"Ferroelectrics are materials exhibiting spontaneous electric polarization due to dipoles formed by displacements of charged ions inside the crystal unit cell. Their exceptional properties are exploited in a variety of microelectronic applications. As ferroelectricity is strongly influenced by surfaces, interfaces and domain boundaries, there is great interest in exploring how the local atomic structure affects the electric properties. Here, using the negative spherical-aberration imaging technique in an aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope, we investigate the cation–oxygen dipoles near 180∘ domain walls in epitaxial PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films on the atomic scale. The width and dipole distortion across a transversal wall and a longitudinal wall are measured, and on this basis the local polarization is calculated. For the first time, a large difference in atomic details between charged and uncharged domain walls is reported."
1321,Parallel cylindrical water nanochannels in Nafion fuel-cell membranes,2007-12-09,"The structure of the Nafion ionomer used in proton-exchange membranes of H2/O2 fuel cells has long been contentious. Using a recently introduced algorithm, we have quantitatively simulated previously published small-angle scattering data of hydrated Nafion. The characteristic ‘ionomer peak’ arises from long parallel but otherwise randomly packed water channels surrounded by partially hydrophilic side branches, forming inverted-micelle cylinders. At 20 vol% water, the water channels have diameters of between 1.8 and 3.5 nm, with an average of 2.4 nm. Nafion crystallites (∼10 vol%), which form physical crosslinks that are crucial for the mechanical properties of Nafion films, are elongated and parallel to the water channels, with cross-sections of ∼(5 nm)2. Simulations for various other models of Nafion, including Gierke’s cluster and the polymer-bundle model, do not match the scattering data. The new model can explain important features of Nafion, including fast diffusion of water and protons through Nafion and its persistence at low temperatures."
1322,Gate-induced insulating state in bilayer graphene devices,2007-12-02,"The potential of graphene-based materials consisting of one or a few layers of graphite for integrated electronics originates from the large room-temperature carrier mobility in these systems (∼10,000 cm2 V−1 s−1). However, the realization of electronic devices such as field-effect transistors will require controlling and even switching off the electrical conductivity by means of gate electrodes, which is made difficult by the absence of a bandgap in the intrinsic material. Here, we demonstrate the controlled induction of an insulating state—with large suppression of the conductivity—in bilayer graphene, by using a double-gate device configuration that enables an electric field to be applied perpendicular to the plane. The dependence of the resistance on temperature and electric field, and the absence of any effect in a single-layer device, strongly suggest that the gate-induced insulating state originates from the recently predicted opening of a bandgap between valence and conduction bands."
1323,Electronic structure of single DNA molecules resolved by transverse scanning tunnelling spectroscopy,2007-11-25,"Attempts to resolve the energy-level structure of single DNA molecules by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy span over the past two decades, owing to the unique ability of this technique to probe the local density of states of objects deposited on a surface. Nevertheless, success was hindered by extreme technical difficulties in stable deposition and reproducibility. Here, by using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy at cryogenic temperature, we disclose the energy spectrum of poly(G)–poly(C) DNA molecules deposited on gold. The tunnelling current–voltage (I–V) characteristics and their derivative (dI/dV–V) curves at 78 K exhibit a clear gap and a peak structure around the gap. Limited fluctuations in the I–V curves are observed and statistically characterized. By means of ab initio density functional theory calculations, the character of the observed peaks is generally assigned to groups of orbitals originating from the different molecular components, namely the nucleobases, the backbone and the counterions."
1324,Surface effects on the orbital order in the single-layered manganite La,2007-11-18,"The question of how bulk electronic order is terminated at a surface is an intriguing one, and one with possible practical implications—for example in nanoscaled systems that may be characterized by their surface behaviour. One example of such order is orbital order, and in principle it should be possible to probe the termination of this order with surface X-ray scattering. Here, we report the first observation of the scattering arising from the termination of bulk orbital order at the surface of a crystal—so-called ‘orbital truncation rods’. The measurements, carried out on a cleaved perovskite, La0.5Sr1.5MnO4, reveal that whereas the crystallographic surface is atomically smooth, the orbital ‘surface’, which is observed through the atomic displacements caused by the orbital order, is much rougher, with a typical scale of the surface roughness of ∼7 Å. Interestingly, the temperature dependence of this scattering shows evidence of a surface-induced second-order transition."
1325,Electronic functionalization of the surface of organic semiconductors with self-assembled monolayers,2007-11-18,"Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are widely used in a variety of emerging applications for surface modification of metals and oxides. Here, we demonstrate a new type of molecular self-assembly: the growth of organosilane SAMs at the surface of organic semiconductors. Remarkably, SAM growth results in a pronounced increase of the surface conductivity of organic materials, which can be very large for SAMs with a strong electron-withdrawing ability. For example, the conductivity induced by perfluorinated alkyl silanes in organic molecular crystals approaches 10−5 S per square, two orders of magnitude greater than the maximum conductivity typically achieved in organic field-effect transistors. The observed large electronic effect opens new opportunities for nanoscale surface functionalization of organic semiconductors with molecular self-assembly. In particular, SAM-induced conductivity shows sensitivity to different molecular species present in the environment, which makes this system very attractive for chemical sensing applications."
1326,Controlled nanoscale doping of semiconductors via molecular monolayers,2007-11-11,"One of the major challenges towards scaling electronic devices to the nanometre-size regime is attaining controlled doping of semiconductor materials with atomic accuracy, as at such small scales, the various existing technologies suffer from a number of setbacks. Here, we present a novel strategy for controlled, nanoscale doping of semiconductor materials by taking advantage of the crystalline nature of silicon and its rich, self-limiting surface reaction properties. Our method relies on the formation of a highly uniform and covalently bonded monolayer of dopant-containing molecules, which enables deterministic positioning of dopant atoms on the Si surfaces. In a subsequent annealing step, the dopant atoms are diffused into the Si lattice to attain the desired doping profile. We show the versatility of our approach through controlled p- and n-doping of a wide range of semiconductor materials, including ultrathin silicon-on-insulator substrates and nanowires, which are then configured into novel transistor structures."
1327,Asymmetric superstructure formed in a block copolymer via phase separation,2007-11-04,"Self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers into well-ordered structures has attracted significant interest over the past decade. An especially attractive application of block-copolymer self-assembly is the formation of isoporous membranes. A major problem in this process is the lack of sufficient long-range order and the difficulty of up-scaling due to the time-consuming preparation steps. Here, we report an innovative and simple method to prepare isoporous membranes with nanometre-sized pores. The combination of the industrially well-established membrane formation method by non-solvent-induced phase separation with the self-assembly of a block copolymer is demonstrated. The result is the creation of an integral asymmetric membrane of a block copolymer with a highly ordered thin layer on top of a non-ordered sponge-like layer. This straightforward and very fast one-step procedure for membrane formation is reported for the first time. The developed membrane has the potential for highly selective separation."
1328,Lattice dynamics of the Zn–Mg–Sc icosahedral quasicrystal and its Zn–Sc periodic 1/1 approximant,2007-11-04,"Quasicrystals are long-range-ordered materials that lack translational invariance, so the study of their physical properties remains a challenging problem. Here, we have carried out inelastic-X-ray- and neutron-scattering experiments on single-grain samples of the Zn–Mg–Sc icosahedral quasicrystal and of the Zn–Sc periodic cubic 1/1 approximant, with the aim of studying the respective influence of the local order and of the long-range order (periodic or quasiperiodic) on lattice dynamics. Besides the overall similarities and the existence of a pseudo-gap in the transverse dispersion relation, marked differences are observed, the pseudo-gap being larger and better defined in the approximant than in the quasicrystal. This can be qualitatively explained using the concept of a pseudo-Brillouin-zone in the quasicrystal. These results are compared with simulations on atomic models and using oscillating pair potentials, and the simulations reproduce in detail the experimental results. This paves the way for a detailed understanding of the physics of quasicrystals."
1329,Tuning magnetoresistance between positive and negative values in organic semiconductors,2007-10-21,"Magnetic-field-dependent injection current, namely magnetoresistance, is readily observable in organic semiconductor devices. This provides a non-contact approach to tune organic optoelectronic properties by using a magnetic field. Here, we demonstrate that this magnetoresistance can be changed between positive and negative values by adjusting the dissociation and charge reaction in excited states through changing the bipolar charge injection in organic light-emitting diodes. This finding reveals that the magnetic-field-dependent generation of secondary charge carriers from the dissociation and charge reaction affects the injection current by forming further space charges at the organic–electrode interfaces and therefore accounts for the tunable magnetoresistance. Furthermore, the dissociation and charge reaction have opposite dependences on magnetic field in the generation of secondary charge carriers, consequently leading to negative and positive magnetoresistance, respectively. As a result, adjusting the dissociation and charge reaction in excited states provides a convenient pathway to tune the magnetoresistance in organic semiconductors."
1330,Rate dependence of crack-tip processes predicts twinning trends in f.c.c. metals,2007-10-14,"Crack-tip behaviour in metals is among the most basic problems in mechanics of materials. Yet, long-standing experimental evidence suggests that crack-tip twinning in face-centred-cubic (f.c.c.) metals is highly dependent on the material, temperature and loading rate, and previous simulations and models predict twinning in aluminium, where it has never been observed. Here, this discrepancy between theory and experiment is resolved through a new model guided and validated by extensive multiscale simulations. Both the analytic model and simulations reveal a transition from crack-tip twinning at short times to full dislocation formation at long times. Applied to a host of f.c.c. metals, the model agrees with experimental trends as it predicts large differences in the thermal activation needed for full dislocation emission to dominate. More broadly, this work demonstrates the necessity of multiscale modelling and attention to rate dependence for accurate description of material behaviour and computationally guided material design."
1331,Direct measurement of the electric-field distribution in a light-emitting electrochemical cell,2007-09-30,"The interplay between ionic and electronic charge carriers in mixed conductors offers rich physics and unique device potential. In light-emitting electrochemical cells (LEECs), for example, the redistribution of ions assists the injection of electronic carriers and leads to efficient light emission. The mechanism of operation of LEECs has been controversial, as there is no consensus regarding the distribution of electric field in these devices. Here, we probe the operation of LEECs using electric force microscopy on planar devices. We show that obtaining the appropriate boundary conditions is essential for capturing the underlying device physics. A patterning scheme that avoids overlap between the mixed-conductor layer and the metal electrodes enabled the accurate in situ measurement of the electric-field distribution. The results show that accumulation and depletion of mobile ions near the electrodes create high interfacial electric fields that enhance the injection of electronic carriers."
1332,Microfluidic scaffolds for tissue engineering,2007-09-30,"Most methods to culture cells in three dimensions depend on a cell-seedable biomaterial to define the global structure of the culture and the microenvironment of the cells. Efforts to tailor these scaffolds have focused on the chemical and mechanical properties of the biomaterial itself. Here, we present a strategy to control the distributions of soluble chemicals within the scaffold with convective mass transfer via microfluidic networks embedded directly within the cell-seeded biomaterial. Our presentation of this strategy includes: a lithographic technique to build functional microfluidic structures within a calcium alginate hydrogel seeded with cells; characterization of this process with respect to microstructural fidelity and cell viability; characterization of convective and diffusive mass transfer of small and large solutes within this microfluidic scaffold; and demonstration of temporal and spatial control of the distribution of non-reactive solutes and reactive solutes (that is, metabolites) within the bulk of the scaffold. This approach to control the chemical environment on a micrometre scale within a macroscopic scaffold could aid in engineering complex tissues."
1333,The control of human mesenchymal cell differentiation using nanoscale symmetry and disorder,2007-09-23,"A key tenet of bone tissue engineering is the development of scaffold materials that can stimulate stem cell differentiation in the absence of chemical treatment to become osteoblasts without compromising material properties. At present, conventional implant materials fail owing to encapsulation by soft tissue, rather than direct bone bonding. Here, we demonstrate the use of nanoscale disorder to stimulate human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to produce bone mineral in vitro, in the absence of osteogenic supplements. This approach has similar efficiency to that of cells cultured with osteogenic media. In addition, the current studies show that topographically treated MSCs have a distinct differentiation profile compared with those treated with osteogenic media, which has implications for cell therapies."
1334,Large triangular single crystals formed by mild annealing of self-organized silver nanocrystals,2007-09-16,"Nanocrystal organizations represent a new generation of materials with specific properties compared with those of isolated nanocrystals and of the bulk material. Here, we present the first intrinsic crystalline growth properties of highly ordered mono- and multilayers of 5 nm silver nanocrystals. Triangular single crystals with face-centred-cubic structures are obtained by annealing the ordered nanocrystals under atmospheric pressure at 50 ∘C. The triangles are mixed with well-crystallized coalesced particles of various shapes. Their size depends on the initial nanocrystal ordering range on the substrate, which is local on amorphous carbon and highly extended on highly oriented pyrolitic graphite (HOPG). Hence, the single-crystal size is larger on HOPG than on amorphous carbon. These observations show that the crystalline growth properties of silver nanocrystals can be tailored by controlling their organization. Furthermore, on HOPG an epitaxial orientation of the triangles is observed."
1335,Epitaxial integration of the highly spin-polarized ferromagnetic semiconductor EuO with silicon and GaN,2007-09-16,"Doped EuO is an attractive material for the fabrication of proof-of-concept spintronic devices. Yet for decades its use has been hindered by its instability in air and the difficulty of preparing and patterning high-quality thin films. Here, we establish EuO as the pre-eminent material for the direct integration of a carrier-concentration-matched half-metal with the long-spin-lifetime semiconductors silicon and GaN, using methods that transcend these difficulties. Andreev reflection measurements reveal that the spin polarization in doped epitaxial EuO films exceeds 90%, demonstrating that EuO is a half-metal even when highly doped. Furthermore, EuO is epitaxially integrated with silicon and GaN. These results demonstrate the high potential of EuO for spintronic devices."
1336,Substrate-induced bandgap opening in epitaxial graphene,2007-09-09,"Graphene has shown great application potential as the host material for next-generation electronic devices. However, despite its intriguing properties, one of the biggest hurdles for graphene to be useful as an electronic material is the lack of an energy gap in its electronic spectra. This, for example, prevents the use of graphene in making transistors. Although several proposals have been made to open a gap in graphene’s electronic spectra, they all require complex engineering of the graphene layer. Here, we show that when graphene is epitaxially grown on SiC substrate, a gap of ≈0.26 eV is produced. This gap decreases as the sample thickness increases and eventually approaches zero when the number of layers exceeds four. We propose that the origin of this gap is the breaking of sublattice symmetry owing to the graphene–substrate interaction. We believe that our results highlight a promising direction for bandgap engineering of graphene."
1337,Order causes secondary Bragg peaks in soft materials,2007-08-26,"Highly ordered soft materials exhibit Bragg peaks that cannot be indexed assuming homogeneous crystal structures. Their origin has been attributed to changes in the crystal structure that are induced by the ordering process such as by application of external fields. This would restrict the use for the generation of highly ordered nano- and microstructured materials where a homogeneous crystal structure is a key requirement. Here, we demonstrate that these Bragg peaks are an inherent property of homogeneous ordered soft materials related to the finite coherence of their crystalline lattice. Their consideration allows a detailed and quantitative analysis of the diffraction patterns of seemingly unrelated materials such as lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases, mesoporous materials, colloidal dispersions, block copolymers, electrorheological fluids and photonic crystals. It further enables us to develop a concise picture of order, line density, field-induced orientation and epitaxial relations for soft-material lattices."
1338,Phason dynamics in nonlinear photonic quasicrystals,2007-08-12,"We study the dynamics of phasons in a nonlinear photonic quasicrystal. The photonic quasicrystal is formed by optical induction, and its dynamics is initiated by allowing the light waves inducing the quasicrystal to nonlinearly interact with one another. We show quantitatively that, when phason strain is introduced in a controlled manner, it relaxes through the nonlinear interactions within the photonic quasicrystal. We establish experimentally that the relaxation rate of phason strain in the quasicrystal is substantially lower than the relaxation rate of phonon strain, as predicted for atomic quasicrystals. Finally, we monitor and identify individual ‘atomic-scale’ phason flips occurring in the photonic quasicrystal as its phason strain relaxes, as well as noise-induced phason fluctuations."
1339,Surfactant-assisted fabrication of free-standing inorganic sheets covering an array of micrometre-sized holes,2007-08-05,"Thin inorganic membranes are of importance to a number of applications such as sensing, catalysis and separation. Here, we present a method to fabricate free-standing sheets of various inorganic materials such as C, Si, Pt, Fe and CdSe with thicknesses ranging from a few to a hundred nanometres. First, an array of holes in a flat substrate was uniformly covered by dried-foam-film (DFF) self-standing reversed bilayers of surfactants. As the surfactant bilayers are sufficiently robust to allow deposition of amorphous films, a variety of inorganic films were then fabricated on the DFFs using physical deposition techniques such as sputtering, electron-beam deposition and thermal deposition. The films thus obtained showed improved thermal stability compared with the DFFs. This fabrication method therefore provides a flexible and reliable way to readily produce free-standing inorganic multilayered structures."
1340,High-resolution electrohydrodynamic jet printing,2007-08-05,"Efforts to adapt and extend graphic arts printing techniques for demanding device applications in electronics, biotechnology and microelectromechanical systems have grown rapidly in recent years. Here, we describe the use of electrohydrodynamically induced fluid flows through fine microcapillary nozzles for jet printing of patterns and functional devices with submicrometre resolution. Key aspects of the physics of this approach, which has some features in common with related but comparatively low-resolution techniques for graphic arts, are revealed through direct high-speed imaging of the droplet formation processes. Printing of complex patterns of inks, ranging from insulating and conducting polymers, to solution suspensions of silicon nanoparticles and rods, to single-walled carbon nanotubes, using integrated computer-controlled printer systems illustrates some of the capabilities. High-resolution printed metal interconnects, electrodes and probing pads for representative circuit patterns and functional transistors with critical dimensions as small as 1 μm demonstrate potential applications in printed electronics."
1341,Six-fold-coordinated phosphorus by oxygen in AlPO,2007-07-29,"AlPO4 belongs to the berlinite quartz homeotype family, which has been the subject of intense high-pressure research triggered by the supposed existence of reversible pressure-induced amorphization. X-ray diffraction experiments, complemented with ab initio calculations, demonstrate the existence of two high-pressure crystalline polymorphs and show that AlPO4 shares the same two-stage densification mechanism as silica. In the first step, a compact hexagonal sublattice of oxygen atoms is formed. In the second step, the cations redistribute in the interstices giving rise to a monoclinic distorted CaCl2 phase. The most outstanding feature of the phase is that phosphorous becomes six-fold coordinated by oxygen, adopting a configuration unknown so far in solid-state science. This finding opens possibilities in the high-pressure chemistry of phosphorus. The close relationship of AlPO4 with silica suggests the existence of completely unexplored families of compounds analogous to those of six-fold-coordinated silicates but based on PO6."
1342,Charging and discharging of single conjugated-polymer nanoparticles,2007-07-22,"Despite intense, long-term interest in organic semiconductors from both an applied and fundamental perspective, key aspects of the electronic properties of these materials remain poorly defined. A particularly challenging problem is the molecular nature of positive charge carriers, that is, holes or oxidized species in organics. Here, the unique ability of single-molecule spectroelectrochemistry (SMS-EC) to unravel complex electrochemical process in heterogeneous media is used to study the oxidation of nanoparticles of the conjugated polymer poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole). A reversible hole-injection charging process has been observed that occurs primarily by initial injection of shallow (untrapped) holes, but soon after the injection, a small fraction of the holes becomes deeply trapped. Good agreement between experimental data and simulations strongly supports the presence of deep traps in the studied nanoparticles and highlights the ability of SMS-EC to study energetics and dynamics of deep traps in organic materials at the nanoscale."
1343,Electronic control of Ca,2007-07-22,"Cells and tissues use finely regulated ion fluxes for their intra- and intercellular communication. Technologies providing spatial and temporal control for studies of such fluxes are however, limited. We have developed an electrophoretic ion pump made of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene sulphonate) (PEDOT:PSS) to mediate electronic control of the ion homeostasis in neurons. Ion delivery from a source reservoir to a receiving electrolyte via a PEDOT:PSS thin-film channel was achieved by electronic addressing. Ions are delivered in high quantities at an associated on/off ratio exceeding 300. This induces physiological signalling events that can be recorded at the single-cell level. Furthermore, miniaturization of the device to a 50-μm-wide channel allows for stimulation of individual cells. As this technology platform allows for electronic control of ion signalling in individual cells with proper spatial and temporal resolution, it will be useful in further studies of communication in biological systems."
1344,Shaping binary metal nanocrystals through epitaxial seeded growth,2007-07-08,"Morphological control of nanocrystals has become increasingly important, as many of their physical and chemical properties are highly shape dependent. Nanocrystal shape control for both single- and multiple-material systems, however, remains empirical and challenging. New methods need to be explored for the rational synthetic design of heterostructures with controlled morphology. Overgrowth of a different material on well-faceted seeds, for example, allows for the use of the defined seed morphology to control nucleation and growth of the secondary structure. Here, we have used highly faceted cubic Pt seeds to direct the epitaxial overgrowth of a secondary metal. We demonstrate this concept with lattice-matched Pd to produce conformal shape-controlled core–shell particles, and then extend it to lattice-mismatched Au to give anisotropic growth. Seeding with faceted nanocrystals may have significant potential towards the development of shape-controlled heterostructures with defined interfaces."
1345,Self-assembly of metal–polymer analogues of amphiphilic triblock copolymers,2007-07-08,"Organized arrays of anisotropic nanoparticles show electronic and optical properties that originate from the coupling of shape-dependent properties of the individual nanorods. The organization of nanorods in a controllable and predictable way provides a route to the fabrication of new materials and functional devices. So far, significant progress has been achieved in the self-assembly of nanorod arrays, yet the realization of a range of different structures requires changing the surface chemistry of the nanoparticles. We organized metal nanorods in structures with varying geometries by using a striking analogy between amphiphilic ABA triblock copolymers and the hydrophilic nanorods tethered with hydrophobic polymer chains at both ends. The self-assembly was tuneable and reversible and it was achieved solely by changing the solvent quality for the constituent blocks. This approach provides a new route to the organization of anisotropic nanoparticles by using the strategies that are established for the self-assembly of block copolymers."
1346,Tunable electronic interfaces between bulk semiconductors and ligand-stabilized nanoparticle assemblies,2007-06-24,"Interfaces between nanoscale and bulk electroactive materials are important for the design of electronic devices using solution-processed nanoparticles. We report that thin films of hexanethiolate-capped gold nanoparticles with a core diameter of 2.1±0.4 nm deposited onto n-InP wafers form Schottky contacts whose barrier height can be actively tuned from 0.27±0.03 to 1.11±0.09 eV by electrochemically adjusting the nanoparticle Fermi level. This result is remarkable because interfacial barriers at conventional metal–semiconductor contacts are largely insensitive to the initial Fermi level of the metal. Furthermore, it highlights two general features of solution-processed nanoparticle assemblies in comparison with traditional bulk electronic materials: (1) the ability of ions to permeate the nanoparticle assembly enables the electrochemical injection of charges and hence active control of the Fermi level, and (2) ligand passivation of nanoparticle surfaces prevents interfacial reactions with the semiconductor that could otherwise lead to strong Fermi-level pinning."
1347,Nano-chessboard superlattices formed by spontaneous phase separation in oxides,2007-06-24,"The use of bottom-up fabrication of nanostructures for nanotechnology inherently requires two-dimensional control of the nanostructures at a particular surface. This could in theory be achieved crystallographically with a structure whose three-dimensional unit cell has two or more—tuneable—dimensions on the nanometre scale. Here, we present what is to our knowledge the first example of a truly periodic two-dimensional nanometre-scale phase separation in any inorganic material, and demonstrate our ability to tune the unit-cell dimensions. As such, it represents great potential for the use of standard ceramic processing methods for nanotechnology. The phase separation occurs spontaneously in the homologous series of the perovskite-based Li-ion conductor, (Nd2/3−xLi3x)TiO3, to give two phases whose dimensions both extend into the nanometre scale. This unique feature could lead to its application as a template for the assembly of nanostructures or molecular monolayers."
1348,Electrochemically assisted self-assembly of mesoporous silica thin films,2007-06-24,"Supported mesostructured thin films are of major importance for applications in optical, electrochemical and sensing devices. However, good performance is restricted to mesostructured phases ensuring good accessibility from the film surface, which would be straightforward with cylindrical pores oriented normal to the underlying support, but this remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that electrochemistry is likely to induce self-assembly of surfactant-templated (organo)silica thin films on various conducting supports, homogeneously over wide areas. The method involves the application of a suitable cathodic potential to an electrode immersed in a surfactant-containing hydrolysed sol solution to generate the hydroxyl ions that are necessary to catalyse polycondensation of the precursors and self-assembly of hexagonally packed one-dimensional channels that grow perpendicularly to the electrode surface. The method is compatible with controlled and localized deposition on heterogeneous supports, opening the way to electrochemically driven nanolithography for designing complex patterns of widely accessible mesostructured materials."
1349,Ice nanoclusters at hydrophobic metal surfaces,2007-06-17,"Studies of the structure of supported water clusters provide a means for obtaining a rigorous molecular-scale description of the initial stages of heterogeneous ice nucleation: a process of importance to fields as diverse as atmospheric chemistry, astrophysics and biology. Here, we report the observation and characterization of metal-supported water hexamers and a family of hydrated nanoclusters—heptamers, octamers and nonamers—through a combination of low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments and first-principles electronic-structure calculations. Aside from achieving unprecedented resolution of the cyclic water hexamer—the so-called smallest piece of ice—we identify and explain a hitherto unknown competition between the ability of water molecules to simultaneously bond to a substrate and to accept hydrogen bonds. This competition also rationalizes previous structure predictions for water clusters on other substrates."
1350,Substrate-induced magnetic ordering and switching of iron porphyrin molecules,2007-06-10,"To realize molecular spintronic devices, it is important to externally control the magnetization of a molecular magnet. One class of materials particularly promising as building blocks for molecular electronic devices is the paramagnetic porphyrin molecule in contact with a metallic substrate. Here, we study the structural orientation and the magnetic coupling of in-situ-sublimated Fe porphyrin molecules on ferromagnetic Ni and Co films on Cu(100). Our studies involve X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism experiments. In a combined experimental and computational study we demonstrate that owing to an indirect, superexchange interaction between Fe atoms in the molecules and atoms in the substrate (Co or Ni) the paramagnetic molecules can be made to order ferromagnetically. The Fe magnetic moment can be rotated along directions in plane as well as out of plane by a magnetization reversal of the substrate, thereby opening up an avenue for spin-dependent molecular electronics."
1351,Warping a single Mn acceptor wavefunction by straining the GaAs host,2007-06-10,"Transition-metal dopants such as Mn determine the ferromagnetism in dilute magnetic semiconductors such as Ga1−xMnxAs. Recently, the acceptor states of Mn dopants in GaAs were found to be highly anisotropic owing to the symmetry of the host crystal. Here, we show how the shape of such a state can be modified by local strain. The Mn acceptors near InAs quantum dots are mapped at room temperature by scanning tunnelling microscopy. Dramatic distortions and a reduction in the symmetry of the wavefunction of the hole bound to the Mn acceptor are observed originating from strain induced by quantum dots. Calculations of the acceptor-state wavefunction in the presence of strain, within a tight-binding model and within an effective-mass model, agree with the experimentally observed shape. The magnetic easy axes of strained lightly doped Ga1−xMnxAs can be explained on the basis of the observed local density of states for the single Mn spin."
1352,The self-organizing properties of squid reflectin protein,2007-06-03,"Reflectins, a recently identified protein family that is enriched in aromatic and sulphur-containing amino acids, are used by certain cephalopods to manage and manipulate incident light in their environment. These proteins are the predominant constituent of nanoscaled photonic structures that function in static and adaptive colouration, extending visual performance and intra-species communication. Our investigation into recombinantly expressed reflectin has revealed unanticipated self-assembling and behavioural properties, and we demonstrate that reflectin can be easily processed into thin films, photonic grating structures and fibres. Our findings represent a key step in our understanding of the property–function relationships of this unique family of reflective proteins."
1353,Dynamic ,2007-05-27,"Understanding and improving the behaviour of supported precious-metal catalysts for a vast array of environmentally and economically important processes is a central area of research in catalysis. The removal of toxic gases such as CO and NO, without forming others (such as N2O), is particularly important. By combining energy-dispersive extended X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy with a vibrational spectroscopy (infrared) and mass spectrometry, at high time resolution, in a single in situ experiment, we dynamically observe and quantify CO-, and subsequent NO-, induced size and shape changes of Pd nanoparticles during CO/NO cycling. In doing so we demonstrate a novel, non-oxidative redispersion (for example, an increase in metal surface area) mechanism, and suggest a model to bridge the structural and reactive functions of supported Pd catalysts."
1354,Origin and control of high-temperature ferromagnetism in semiconductors,2007-05-21,"The extensive experimental and computational search for multifunctional materials has resulted in the development of semiconductor and oxide systems, such as (Ga,Mn)N, (Zn,Cr)Te and HfO2, which exhibit surprisingly stable ferromagnetic signatures despite having a small or nominally zero concentration of magnetic elements. Here, we show that the ferromagnetism of (Zn,Cr)Te, and the associated magnetooptical and magnetotransport functionalities, are dominated by the formation of Cr-rich (Zn,Cr)Te metallic nanocrystals embedded in the Cr-poor (Zn,Cr)Te matrix. Importantly, the formation of these nanocrystals can be controlled by manipulating the charge state of the Cr ions during the epitaxy. The findings provide insight into the origin of ferromagnetism in a broad range of semiconductors and oxides, and indicate possible functionalities of these composite systems. Furthermore, they demonstrate a bottom-up method for self-organized nanostructure fabrication that is applicable to any system in which the charge state of a constituent depends on the Fermi-level position in the host semiconductor."
1355,Nanoscale heterogeneity promotes energy dissipation in bone,2007-05-21,"Nanomechanical heterogeneity is expected to influence elasticity, damage, fracture and remodelling of bone. Here, the spatial distribution of nanomechanical properties of bone is quantified at the length scale of individual collagen fibrils. Our results show elaborate patterns of stiffness ranging from ∼2 to 30 GPa, which do not correlate directly with topographical features and hence are attributed to underlying local structural and compositional variations. We propose a new energy-dissipation mechanism arising from nanomechanical heterogeneity, which offers a means for ductility enhancement, damage evolution and toughening. This hypothesis is supported by computational simulations that incorporate the nanoscale experimental results. These simulations predict that non-uniform inelastic deformation over larger areas and increased energy dissipation arising from nanoscale heterogeneity lead to markedly different biomechanical properties compared with a uniform material. The fundamental concepts discovered here are applicable to a broad class of biological materials and may serve as a design consideration for biologically inspired materials technologies."
1356,Metallated conjugated polymers as a new avenue towards high-efficiency polymer solar cells,2007-05-13,"Bulk heterojunction solar cells have been extensively studied owing to their great potential for cost-effective photovoltaic devices. Although recent advances resulted in the fabrication of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/fullerene derivative based solar cells with efficiencies in the range 4.4–5.0%, theoretical calculations predict that the development of novel donor materials with a lower bandgap is required to exceed the power-conversion efficiency of 10%. However, all of the lower bandgap polymers developed so far have failed to reach the efficiency of P3HT-based cells. To address this issue, we synthesized a soluble, intensely coloured platinum metallopolyyne with a low bandgap of 1.85 eV. The solar cells, containing metallopolyyne/fullerene derivative blends as the photoactive material, showed a power-conversion efficiency with an average of 4.1%, without annealing or the use of spacer layers needed to achieve comparable efficiency with P3HT. This clearly demonstrates the potential of metallated conjugated polymers for efficient photovoltaic devices."
1357,Spin-torque oscillator using a perpendicular polarizer and a planar free layer,2007-04-29,"Spintronics materials have recently been considered for radio-frequency devices such as oscillators by exploiting the transfer of spin angular momentum between a spin-polarized electrical current and the magnetic nanostructure it passes through. While previous spin-transfer oscillators (STOs) were based on in-plane magnetized structures, here we present the realization of an STO that contains a perpendicular spin current polarizer combined with an in-plane magnetized free layer. This device is characterized by high-frequency oscillations of the free-layer magnetization, consistent with out-of-plane steady-state precessions induced at the threshold current by a spin-transfer torque from perpendicularly polarized electrons. The results are summarized in static and dynamic current–field state diagrams and will be of importance for the design of STOs with enhanced output signals."
1358,Highly ordered nanowire arrays on plastic substrates for ultrasensitive flexible chemical sensors,2007-04-22,"The development of a robust method for integrating high-performance semiconductors on flexible plastics could enable exciting avenues in fundamental research and novel applications. One area of vital relevance is chemical and biological sensing, which if implemented on biocompatible substrates, could yield breakthroughs in implantable or wearable monitoring systems. Semiconducting nanowires (and nanotubes) are particularly sensitive chemical sensors because of their high surface-to-volume ratios. Here, we present a scalable and parallel process for transferring hundreds of pre-aligned silicon nanowires onto plastic to yield highly ordered films for low-power sensor chips. The nanowires are excellent field-effect transistors, and, as sensors, exhibit parts-per-billion sensitivity to NO2, a hazardous pollutant. We also use SiO2 surface chemistries to construct a ‘nano-electronic nose’ library, which can distinguish acetone and hexane vapours via distributed responses. The excellent sensing performance coupled with bendable plastic could open up opportunities in portable, wearable or even implantable sensors."
1359,Strong isotropic flux pinning in solution-derived YBa,2007-04-22,"Power applications of superconductors will be tremendously boosted if an effective method for magnetic flux immobilization is discovered. Here, we report the most efficient vortex-pinning mechanism reported so far which, in addition, is based on a low-cost chemical solution deposition technique. A dense array of defects in the superconducting matrix is induced in YBa2Cu3O7−x–BaZrO3 nanocomposites where BaZrO3 nanodots are randomly oriented. Non-coherent interfaces are the driving force for generating a new type of nanostructured superconductor. Angle-dependent critical-current measurements demonstrate that a strong and isotropic flux-pinning mechanism is extremely effective at high temperatures and high magnetic fields leading to high-temperature superconductors with record values of pinning force. The maximum vortex-pinning force achieved at 65 K, 78 GN m−3, is 500% higher than that of the best low-temperature NbTi superconductors at 4.2 K and so a great wealth of high-field applications will be possible at high temperatures."
1360,Multifunctional chondroitin sulphate for cartilage tissue–biomaterial integration,2007-04-15,"A biologically active, high-strength tissue adhesive is needed for numerous medical applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Integration of biomaterials or implants with surrounding native tissue is crucial for both immediate functionality and long-term performance of the tissue. Here, we use the biopolymer chondroitin sulphate (CS), one of the major components of cartilage extracellular matrix, to develop a novel bioadhesive that is readily applied and acts quickly. CS was chemically functionalized with methacrylate and aldehyde groups on the polysaccharide backbone to chemically bridge biomaterials and tissue proteins via a twofold covalent link. Three-dimensional hydrogels (with and without cells) bonded to articular cartilage defects. In in vitro and in vivo functional studies this approach led to mechanical stability of the hydrogel and tissue repair in cartilage defects."
1361,Extrafluorescent electroluminescence in organic light-emitting devices,2007-04-08,"Organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) are a promising technology for flat-panel displays and solid-state lighting. While OLED efficiencies have increased dramatically in recent years, further progress is complicated by the fact that the vast majority of organic materials are fluorescent and therefore emit only from molecular excited states (‘excitons’) with spin 0, or ‘singlet’ spin symmetry. Here, we demonstrate the ability to manipulate the fraction of excitons which form as singlets in fluorescent materials by altering the OLED structure. We insert a mixing layer that affects only charge-transfer (CT) states, which are the precursors to excitons. As a result, we triple the singlet fraction and the efficiency of the red fluorophore DCM2. We term fluorescence enhanced by CT spin mixing ‘extrafluorescence’, and show that its origin is in part an inversion of the usual energetic ordering of the singlet and triplet CT states."
1362,Composition and density of nanoscale calcium–silicate–hydrate in cement,2007-03-25,"Although Portland cement concrete is the world’s most widely used manufactured material, basic questions persist regarding its internal structure and water content, and their effect on concrete behaviour. Here, for the first time without recourse to drying methods, we measure the composition and solid density of the principal binding reaction product of cement hydration, calcium–silicate–hydrate (C–S–H) gel, one of the most complex of all gels. We also quantify a nanoscale calcium hydroxide phase that coexists with C–S–H gel. By combining small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering data, and by exploiting the hydrogen/deuterium neutron isotope effect both in water and methanol, we determine the mean formula and mass density of the nanoscale C–S–H gel particles in hydrating cement. We show that the formula, (CaO)1.7(SiO2)(H2O)1.80, and density, 2.604 Mg m−3, differ from previous values for C–S–H gel, associated with specific drying conditions. Whereas previous studies have classified water within C–S–H gel by how tightly it is bound, in this study we classify water by its location—with implications for defining the chemically active (C–S–H) surface area within cement, and for predicting concrete properties."
1363,Tunnel junctions with multiferroic barriers,2007-03-11,"Multiferroics are singular materials that can exhibit simultaneously electric and magnetic orders. Some are ferroelectric and ferromagnetic and provide the opportunity to encode information in electric polarization and magnetization to obtain four logic states. However, such materials are rare and schemes allowing a simple electrical readout of these states have not been demonstrated in the same device. Here, we show that films of La0.1Bi0.9MnO3 (LBMO) are ferromagnetic and ferroelectric, and retain both ferroic properties down to a thickness of 2 nm. We have integrated such ultrathin multiferroic films as barriers in spin-filter-type tunnel junctions that exploit the magnetic and ferroelectric degrees of freedom of LBMO. Whereas ferromagnetism permits read operations reminiscent of magnetic random access memories (MRAM), the electrical switching evokes a ferroelectric RAM write operation. Significantly, our device does not require the destructive ferroelectric readout, and therefore represents an advance over the original four-state memory concept based on multiferroics."
1364,Exploration of nanostructured channel systems with single-molecule probes,2007-03-11,"Molecular movement in confined spaces is of broad scientific and technological importance in areas ranging from molecular sieving and membrane separation to active transport through ion channels. Whereas measurements of ensemble diffusion provide information about the overall behaviour of the guest in a porous host, tracking individual molecules provides insight into both the heterogeneity and the mechanistic details of molecular diffusion as well as into the structure of the host. Here, we show how single dye molecules can be used as nanoscale probes to map out the structure of mesoporous silica channel systems prepared as thin films via cooperative self-assembly of surfactant molecules with polymerizable silicate species. The dye molecules act as beacons while they diffuse through the different structural phases of the host: the structure of the trajectories, the diffusivities and the orientation of single molecules are distinctive for molecules travelling in the lamellar and the hexagonal mesophases. These experiments reveal unprecedented details of the host structure, its domains and the accessibility as well as the connectivity of the channel system."
1365,The mechanism of morphogenesis in a phase-separating concentrated multicomponent alloy,2007-02-25,"What determines the morphology of a decomposing alloy? Besides the well-established effect of the nucleation barrier, we demonstrate that, in a concentrated multicomponent Ni(Al,Cr) alloy, the details of the diffusion mechanism strongly affect the kinetic pathway of precipitation. Our argument is based on the combined use of atomic-scale observations, using three-dimensional atom-probe tomography (3D APT), lattice kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and the theory of diffusion. By an optimized choice of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters, we first reproduce the 3D APT observations, in particular the early-stage transient occurrence of coagulated precipitates. We then modify the kinetic correlations among the atomic fluxes in the simulation, without altering the thermodynamic driving force for phase separation, by changing the vacancy–solute interactions, resulting in a suppression of coagulation. Such changes can only be quantitatively accounted for with non-zero values for the off-diagonal terms of the Onsager matrix, at variance with classical models."
1366,Radiation-induced amorphization resistance and radiation tolerance in structurally related oxides,2007-02-25,"Ceramics destined for use in hostile environments such as nuclear reactors or waste immobilization must be highly durable and especially resistant to radiation damage effects. In particular, they must not be prone to amorphization or swelling. Few ceramics meet these criteria and much work has been devoted in recent years to identifying radiation-tolerant ceramics and the characteristics that promote radiation tolerance. Here, we examine trends in radiation damage behaviour for families of compounds related by crystal structure. Specifically, we consider oxides with structures related to the fluorite crystal structure. We demonstrate that improved amorphization resistance characteristics are to be found in compounds that have a natural tendency to accommodate lattice disorder."
1367,Microscopic annealing process and its impact on superconductivity in ,2007-02-18,"High-transition-temperature superconductivity arises in copper oxides when holes or electrons are doped into the CuO2 planes of their insulating parent compounds. Whereas hole doping quickly induces metallic behaviour and superconductivity in many cuprates, electron doping alone is insufficient in materials such as R2CuO4 (R is Nd, Pr, La, Ce and so on), where it is necessary to anneal an as-grown sample in a low-oxygen environment to remove a tiny amount of oxygen in order to induce superconductivity. Here we show that the microscopic process of oxygen reduction repairs Cu deficiencies in the as-grown materials and creates oxygen vacancies in the stoichiometric CuO2 planes, effectively reducing disorder and providing itinerant carriers for superconductivity. The resolution of this long-standing materials issue suggests that the fundamental mechanism for superconductivity is the same for electron- and hole-doped copper oxides."
1368,Trends in electrocatalysis on extended and nanoscale Pt-bimetallic alloy surfaces,2007-02-18,"One of the key objectives in fuel-cell technology is to improve and reduce Pt loading as the oxygen-reduction catalyst. Here, we show a fundamental relationship in electrocatalytic trends on Pt3M (M=Ni, Co, Fe, Ti, V) surfaces between the experimentally determined surface electronic structure (the d-band centre) and activity for the oxygen-reduction reaction. This relationship exhibits ‘volcano-type’ behaviour, where the maximum catalytic activity is governed by a balance between adsorption energies of reactive intermediates and surface coverage by spectator (blocking) species. The electrocatalytic trends established for extended surfaces are used to explain the activity pattern of Pt3M nanocatalysts as well as to provide a fundamental basis for the catalytic enhancement of cathode catalysts. By combining simulations with experiments in the quest for surfaces with desired activity, an advanced concept in nanoscale catalyst engineering has been developed."
1369,Remotely powered self-propelling particles and micropumps based on miniature diodes,2007-02-11,"Microsensors and micromachines that are capable of self-propulsion through fluids could revolutionize many aspects of technology. Few principles to propel such devices and supply them with energy are known. Here, we show that various types of miniature semiconductor diodes floating in water act as self-propelling particles when powered by an external alternating electric field. The millimetre-sized diodes rectify the voltage induced between their electrodes. The resulting particle-localized electro-osmotic flow propels them in the direction of either the cathode or the anode, depending on their surface charge. These rudimentary self-propelling devices can emit light or respond to light and could be controlled by internal logic. Diodes embedded in the walls of microfluidic channels provide locally distributed pumping or mixing functions powered by a global external field. The combined application of a.c. and d.c. fields in such devices allows decoupling of the velocity of the particles and the liquid and could be used for on-chip separations."
1370,Peak effect versus skating in high-temperature nanofriction,2007-02-11,"The physics of sliding nanofriction at high temperature near the substrate melting point, TM, is so far unexplored. We conducted simulations of hard tips sliding on a prototype non-melting surface, NaCl(100), revealing two distinct and opposite phenomena for ploughing and for grazing friction in this regime. We found a frictional drop close to TM for deep ploughing and wear, but on the contrary a frictional rise for grazing, wearless sliding. For both phenomena, we obtain a fresh microscopic understanding, relating the former to ‘skating’ through a local liquid cloud, and the latter to linear response properties of the free substrate surface. We argue that both phenomena occur more generally on surfaces other than NaCl and should be pursued experimentally. Most metals, in particular those possessing one or more close-packed non-melting surfaces, such as Pb, Al or Au(111), are likely to behave similarly."
1371,A flexible interpenetrating coordination framework with a bimodal porous functionality,2007-01-28,"Introducing a functional part into open-framework materials that tunes the pore size/shape and overall porous activity will open new routes in framework engineering and in the fabrication of new materials. We have designed and synthesized a bimodal microporous twofold interpenetrating network {[Ni(bpe)2(N(CN)2)](N(CN)2)(5H2O)}n (1), with two types of channel for anionic N(CN)2− (dicyanamide) and neutral water molecules, respectively. The dehydrated framework provides a dual function of specific anion exchange of free N(CN)2− for the smaller N3− anions and selective gas sorption. The N3-exchanged framework leads to a dislocation of the mutual positions of the two interpenetrating frameworks, resulting in an increase in the effective pore size in one of the counterparts of the channels and a higher accommodation of adsorbate than in the as-synthesized framework (1), showing the first case of controlled sorption properties in flexible porous frameworks."
1372,Giant thermoelectric Seebeck coefficient of a two-dimensional electron gas in SrTiO,2007-01-21,"Enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient (S ) without reducing the electrical conductivity (σ) is essential to realize practical thermoelectric materials exhibiting a dimensionless figure of merit (Z T=S2·σ·T·κ−1) exceeding 2, where T is the absolute temperature and κ is the thermal conductivity. Here, we demonstrate that a high-density two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) confined within a unit cell layer thickness in SrTiO3 yields unusually large |S|, approximately five times larger than that of SrTiO3 bulks, while maintaining a high σ2DEG. In the best case, we observe |S|=850 μV K−1 and σ2DEG=1.4×103 S cm−1. In addition, by using the κ of bulk single-crystal SrTiO3 at room temperature, we estimate ZT∼2.4 for the 2DEG, corresponding to ZT∼0.24 for a complete device having the 2DEG as the active region. The present approach using a 2DEG provides a new route to realize practical thermoelectric materials without the use of toxic heavy elements."
1373,Nanoparticle-tuned assembly and disassembly of mesostructured silica hybrids,2007-01-21,"Although silica nanoparticles are used as building blocks in nature and synthetic mesostructures, the influence of nanoparticle characteristics on the assembly and disassembly of mesostructured silica has not been investigated. We demonstrate that nanoparticle size and size distribution allow us to control the assembly of silica-type mesostructures and that, because of the discrete nature of nanoparticles, we can disassemble these mesostructures into a rich variety of structural building units. When assembling mesostructures, nanoparticles undergo size-dependent segregation once the nanoparticle diameter exceeds a critical size threshold, which is approximated by the root-mean-square end-to-end distance of the hydrophilic block of the block copolymer. Using this phenomenon, we direct gold–silica core–shell nanoparticles into the segregated regions of silica-type mesostructures, demonstrating the ability to precisely place nanoparticles and create compositionally heterogeneous, functional mesostructures. We further show that, because the mesostructures are composed of nanoparticles, they can be disassembled into nanotubes, hexapods and other complex, well-defined structural units, thereby introducing the concept of retrosynthesis to materials chemistry. Our results demonstrate how nanoparticle characteristics influence the structure and properties of nanoparticle-derived mesostructures. Size-dependent segregation and disassembly should improve structure control at the near-molecular level and should be applicable to a wide range of nanoparticle-derived mesostructures."
1374,A biomimetic three-dimensional woven composite scaffold for functional tissue engineering of cartilage,2007-01-21,"Tissue engineering seeks to repair or regenerate tissues through combinations of implanted cells, biomaterial scaffolds and biologically active molecules. The rapid restoration of tissue biomechanical function remains an important challenge, emphasizing the need to replicate structural and mechanical properties using novel scaffold designs. Here we present a microscale 3D weaving technique to generate anisotropic 3D woven structures as the basis for novel composite scaffolds that are consolidated with a chondrocyte–hydrogel mixture into cartilage tissue constructs. Composite scaffolds show mechanical properties of the same order of magnitude as values for native articular cartilage, as measured by compressive, tensile and shear testing. Moreover, our findings showed that porous composite scaffolds could be engineered with initial properties that reproduce the anisotropy, viscoelasticity and tension–compression nonlinearity of native articular cartilage. Such scaffolds uniquely combine the potential for load-bearing immediately after implantation in vivo with biological support for cell-based tissue regeneration without requiring cultivation in vitro."
1375,Water-filled single-wall carbon nanotubes as molecular nanovalves,2007-01-21,"It is known that at low temperature, water inside single-wall carbon nanotubes (water–SWNTs) undergoes a structural transition to form tube-like solid structures. The resulting ice NTs are hollow cylinders with diameters comparable to those of typical gas molecules. Hence, the gas-adsorption properties of ice– and water–SWNTs are of interest. Here, we carry out the first systematic investigation into the stability of water–SWNTs in various gas atmospheres below 0.1 MPa by means of electrical resistance, X-ray diffraction, NMR measurements and molecular dynamics calculations. It is found that the resistivity of water–SWNTs exhibits a significant increase in gas atmospheres below a critical temperature Tc, at which a particular type of atmospheric gas molecule enters the SWNTs in an on–off fashion. On the basis of this phenomenon, it is proposed that water–SWNTs can be used to fabricate a new type of molecular nanovalve."
1376,Synergism in binary nanocrystal superlattices leads to enhanced p-type conductivity in self-assembled PbTe/Ag,2007-01-21,"The ordered cocrystallization of nanoparticles into binary superlattices enables close contact of nanocrystals with distinct physical properties, providing a route to ‘metamaterials’ design. Here we present the first electronic measurements of multicomponent nanocrystal solids composed of PbTe and Ag2Te, demonstrating synergistic effects leading to enhanced p-type conductivity. First, syntheses of size-tuneable PbTe and Ag2Te nanocrystals are presented, along with deposition as thin-film nanocrystal solids, whose electronic transport properties are characterized. Next, assembly of PbTe and Ag2Te nanocrystals into AB binary nanocrystal superlattices is demonstrated. Furthermore, binary composites of varying PbTe–Ag2Te stoichiometry (1:1 and 5:1) are prepared and electronically characterized. These composites show strongly enhanced (conductance ∼100-fold increased in 1:1 composites over the sum of individual conductances of single-component PbTe and Ag2Te films) p-type electronic conductivity. This observation, consistent with the role of Ag2Te as a p-type dopant in bulk PbTe, demonstrates that nanocrystals can behave as dopants in nanostructured assemblies."
1377,Controlled insulator-to-metal transformation in printable polymer composites with nanometal clusters,2006-12-17,"Although organic semiconductors have received the most attention, the development of compatible passive elements, such as interconnects and electrodes, is also central to plastic electronics. For this, ligand-protected metal-cluster films have been shown to anneal at low temperatures below 250∘C to highly conductive metal films, but they suffer from cracking and inadequate substrate adhesion. Here, we report printable metal-cluster–polymer nanocomposites that anneal to a controlled-percolation nanostructure without complete sintering of the metal clusters. This overcomes the previous challenges while still retaining the desired low transformation temperatures. Highly water- and alcohol-soluble gold clusters (75 mg ml−1) were synthesized and homogeneously dispersed into poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) to give a material with annealed d.c. conductivity tuneable between 10−4 and 105 S cm−1. These composites can inject holes efficiently into all-printed polymer organic transistors. The insulator–metal transformation can also be electrically induced at 1 MV cm−1, suggesting possible memory applications."
1378,Unit-cell scale mapping of ferroelectricity and tetragonality in epitaxial ultrathin ferroelectric films,2006-12-17,"Typically, polarization and strain in ferroelectric materials are coupled, leading to the generally accepted direct relation between polarization and unit-cell tetragonality. Here, by means of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy we map, on the unit-cell scale, the degree of tetragonality and the displacements of cations away from the centrosymmetry positions in an ultrathin epitaxial PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 film on a SrRuO3 electrode layer deposited on a SrTiO3 substrate. The lattice is highly tetragonal at the centre of the film, whereas it shows reduced tetragonality close to the interfaces. Most strikingly, we find that the maximum off-centre displacements for the central area of the film do not scale with the tetragonality. This challenges the fundamental belief in a strong polarization–tetragonality coupling in PbTiO3-based ferroelectrics, at such thicknesses. Furthermore, a systematic reduction of the atomic displacements is measured at the interfaces, suggesting that interface-induced suppression of the ferroelectric polarization plays a critical role in the size effect of nanoscale ferroelectrics."
1379,Exchange bias using a spin glass,2006-12-17,"Exchange bias is commonly manifested as the hysteresis-loop shift observed when a ferromagnet is in contact with an antiferromagnet. Here, we report observations of exchange bias with unusual features of a ferromagnet in contact with a spin glass, demonstrating that this is a phenomenon of greater generality. The easily measured properties of the ferromagnet allow access to the internal magnetic degrees of freedom of the glass to which they are coupled. Our results show that a Co/CuMn bilayer system exhibits all the rich phenomena of coercivity enhancement, bias-field shifts and training effects associated with a conventional ferromagnet/antiferromagnet system. Nevertheless, striking differences arise, such as an orientation reversal of the bias field in a small temperature range just below the blocking temperature. We argue that all features can be understood within the context of a random-field model for long-ranged oscillatory Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida (RKKY) coupled spins."
1380,High-performance elastomeric nanocomposites via solvent-exchange processing,2006-12-17,"The incorporation of nanoparticles into engineering thermoplastics affords engineers an opportunity to synthesize polymer nanocomposites that potentially rival the most advanced materials in nature. Development of these materials is difficult because thermodynamic and kinetic barriers inhibit the dispersal of inorganic, often hydrophilic nanoparticles in hydrophobic polymer matrices. Using a new solvent-exchange approach, we preferentially reinforce the hard microdomains of thermoplastic elastomers with smectic clay of similar characteristic dimensions. The strong adhesion between the clay and the hard microdomains coupled with the formation of a percolative network not only stiffens and toughens, but increases the heat distortion temperature of the material and induces reversible thermotropic liquid-crystalline transitions. The discotic clay platelets induce morphological ordering over a range of length scales, which results in significant thermomechanical enhancement and expands high-temperature applications. Merging block-copolymer processing techniques with this method for preferential ordering of nanoparticle facilitates the development of new, hierarchically ordered materials."
1381,The role of vacancies and local distortions in the design of new phase-change materials,2006-12-17,"Phase-change materials are of tremendous technological importance ranging from optical data storage to electronic memories. Despite this interest, many fundamental properties of phase-change materials, such as the role of vacancies, remain poorly understood. ‘GeSbTe’-based phase-change materials contain vacancy concentrations around 10% in their metastable crystalline structure. By using density-functional theory, the origin of these vacancies has been clarified and we show that the most stable crystalline phases with rocksalt-like structures are characterized by large vacancy concentrations and local distortions. The ease by which vacancies are formed is explained by the need to annihilate energetically unfavourable antibonding Ge–Te and Sb–Te interactions in the highest occupied bands. Understanding how the interplay between vacancies and local distortions lowers the total energy helps to design novel phase-change materials as evidenced by new experimental data."
1382,Atomic structure of the binary icosahedral Yb–Cd quasicrystal,2006-12-10,"Icosahedral quasicrystals (i-QCs) are long-range ordered solids that show non-crystallographic symmetries such as five-fold rotations. Their detailed atomic structures are still far from completely understood, because most stable i-QCs form as ternary alloys suffering from chemical disorder. Here, we present the first detailed structure solution of i-YbCd5.7, one of the very few stable binary i-QCs, by means of X-ray structure determination. Three building units with unique atomic decorations arrange quasiperiodically and fill the space. These also serve as building units in the periodic approximant crystals. The structure is not only chemically feasible, but also provides a seamless structural understanding of the i-YbCd5.7 phase and its series of related i-QCs and approximant crystals, revealing hierarchic features that are of considerable physical interest."
1383,Precision control of single-molecule electrical junctions,2006-11-26,"There is much discussion of molecules as components for future electronic devices. However, the contacts, the local environment and the temperature can all affect their electrical properties. This sensitivity, particularly at the single-molecule level, may limit the use of molecules as active electrical components, and therefore it is important to design and evaluate molecular junctions with a robust and stable electrical response over a wide range of junction configurations and temperatures. Here we report an approach to monitor the electrical properties of single-molecule junctions, which involves precise control of the contact spacing and tilt angle of the molecule. Comparison with ab initio transport calculations shows that the tilt-angle dependence of the electrical conductance is a sensitive spectroscopic probe, providing information about the position of the Fermi energy. It is also shown that the electrical properties of flexible molecules are dependent on temperature, whereas those of molecules designed for their rigidity are not."
1384,Shape-engineerable and highly densely packed single-walled carbon nanotubes and their application as super-capacitor electrodes,2006-11-26,"We present a rational and general method to fabricate a high-densely packed and aligned single-walled carbon-nanotube (SWNT) material by using the zipping effect of liquids to draw tubes together. This bulk carbon-nanotube material retains the intrinsic properties of individual SWNTs, such as high surface area, flexibility and electrical conductivity. By controlling the fabrication process, it is possible to fabricate a wide range of solids in numerous shapes and structures. This dense SWNT material is advantageous for numerous applications, and here we demonstrate its use as flexible heaters as well as supercapacitor electrodes for compact energy-storage devices."
1385,Transformation pathways of silica under high pressure,2006-11-05,"Network-forming oxides with rigid polyhedral building blocks often possess significant capacity for densification under pressure owing to their open structures. The high-pressure behaviour of these oxides is key to the mechanical properties of engineering materials and geological processes in the Earth’s interior. Concurrent molecular-dynamics simulations and first-principles calculations reveal that this densification follows a ubiquitous two-stage mechanism. First, a compact high-symmetry anion sublattice forms, as controlled by strong repulsion between the large oxygen anions, and second, cations redistribute onto the newly created interstices. The same mechanism is observed for two different polymorphs of silica, and in the particular case of cristobalite, is corroborated by the experimental finding of a previously unidentified metastable phase. Our simulations not only clarify the nature of this phase, but also identify its occurrence as key evidence in support of this densification mechanism."
1386,Tunable Fröhlich polarons in organic single-crystal transistors,2006-11-05,"In organic field-effect transistors (FETs), charges move near the surface of an organic semiconductor, at the interface with a dielectric. In the past, the nature of the microscopic motion of charge carriers—which determines the device performance—has been related to the quality of the organic semiconductor. Recently, it was discovered that the nearby dielectric also has an unexpectedly strong influence. The mechanisms responsible for this influence are not understood. To investigate these mechanisms, we have studied transport through organic single-crystal FETs with different gate insulators. We find that the temperature dependence of the mobility evolves from metallic-like to insulating-like with increasing dielectric constant of the insulator. The phenomenon is accounted for by a two-dimensional Fröhlich polaron model that quantitatively describes our observations and shows that increasing the dielectric polarizability results in a crossover from the weak to the strong polaronic coupling regime. This represents a considerable step forward in our understanding of transport through organic transistors, and identifies a microscopic physical process with a large influence on device performance."
1387,Lithographically patterned nanowire electrodeposition,2006-10-22,"Nanowire fabrication methods can be classified either as ‘top down’, involving photo- or electron-beam lithography, or ‘bottom up’, involving the synthesis of nanowires from molecular precursors. Lithographically patterned nanowire electrodeposition (LPNE) combines attributes of photolithography with the versatility of bottom-up electrochemical synthesis. Photolithography defines the position of a sacrificial nickel nanoband electrode, which is recessed into a horizontal trench. This trench acts as a ‘nanoform’ to define the thickness of an incipient nanowire during its electrodeposition. The electrodeposition duration determines the width of the nanowire. Removal of the photoresist and nickel exposes a polycrystalline nanowire — composed of gold, platinum or palladium — characterized by thickness and width that can be independently controlled down to 18 and 40 nm, respectively. Metal nanowires prepared by LPNE may have applications in chemical sensing and optical signal processing, and as interconnects in nanoelectronic devices."
1388,A gallium nitride single-photon source operating at 200 K,2006-10-22,"Fundamentally secure quantum cryptography has still not seen widespread application owing to the difficulty of generating single photons on demand. Semiconductor quantum-dot structures have recently shown great promise as practical single-photon sources, and devices with integrated optical cavities and electrical-carrier injection have already been demonstrated. However, a significant obstacle for the application of commonly used III–V quantum dots to quantum-information-processing schemes is the requirement of liquid-helium cryogenic temperatures. Epitaxially grown gallium nitride quantum dots embedded in aluminium nitride have the potential for operation at much higher temperatures. Here, we report triggered single-photon emission from gallium nitride quantum dots at temperatures up to 200 K, a temperature easily reachable with thermo-electric cooling. Gallium nitride quantum dots also open a new wavelength region in the blue and near-ultraviolet portions of the spectrum for single-photon sources."
1389,A predictive mechanism for dynamic strain ageing in aluminium–magnesium alloys,2006-10-22,"Dynamic strain ageing (DSA) is the phenomenon in which solute atoms diffuse around dislocations and retard dislocation motion, leading to negative strain-rate sensitivity (nSRS) and thus to material instabilities during processing, an important issue in commercial metal alloys. Here, we show the mechanism of DSA and nSRS on experimental strain-rate, temperature and stress scales for Al–Mg to be single-atomic-hop motion of solutes from the compression to the tension side of a dislocation core. We derive an analytic expression for the strengthening versus strain rate and temperature that justifies widely used phenomenological forms, provides specific dependences of the parameters on material properties and is supported by atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Using literature material properties, the predicted strengthening quantitatively agrees with the experimentally derived behaviour of Al–2.5% Mg at 300 K, and qualitatively agrees with the strain rate and temperature ranges of DSA and nSRS in Al–Mg alloys. The analyses herein show a clear path for multiscale design, from quantum to continuum mechanics, of solute strengthening in face-centred-cubic metal alloys."
1390,Computational high-throughput screening of electrocatalytic materials for hydrogen evolution,2006-10-15,"The pace of materials discovery for heterogeneous catalysts and electrocatalysts could, in principle, be accelerated by the development of efficient computational screening methods. This would require an integrated approach, where the catalytic activity and stability of new materials are evaluated and where predictions are benchmarked by careful synthesis and experimental tests. In this contribution, we present a density functional theory-based, high-throughput screening scheme that successfully uses these strategies to identify a new electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The activity of over 700 binary surface alloys is evaluated theoretically; the stability of each alloy in electrochemical environments is also estimated. BiPt is found to have a predicted activity comparable to, or even better than, pure Pt, the archetypical HER catalyst. This alloy is synthesized and tested experimentally and shows improved HER performance compared with pure Pt, in agreement with the computational screening results."
1391,High-performance transparent inorganic–organic hybrid thin-film n-type transistors,2006-10-15,"High-performance thin-film transistors (TFTs) that can be fabricated at low temperature and are mechanically flexible, optically transparent and compatible with diverse substrate materials are of great current interest. To function at low biases to minimize power consumption, such devices must also contain a high-mobility semiconductor and/or a high-capacitance gate dielectric. Here we report transparent inorganic–organic hybrid n-type TFTs fabricated at room temperature by combining In2O3 thin films grown by ion-assisted deposition, with nanoscale organic dielectrics self-assembled in a solution-phase process. Such TFTs combine the advantages of a high-mobility transparent inorganic semiconductor with an ultrathin high-capacitance/low-leakage organic gate dielectric. The resulting, completely transparent TFTs exhibit excellent operating characteristics near 1.0 V with large field-effect mobilities of >120 cm2 V−1 s−1, drain–source current on/off modulation ratio (Ion/Ioff)∼105, near-zero threshold voltages and sub-threshold gate voltage swings of 90 mV per decade. The results suggest new strategies for achieving ‘invisible’ optoelectronics."
1392,Effects of hydration on molecular junction transport,2006-10-15,"The study of charge transport through increasingly complex small molecules will benefit from a detailed understanding of how contaminants from the environment affect molecular conduction. This should provide a clearer picture of the electronic characteristics of molecules by eliminating interference from adsorbed species. Here we use magnetically assembled microsphere junctions incorporating thiol monolayers to provide insight into changing electron transport characteristics resulting from exposure to air. Using this technique, current–voltage analysis and inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy (IETS) demonstrate that the primary interaction affecting molecular conduction is rapid hydration at the gold–sulphur contacts. We use IETS to present evidence for changing mechanisms of charge transport as a result of this interaction. The detrimental effects on molecular conduction discussed here are important for understanding electron transport through gold–thiol molecular junctions once exposed to atmospheric conditions."
1393,Magnetic imaging of a supercooling glass transition in a weakly disordered ferromagnet,2006-10-08,"Spin glasses are founded in the frustration and randomness of microscopic magnetic interactions. They are non-ergodic systems where replica symmetry is broken. Although magnetic glassy behaviour has been observed in many colossal magnetoresistive manganites, there is no consensus that they are spin glasses. Here, an intriguing glass transition in (La,Pr,Ca)MnO3 is imaged using a variable-temperature magnetic force microscope. In contrast to the speculated spin-glass picture, our results show that the observed static magnetic configuration seen below the glass-transition temperature arises from the cooperative freezing of the first-order antiferromagnetic (charge ordered) to ferromagnetic transition. Our data also suggest that accommodation strain is important in the kinetics of the phase transition. This cooperative freezing idea has been applied to structural glasses including window glasses and supercooled liquids, and may be applicable across many systems to any first-order phase transition occurring on a complex free-energy landscape."
1394,Shock deformation of face-centred-cubic metals on subnanosecond timescales,2006-09-17,"Despite its fundamental importance for a broad range of applications, little is understood about the behaviour of metals during the initial phase of shock compression. Here, we present molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of shock-wave propagation through a metal allowing a detailed analysis of the dynamics of high strain-rate plasticity. Previous MD simulations have not seen the evolution of the strain from one- to three-dimensional compression that is observed in diffraction experiments. Our large-scale MD simulations of up to 352 million atoms resolve this important discrepancy through a detailed understanding of dislocation flow at high strain rates. The stress relaxes to an approximately hydrostatic state and the dislocation velocity drops to nearly zero. The dislocation velocity drop leads to a steady state with no further relaxation of the lattice, as revealed by simulated X-ray diffraction."
1395,Tunable spin-tunnel contacts to silicon using low-work-function ferromagnets,2006-09-17,"Magnetic tunnel junctions have become ubiquitous components appearing in magnetic random-access memory, read heads of magnetic disk drives and semiconductor-based spin devices. Inserting a tunnel barrier has been key to achieving spin injection from ferromagnetic (FM) metals into GaAs, but spin injection into Si has remained elusive. We show that Schottky barrier formation leads to a huge conductivity mismatch of the FM tunnel contact and Si, which cannot be solved by the well-known method of adjusting the tunnel barrier thickness. We present a radically different approach for spin-tunnelling resistance control using low-work-function ferromagnets, inserted at the FM/tunnel barrier interface. We demonstrate that in this way the resistance–area (RA) product of FM/Al2O3/Si contacts can be tuned over eight orders of magnitude, while simultaneously maintaining a reasonable tunnel spin polarization. This raises prospects for Si-based spintronics and presents a new category of ferromagnetic materials for spin-tunnel contacts in low-RA-product applications."
1396,Observation and tuning of hypersonic bandgaps in colloidal crystals,2006-09-03,"Composite materials with periodic variations of density and/or sound velocities, so-called phononic crystals, can exhibit bandgaps where propagation of acoustic waves is forbidden. Phononic crystals are the elastic analogue of the well-established photonic crystals and show potential for manipulating the flow of elastic energy. So far, the experimental realization of phononic crystals has been restricted to macroscopic systems with sonic or ultrasonic bandgaps in the sub-MHz frequency range. In this work, using high-resolution Brillouin spectroscopy we report the first observation of a hypersonic bandgap in face-centred-cubic colloidal crystals formed by self-assembly of polystyrene nanoparticles with subsequent fluid infiltration. Depending on the particle size and the sound velocity in the infiltrated fluid, the frequency and the width of the gap can be tuned. Promising technological applications of hypersonic crystals, ranging from tunable filters and heat management to acousto-optical devices, are anticipated."
1397,Electrical control of antiferromagnetic domains in multiferroic BiFeO,2006-09-03,"Multiferroic materials, which offer the possibility of manipulating the magnetic state by an electric field or vice versa, are of great current interest. In this work, we demonstrate the first observation of electrical control of antiferromagnetic domain structure in a single-phase multiferroic material at room temperature. High-resolution images of both antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric domain structures of (001)-oriented multiferroic BiFeO3 films revealed a clear domain correlation, indicating a strong coupling between the two types of order. The ferroelectric structure was measured using piezo force microscopy, whereas X-ray photoemission electron microscopy as well as its temperature dependence was used to detect the antiferromagnetic configuration. Antiferromagnetic domain switching induced by ferroelectric polarization switching was observed, in agreement with theoretical predictions."
1398,"Origin of defect-insensitive emission probability in In-containing (Al,In,Ga)N alloy semiconductors",2006-09-03,"Group-III-nitride semiconductors have shown enormous potential as light sources for full-colour displays, optical storage and solid-state lighting. Remarkably, InGaN blue- and green-light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emit brilliant light although the threading dislocation density generated due to lattice mismatch is six orders of magnitude higher than that in conventional LEDs. Here we explain why In-containing (Al,In,Ga)N bulk films exhibit a defect-insensitive emission probability. From the extremely short positron diffusion lengths (<4 nm) and short radiative lifetimes of excitonic emissions, we conclude that localizing valence states associated with atomic condensates of In–N preferentially capture holes, which have a positive charge similar to positrons. The holes form localized excitons to emit the light, although some of the excitons recombine at non-radiative centres. The enterprising use of atomically inhomogeneous crystals is proposed for future innovation in light emitters even when using defective crystals."
1399,Fast fabrication of long-range ordered porous alumina membranes by hard anodization,2006-08-20,"Nanoporous anodic aluminium oxide has been widely used for the development of various functional nanostructures. So far these self-organized pore structures could only be prepared within narrow processing conditions. Here we report a new oxalic-acid-based anodization process for long-range ordered alumina membranes. This process is a new generation of the so-called ‘hard anodization’ approach that has been widely used in industry for high-speed fabrication of mechanically robust, very thick (>100 μm) and low-porosity alumina films since the 1960s. This hard anodization approach establishes a new self-ordering regime with interpore distances, (Dint)=200–300 nm, which have not been achieved by mild anodization processes so far. It offers substantial advantages over conventional anodization processes in terms of processing time, allowing 2,500–3,500% faster oxide growth with improved ordering of the nanopores. Perfectly ordered alumina membranes with high aspect ratios (>1,000) of uniform nanopores with periodically modulated diameters have been realized."
1400,Actin-binding proteins sensitively mediate F-actin bundle stiffness,2006-08-20,"Bundles of filamentous actin (F-actin) form primary structural components of a broad range of cytoskeletal processes including filopodia, sensory hair cell bristles and microvilli. Actin-binding proteins (ABPs) allow the cell to tailor the dimensions and mechanical properties of the bundles to suit specific biological functions. Therefore, it is important to obtain quantitative knowledge on the effect of ABPs on the mechanical properties of F-actin bundles. Here we measure the bending stiffness of F-actin bundles crosslinked by three ABPs that are ubiquitous in eukaryotes. We observe distinct regimes of bundle bending stiffness that differ by orders of magnitude depending on ABP type, concentration and bundle size. The behaviour observed experimentally is reproduced quantitatively by a molecular-based mechanical model in which ABP shearing competes with F-actin extension/compression. Our results shed new light on the biomechanical function of ABPs and demonstrate how single-molecule properties determine mesoscopic behaviour. The bending mechanics of F-actin fibre bundles are general and have implications for cytoskeletal mechanics and for the rational design of functional materials."
1401,Enhanced magnetic field sensitivity of spin-dependent transport in cluster-assembled metallic nanostructures,2006-08-13,"The emerging field of spintronics explores the many possibilities offered by the prospect of using the spin of the electrons for fast, nanosized electronic devices. The effect of magnetization acting on a current is the essence of giant or tunnel magnetoresistance. Although such spintronics effects already find technological applications, much of the underlying physics remains to be explored. The aim of this article is to demonstrate the importance of spin mixing in metallic nanostructures. Here we show that magnetic clusters embedded in a metallic matrix exhibit a giant magnetic response of more than 500% at low temperature, using a recently developed thermoelectric measurement. This method eliminates the dominating resistivity component of the magnetic response and thus reveals an intrinsic spin-dependent process: the conduction-electron spin precession about the exchange field as the electron crosses the clusters, giving rise to a spin-mixing mechanism with strong field dependence. This effect appears sensibly only in the smallest clusters, that is, at the level of less than 100 atoms per cluster."
1402,Time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy of polymer solar cells,2006-08-13,"Blends of conjugated polymers with fullerenes, polymers, or nanocrystals make promising materials for low-cost photovoltaic applications. Different processing conditions affect the efficiencies of these solar cells by creating a variety of nanostructured morphologies, however, the relationship between film structure and device efficiency is not fully understood. We introduce time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) as a means to measure photoexcited charge in polymer films with a resolution of 100 nm and 100 μs. These EFM measurements correlate well with the external quantum efficiencies measured for a series of polymer photodiodes, providing a direct link between local morphology, local optoelectronic properties and device performance. The data show that the domain centres account for the majority of the photoinduced charge collected in polyfluorene blend devices. These results underscore the importance of controlling not only the length scale of phase separation, but also the composition of the domains when optimizing nanostructured solar cells."
1403,Steps on anatase TiO,2006-07-16,"Surface defects strongly influence the surface chemistry of metal oxides, and a detailed picture of defect structures may help to understand reactivity and overall materials performance in many applications. We report first-principles calculations of step edges, the most common intrinsic defects on surfaces (and probably the predominant ones on nanoparticles). We have determined the structure, energetics, and chemistry of step edges on the (101) surface of TiO2 anatase, an important photocatalytic material. Scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements of step-edge configurations and the contrast in atomically resolved images agree remarkably well with the theoretical predictions. Step-edge formation energies as well as the adsorption energies of water scale with the surface energy of the step facet, a trend that is expected to generally hold for metal oxide surfaces. Depending on the terrace/step configuration, this can lead to a situation where a step is less reactive than the flat terrace."
1404, phasing of X-ray powder diffraction patterns by charge flipping,2006-07-09,"Determining crystal structures from powder X-ray diffraction data remains a challenging problem in materials science. By embedding a Le-Bail-like procedure within the recently discovered charge-flipping phasing algorithm, an extremely simple, fast and effective ab initio method has been developed to determine phases directly from indexed powder diffraction patterns. The algorithm solves the degeneracy problem by applying spherical averaging for overlapping Bragg reflections, while solving the phase problem by using the Oszlányi–Sütő charge-flipping algorithm. The processes of peak decomposition and phasing are integrated within the same iteration, and a dynamic support is used. The Fienup hybrid input–output algorithm is also incorporated to minimize stagnation. The ability of the algorithm to find structure-factor phases rapidly is found to assist with the fundamental problem of degeneracy (overlapping reflections) which is intrinsic to powder diffraction data. Space-group and chemical-composition information are not needed as inputs, and can be determined from the result. The method is illustrated using several experimental powder patterns of indifferent quality."
1405,Predicting crystal structure by merging data mining with quantum mechanics,2006-07-09,"Modern methods of quantum mechanics have proved to be effective tools to understand and even predict materials properties. An essential element of the materials design process, relevant to both new materials and the optimization of existing ones, is knowing which crystal structures will form in an alloy system. Crystal structure can only be predicted effectively with quantum mechanics if an algorithm to direct the search through the large space of possible structures is found. We present a new approach to the prediction of structure that rigorously mines correlations embodied within experimental data and uses them to direct quantum mechanical techniques efficiently towards the stable crystal structure of materials."
1406,Orientation selection in dendritic evolution,2006-07-09,"Dendritic crystal growth patterns have fascinated scientists for several centuries. Much of the aesthetic appeal of these patterns stems from the hierarchical structure of primary-, secondary-, and higher-order branches, which typically grow along principal crystallographic axes. Atypical growth directions have also been observed. Here, we demonstrate both computationally and experimentally that the range of possible dendrite growth directions, and hence the morphological diversity of the resulting dendritic structures, is much richer than previously anticipated. In particular, we show that primary dendrite growth directions can vary continuously between different crystallographic directions as a function of the composition-dependent anisotropy parameters. The study combines phase-field simulations of equiaxed dendritic growth and directional freezing of Al–Zn alloys. Both simulations and experiments exhibit continuous changes of direction from 〈100〉 to 〈110〉 for an underlying cubic symmetry. These results have important implications for controlling the microstructure of a wide range of cast alloys that solidify dendritically."
1407,High-Curie-temperature ferromagnetism in self-organized Ge,2006-07-09,"The emerging field of spintronics would be dramatically boosted if room-temperature ferromagnetism could be added to semiconductor nanostructures that are compatible with silicon technology. Here, we report a high-TC (>400K) ferromagnetic phase of (Ge,Mn) epitaxial layer. The manganese content is 6%, and careful structural and chemical analyses show that the Mn distribution is strongly inhomogeneous: we observe eutectoid growth of well-defined Mn-rich nanocolumns surrounded by a Mn-poor matrix. The average diameter of these nanocolumns is 3nm and their spacing is 10nm. Their composition is close to Ge2Mn, which corresponds to an unknown germanium-rich phase, and they have a uniaxially elongated diamond structure. Their Curie temperature is higher than 400K. Magnetotransport reveals a pronounced anomalous Hall effect up to room temperature. A giant positive magnetoresistance is measured from 7,000% at 30K to 200% at 300K and 9T, with no evidence of saturation."
1408,Proteolytic activity monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer through quantum-dot–peptide conjugates,2006-06-25,"Proteases are enzymes that catalyse the breaking of specific peptide bonds in proteins and polypeptides. They are heavily involved in many normal biological processes as well as in diseases, including cancer, stroke and infection. In fact, proteolytic activity is sometimes used as a marker for some cancer types. Here we present luminescent quantum dot (QD) bioconjugates designed to detect proteolytic activity by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. To achieve this, we developed a modular peptide structure which allowed us to attach dye-labelled substrates for the proteases caspase-1, thrombin, collagenase and chymotrypsin to the QD surface. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency within these nanoassemblies is easily controlled, and proteolytic assays were carried out under both excess enzyme and excess substrate conditions. These assays provide quantitative data including enzymatic velocity, Michaelis–Menten kinetic parameters, and mechanisms of enzymatic inhibition. We also screened a number of inhibitory compounds against the QD–thrombin conjugate. This technology is not limited to sensing proteases, but may be amenable to monitoring other enzymatic modifications."
1409,Electronically coupled complementary interfaces between perovskite band insulators,2006-06-18,"Perovskite oxides exhibit a plethora of exceptional properties, providing the basis for novel concepts of oxide-electronic devices. The interest in these materials is even extended by the remarkable characteristics of their interfaces. Studies on single epitaxial connections between the wide-bandgap insulators LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 have revealed them to be either high-mobility electron conductors or insulating, depending on the atomic stacking sequences. For device applications, as well as for a basic understanding of the interface conduction mechanism, it is important to investigate the electronic coupling of closely spaced complementary interfaces. Here we report the successful realization of such coupled interfaces in SrTiO3–LaAlO3 thin-film multilayer structures. We found a critical separation distance of six perovskite unit cell layers, corresponding to approximately 23 Å, below which a decrease of the interface conductivity and carrier density occurs. Interestingly, the high carrier mobilities characterizing the separate conducting interfaces are found to be maintained in coupled structures down to subnanometre interface spacing."
1410,Structural properties of 〈111〉B -oriented III–V nanowires,2006-06-18,"Controlled growth of nanowires is an important, emerging research field with many applications in, for example, electronics, photonics, and life sciences. Nanowires of zinc blende crystal structure, grown in the 〈111〉B direction, which is the favoured direction of growth, usually have a large number of twin-plane defects. Such defects limit the performance of optoelectronic nanowire-based devices. To investigate this defect formation, we examine GaP nanowires grown by metal-organic vapour-phase epitaxy. We show that the nanowire segments between the twin planes are of octahedral shape and are terminated by {111} facets, resulting in a microfaceting of the nanowires. We discuss these findings in a nucleation context, where we present an idea on how the twin planes form. This investigation contributes to the understanding of defect formation in nanowires. One future prospect of such knowledge is to determine strategies on how to control the crystallinity of nanowires."
1411,Magnetic behaviour of layered Ag(,2006-06-18,"Fluoride phases that contain the spin-1/2 4d 9 Ag(II) ion have recently been predicted to have interesting or unusual magnetochemistry, owing to their structural similarity to the 3d 9 Cu(II) cuprates and the covalence associated with this unusual oxidation state of silver. Here we present a comprehensive study of structure and magnetism in the layered Ag(II) fluoride Cs2AgF4, using magnetic susceptometry, inelastic neutron scattering techniques and both X-ray and neutron powder diffraction. We find that this material is well described as a two-dimensional ferromagnet, in sharp contrast to the high-TC cuprates and a previous report in the literature. Analyses of the structural data show that Cs2AgF4 is orbitally ordered at all temperatures of measurement. Therefore, we suggest that orbital ordering may be the origin of the ferromagnetism we observe in this material."
1412,High rate capabilities Fe,2006-06-18,"All battery technologies are known to suffer from kinetic problems linked to the solid-state diffusion of Li in intercalation electrodes, the conductivity of the electrolyte in some cases and the quality of interfaces. For Li-ion technology the latter effect is especially acute when conversion rather than intercalation electrodes are used. Nano-architectured electrodes are usually suggested to enhance kinetics, although their realization is cumbersome. To tackle this issue for the conversion electrode material Fe3O4, we have used a two-step electrode design consisting of the electrochemically assisted template growth of Cu nanorods onto a current collector followed by electrochemical plating of Fe3O4. Using such electrodes, we demonstrate a factor of six improvement in power density over planar electrodes while maintaining the same total discharge time. The capacity at the 8C rate was 80% of the total capacity and was sustained over 100 cycles. The origin of the large hysteresis between charge and discharge, intrinsic to conversion reactions, is discussed and approaches to reduce it are proposed. We hope that such findings will help pave the way for the use of conversion reaction electrodes in future-generation Li-ion batteries."
1413,Complex precipitation pathways in multicomponent alloys,2006-05-21,"One usual way to strengthen a metal is to add alloying elements and to control the size and the density of the precipitates obtained. However, precipitation in multicomponent alloys can take complex pathways depending on the relative diffusivity of solute atoms and on the relative driving forces involved. In Al–Zr–Sc alloys, atomic simulations based on first-principle calculations combined with various complementary experimental approaches working at different scales reveal a strongly inhomogeneous structure of the precipitates: owing to the much faster diffusivity of Sc compared with Zr in the solid solution, and to the absence of Zr and Sc diffusion inside the precipitates, the precipitate core is mostly Sc-rich, whereas the external shell is Zr-rich. This explains previous observations of an enhanced nucleation rate in Al–Zr–Sc alloys compared with binary Al–Sc alloys, along with much higher resistance to Ostwald ripening, two features of the utmost importance in the field of light high-strength materials."
1414,Xenon as a probe for minority sites on solid surfaces,2006-05-21,"Atomic-level microscopies have proved useful to map solid-surface sites directly, but, because of their lack of chemical specificity, they are less adept at identifying unique chemical activity on those sites. Here we present a dual-titration approach developed to probe minority sites on solid surfaces with unique chemical properties of potential relevance to heterogeneous catalysis. Our methodology involves the initial dosing of a chemical probe such as carbon monoxide or ammonia to drive its selective adsorption onto specific sites with particular chemical activity, and the subsequent adsorption of xenon to help identify the nature of those sites. A combination of photoelectron and temperature-programmed desorption spectroscopies are used to characterize the Xe adsorption. The chemistry of oxygen-modified Ni(110) single crystals was probed to test this technique. It was observed that whereas CO does not discriminate among the various sites present on those surfaces, ammonia binds preferentially to the end of –Ni–O rows and modifies their local electrostatic potential. In addition, it was determined that adsorbed CO aids in a reversible surface reconstruction involving the coalescence of fragmented surface –Ni–O rows at high (>350 K) temperatures."
1415,Reversible active switching of the mechanical properties of a peptide film at a fluid–fluid interface,2006-05-21,"Designer peptides have recently been developed as building blocks for novel self-assembled materials with stimuli-responsive properties. To date, such materials have been based on self-assembly in bulk aqueous solution or at solid–fluid interfaces. We have designed a 21-residue peptide, AM1, as a stimuli-responsive surfactant that switches molecular architectures at a fluid–fluid interface in response to changes in bulk aqueous solution composition. In the presence of divalent zinc at neutral pH, the peptide forms a mechanically strong ‘film state’. In the absence of metal ions or at acid pH, the peptide adsorbs to form a mobile ‘detergent state’. The two interfacial states can be actively and reversibly switched. Switching between the two states by a change in pH or the addition of a chelating agent leads to rapid emulsion coalescence or foam collapse. This work introduces a new class of surfactants that offer an environmentally friendly approach to control the stability of interfaces in foams, emulsions and fluid–fluid interfaces more generally."
1416,Robust free-standing nanomembranes of organic/inorganic interpenetrating networks,2006-05-21,"Hybrid sol–gel materials have been a subject of intensive research during the past decades because these nanocomposites combine the versatility of organic polymers with the superior physical properties of glass. Here, we report the synthesis, by spin coating, of hybrid interpenetrating networks in the form of free-standing nanomembrane (around 35-nm thick) with unprecedented macroscopic size and characteristics. The quasi-2D interpenetration of the organic and inorganic networks brings to these materials a unique combination of properties that are not usually compatible within the same film: macroscopic robustness and homogeneity, nanoscale thickness, mechanical strength, high flexibility and optical transparency. Interestingly, such free-standing nanofilms of macroscopic size can seal large openings, are strong enough to hold amounts of liquid 70,000 times heavier than their own weight, and are flexible enough to reversibly pass through holes 30,000 times smaller than their own size."
1417,Spin gap in Tl,2006-05-14,"Dimensionality is one of the most important parameters of physical phenomena. Only two things determine the universality class of a phase transition: the dimensionality of a given system and the symmetry of the order parameter. In most cases, the dimensionality of a substance is predetermined by its crystal structure. Examples in which the effective dimensionality is reduced are quite rare. Here we show that the three-dimensional cubic system of Tl2Ru2O7 most probably evolves into a one-dimensional spin-one Haldane system with a spin gap below 120 K, accompanied by anomalies in the structure, resistivity and susceptibility. We argue that these anomalies are due to an orbital ordering of Ru 4d electrons, with a strong coupling among three degrees of freedom: orbital, spin and lattice. Our work provides a unique example of the spontaneous formation of Haldane system with an insight into the intriguing interplay of different degrees of freedom."
1418,Atomic spin structure of antiferromagnetic domain walls,2006-05-07,"The search for uncompensated magnetic moments on antiferromagnetic surfaces is of great technological importance as they are responsible for the exchange-bias effect that is widely used in state-of-the-art magnetic storage devices. We have studied the atomic spin structure of phase domain walls in the antiferromagnetic Fe monolayer on W(001) by means of spin-polarized scanning tunnelling microscopy and Monte Carlo simulations. The domain wall width only amounts to 6–8 atomic rows. Although walls oriented along 〈100〉 directions are found to be fully compensated, detailed analysis of 〈110〉-oriented walls reveals an uncompensated perpendicular magnetic moment. Our result represents a major advance in the field of antiferromagnetism, and may lead to a better understanding of the magnetic interaction between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials."
1419,Phase separation in superoxygenated La,2006-04-16,"The complex interplay between superconducting and magnetic phases remains poorly understood. Here, we report on the phase separation of doped holes into separate magnetic and superconducting regions in superoxygenated La2−xSrxCuO4+y, with various Sr contents. Irrespective of Sr-doping, excess oxygen raises the superconducting onset to 40 K with a coexisting magnetic spin-density wave that also orders near 40 K in each of our samples. The magnetic region is closely related to the anomalous, 1/8-hole-doped magnetic versions of La2CuO4, whereas the superconducting region is optimally doped. The two phases are probably the only truly stable ground states in this region of the phase diagram. This simple two-component system is a candidate for electronic phase separation in cuprate superconductors, and a key to understanding seemingly conflicting experimental observations."
1420,Mechanistic principles of nanoparticle evolution to zeolite crystals,2006-04-16,"Precursor nanoparticles that form spontaneously on hydrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate in aqueous solutions of tetrapropylammonium (TPA) hydroxide evolve to TPA-silicalite-1, a molecular-sieve crystal that serves as a model for the self-assembly of porous inorganic materials in the presence of organic structure-directing agents. The structure and role of these nanoparticles are of practical significance for the fabrication of hierarchically ordered porous materials and molecular-sieve films, but still remain elusive. Here we show experimental findings of nanoparticle and crystal evolution during room-temperature ageing of the aqueous suspensions that suggest growth by aggregation of nanoparticles. A kinetic mechanism suggests that the precursor nanoparticle population is distributed, and that the 5-nm building units contributing most to aggregation only exist as an intermediate small fraction. The proposed oriented-aggregation mechanism should lead to strategies for isolating or enhancing the concentration of crystal-like nanoparticles."
1421,Photophysics of dopamine-modified quantum dots and effects on biological systems,2006-04-16,"Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been widely used for fluorescent labelling. However, their ability to transfer electrons and holes to biomolecules leads to spectral changes and effects on living systems that have yet to be exploited. Here we report the first cell-based biosensor based on electron transfer between a small molecule (the neurotransmitter dopamine) and CdSe/ZnS QDs. QD–dopamine conjugates label living cells in a redox-sensitive pattern: under reducing conditions, fluorescence is only seen in the cell periphery and lysosomes. As the cell becomes more oxidizing, QD labelling appears in the perinuclear region, including in or on mitochondria. With the most-oxidizing cellular conditions, QD labelling throughout the cell is seen. Phototoxicity results from the creation of singlet oxygen, and can be reduced with antioxidants. This work suggests methods for the creation of phototoxic drugs and for redox-specific fluorescent labelling that are generalizable to any QD conjugated to an electron donor."
1422,"Plasticity, healing and shakedown in sharp-asperity nanoindentation",2006-04-16,"Spatially localized stress fields produced by instrumented, sharp indentation probes are a route to testing the mechanical properties of materials at the smallest length scales. Here we provide direct experimental measurement of indentation plasticity with contact strain fields involving up to a few thousand atoms. We observe two types of nanoscale plasticity: on the pristine surface, high-resolution sensing shows an overall smooth, remarkably reversible indentation response interjected by sudden discrete drops in indenter load. The jumps often occur in pairs with pop-in motion during loading healed by a corresponding pop-out motion on the unload stroke to define a compact hysteresis loop. Despite the general reversibility, cyclic indentation at a single sample position leads to a subtle plastic ratchet and shakedown behaviour with displacements correlated to the underlying gold lattice constant. Our results concur with a previously established picture of thermally activated atomistic plasticity, but suggest a new mechanism at reduced scales that suppresses permanent mass transport."
1423,Ultra-high-density phase-change storage and memory,2006-04-09,"Phase-change storage is widely used in optical information technologies (DVD, CD-ROM and so on), and recently it has also been considered for non-volatile memory applications. This work reports advances in thermal data recording of phase-change materials. Specifically, we show erasable thermal phase-change recording at a storage density of 3.3 Tb inch−2, which is three orders of magnitude denser than that currently achievable with commercial optical storage technologies. We demonstrate the concept of a thin-film nanoheater to realize ultra-small heat spots with dimensions of less than 50 nm. Finally, we show in a proof-of-concept demonstration that an individual thin-film heater can write, erase and read the phase of these storage materials at competitive speeds. This work provides important stepping stones for a very-high-density storage or memory technology based on phase-change materials."
1424,Elastically relaxed free-standing strained-silicon nanomembranes,2006-04-09,"Strain plays a critical role in the properties of materials. In silicon and silicon–germanium, strain provides a mechanism for control of both carrier mobility and band offsets. In materials integration, strain is typically tuned through the use of dislocations and elemental composition. We demonstrate a versatile method to control strain by fabricating membranes in which the final strain state is controlled by elastic strain sharing, that is, without the formation of defects. We grow Si/SiGe layers on a substrate from which they can be released, forming nanomembranes. X-ray-diffraction measurements confirm a final strain predicted by elasticity theory. The effectiveness of elastic strain to alter electronic properties is demonstrated by low-temperature longitudinal Hall-effect measurements on a strained-silicon quantum well before and after release. Elastic strain sharing and film transfer offer an intriguing path towards complex, multiple-layer structures in which each layer’s properties are controlled elastically, without the introduction of undesirable defects."
1425,Local density of states effects at the metal-molecule interfaces in a molecular device,2006-04-02,"Clarifying the nature of interactions between metal electrodes and organic molecules still represent one of the challenging problems in molecular electronics that needs to be solved in order to optimize electron transport through a molecular device. For this purpose, electronic properties at metal–molecule interfaces were studied by combining experimental and theoretical methods. Applying a novel electrochemical approach, strictly two-dimensional Pd islands were prepared on top of 4-mercaptopyridine self-assembled monolayers (4MP-SAMs) which, in turn, were deposited on (111)-oriented Au single crystals. Electron spectroscopy together with density functional theory calculations revealed strong interactions between the molecules and the islands due to Pd–N bonds, resulting in a drastically reduced density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level EF for a nearly closed Pd monolayer, and even non-metallic properties for nanometre-sized islands. Similarly, a significantly reduced DOS at EF was observed for the topmost Au layer at the Au–SAM interface due to Au–S interactions, suggesting that these effects are rather general."
1426,Switching the electrical resistance of individual dislocations in single-crystalline SrTiO,2006-03-26,"The great variability in the electrical properties of multinary oxide materials, ranging from insulating, through semiconducting to metallic behaviour, has given rise to the idea of modulating the electronic properties on a nanometre scale for high-density electronic memory devices. A particularly promising aspect seems to be the ability of perovskites to provide bistable switching of the conductance between non-metallic and metallic behaviour by the application of an appropriate electric field. Here we demonstrate that the switching behaviour is an intrinsic feature of naturally occurring dislocations in single crystals of a prototypical ternary oxide, SrTiO3. The phenomenon is shown to originate from local modulations of the oxygen content and to be related to the self-doping capability of the early transition metal oxides. Our results show that extended defects, such as dislocations, can act as bistable nanowires and hold technological promise for terabit memory devices."
1427,Electronic structure origins of polarity-dependent high-,2006-03-26,"Future spintronics technologies based on diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) will rely heavily on a sound understanding of the microscopic origins of ferromagnetism in such materials. Discoveries of room-temperature ferromagnetism in wide-bandgap DMSs hold great promise, but this ferromagnetism remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate a close link between the electronic structures and polarity-dependent high-TC ferromagnetism of TM2+:ZnO DMSs, where TM2+ denotes 3d transition metal ions. Trends in ferromagnetism across the 3d series of TM2+:ZnO DMSs predicted from the energies of donor- and acceptor-type excited states reproduce experimental trends well. These results provide a unified basis for understanding both n- and p-type ferromagnetic oxide DMSs."
1428,Carrier-controlled ferromagnetism in transparent oxide semiconductors,2006-03-19,"The search for an ideal magnetic semiconductor with tunable ferromagnetic behaviour over a wide range of doping or by electrical gating is being actively pursued as a major step towards realizing spin electronics. A magnetic semiconductor having a high Curie temperature, capable of independently controlled carrier density and magnetic doping, is crucial for developing spin-based multifunctional devices. Cr-doped In2O3 is such a unique system, where the electrical and magnetic behaviour—from ferromagnetic metal-like to ferromagnetic semiconducting to paramagnetic insulator—can be controllably tuned by the defect concentration. An explicit dependence of magnetic interaction leading to ferromagnetism on the carrier density is shown. A carrier-density-dependent high Curie temperature of 850–930 K has been measured, in addition to the observation of clear magnetic domain structures in these films. Being optically transparent with the above optimal properties, Cr-doped In2O3 emerges as a viable candidate for the development of spin electronics."
1429,Liquid-crystalline semiconducting polymers with high charge-carrier mobility,2006-03-19,"Organic semiconductors that can be fabricated by simple processing techniques and possess excellent electrical performance, are key requirements in the progress of organic electronics. Both high semiconductor charge-carrier mobility, optimized through understanding and control of the semiconductor microstructure, and stability of the semiconductor to ambient electrochemical oxidative processes are required. We report on new semiconducting liquid-crystalline thieno[3,2-b ]thiophene polymers, the enhancement in charge-carrier mobility achieved through highly organized morphology from processing in the mesophase, and the effects of exposure to both ambient and low-humidity air on the performance of transistor devices. Relatively large crystalline domain sizes on the length scale of lithographically accessible channel lengths (∼200 nm) were exhibited in thin films, thus offering the potential for fabrication of single-crystal polymer transistors. Good transistor stability under static storage and operation in a low-humidity air environment was demonstrated, with charge-carrier field-effect mobilities of 0.2–0.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 achieved under nitrogen."
1430,Ratchet without spatial asymmetry for controlling the motion of magnetic flux quanta using time-asymmetric drives,2006-03-12,"Initially inspired by biological motors, new types of nanodevice have been proposed for controlling the motion of nanoparticles. Structures incorporating spatially asymmetric potential profiles (ratchet substrates) have been realized experimentally to manipulate vortices in superconductors, particles in asymmetric silicon pores, as well as charged particles through artificial pores and arrays of optical tweezers. Using theoretical ideas, we demonstrate experimentally how to guide flux quanta in layered superconductors using a drive that is asymmetric in time instead of being asymmetric in space. By varying the time-asymmetry of the drive, we are able experimentally to increase or decrease the density of magnetic flux at the centre of superconducting samples that have no spatial ratchet substrate. This is the first ratchet without a ratchet potential. The experimental results can be well described by numerical simulations considering the dragging effect of two types of vortices penetrating layered superconductors in tilted magnetic fields."
1431,Combinatorial search of thermoelastic shape-memory alloys with extremely small hysteresis width,2006-03-05,"Reversibility of structural phase transformations has profound technological implications in a wide range of applications from fatigue life in shape-memory alloys (SMAs) to magnetism in multiferroic oxides. The geometric nonlinear theory of martensite universally applicable to all structural transitions has been developed. It predicts the reversibility of the transitions as manifested in the hysteresis behaviour based solely on crystal symmetry and geometric compatibilities between phases. In this article, we report on the verification of the theory using the high-throughput approach. The thin-film composition-spread technique was devised to rapidly map the lattice parameters and the thermal hysteresis of ternary alloy systems. A clear relationship between the hysteresis and the middle eigenvalue of the transformation stretch tensor as predicted by the theory was observed for the first time. We have also identified a new composition region of titanium-rich SMAs with potential for improved control of SMA properties."
1432,Multiphase imaging of gas flow in a nanoporous material using remote-detection NMR,2006-03-05,"Pore structure and connectivity determine how microstructured materials perform in applications such as catalysis, fluid storage and transport, filtering or as reactors. We report a model study on silica aerogel using a time-of-flight magnetic resonance imaging technique to characterize the flow field and explain the effects of heterogeneities in the pore structure on gas flow and dispersion with 129Xe as the gas-phase sensor. The observed chemical shift allows the separate visualization of unrestricted xenon and xenon confined in the pores of the aerogel. The asymmetrical nature of the dispersion pattern alludes to the existence of a stationary and a flow regime in the aerogel. An exchange time constant is determined to characterize the gas transfer between them. As a general methodology, this technique provides insights into the dynamics of flow in porous media where several phases or chemical species may be present."
1433,Current-induced magnetization reversal in nanopillars with perpendicular anisotropy,2006-02-19,"Devices that show a magnetic anisotropy normal to the film surface hold great promise towards faster and smaller magnetic bits in data-storage applications. We describe an experimental demonstration of current-induced magnetic reversal of nanopillars with perpendicular anisotropy and high coercive fields. The best results are observed for Co/Ni multilayers, which have higher giant magnetoresistance values and spin-torque efficiencies than Co/Pt multilayers. The reference layers were designed to have significantly higher anisotropy allowing a complete current–field phase diagram of the free-layer reversal to be explored. The results are compared to micromagnetic modelling of the free layer that, depending on the bias current and applied field, details regions of irreversible magnetic switching, coherent and incoherent spin waves, or static non-uniform magnetization states. This ability to manipulate high-anisotropy magnetic elements could prove useful for a range of spintronic applications."
1434,Highly oriented crystals at the buried interface in polythiophene thin-film transistors,2006-02-19,"Thin films of polymer semiconductors are being intensively investigated for large-area electronics applications such as light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic cells and thin-film transistors. Understanding the relationship between film morphology and charge transport is key to improving the performance of thin-film transistors. Here we use X-ray diffraction rocking curves to provide direct evidence for highly oriented crystals at the critical buried interface between the polymer and the dielectric where the current flows in thin-film transistors. Treating the substrate surface with self-assembled monolayers significantly varies the concentration of these crystals. We show that the polymer morphology at the buried interface can be different from that in the bulk of the thin films, and provide insight into the processes that limit charge transport in polythiophene films. These results are used to build a more complete model of the relationship between chain packing in polymer thin-films and charge transport."
1435,Spontaneous assembly of viruses on multilayered polymer surfaces,2006-02-19,"The idea that randomly arranged supermolecular species incorporated in a network medium can ultimately create ordered structures at the surface may be counterintuitive. However, such order can be accommodated by regulating dynamic and equilibrium driving forces. Here, we present the ordering of M13 viruses, highly complex biomacromolecules, driven by competitive electrostatic binding, preferential macromolecular interactions and the rigid-rod nature of the virus systems during alternating electrostatic assembly. The steric constraints inherent to the competitive charge binding between M13 viruses and two oppositely charged weak polyelectrolytes leads to interdiffusion and the virtual ‘floating’ of viruses to the surface. The result is the spontaneous formation of a two-dimensional monolayer structure of viruses atop a cohesive polyelectrolyte multilayer. We demonstrate that this viral-assembled monolayer can be a biologically tunable scaffold to nucleate, grow and align nanoparticles or nanowires over multiple length scales. This system represents an interface that provides a general platform for the systematic incorporation and assembly of organic, biological and inorganic materials."
1436,Entropy-driven segregation of nanoparticles to cracks in multilayered composite polymer structures,2006-02-12,"Multilayer composites, which combine ductile polymers with brittle films, constitute vital components for optical communications, microelectronics and bio-engineering applications. However, crack formation is a critical problem in these materials; thus, designing layered systems that can respond to environmental changes and undergo self-healing is particularly important for a range of technologies. Here, nanoparticles dispersed in a polymer matrix were found to migrate to a crack generated at the interface between the polymer and a glassy layer. Segregation of the nanoparticles to the crack depended on both the enthalpic and entropic interactions between the polymer and nanoparticles. In particular, poly(ethylene oxide)-covered 5.2-nm spherical nanoparticles in a poly(methyl methacrylate) matrix diffused to cracks in the adjoining silicon oxide layer, whereas tri-n-octylphosphine oxide-covered nanoparticles did not. These results point to a simple means of fabricating systems that can self-heal, improving the durability of multilayered systems, or form the basis for auto-responsive materials."
1437,Forced crumpling of self-avoiding elastic sheets,2006-02-05,"Thin elastic sheets are important materials across length scales ranging from mesoscopic (polymerized membranes, clay platelets, virus capsids) to macroscopic (paper, metal foils). The crumpling of such sheets by external forces is characterized by the formation of a complex pattern of folds. We have investigated the role of self-avoidance, the fact that the sheets cannot self-intersect, for the crumpling process by large-scale computer simulations. At moderate compression, the force–compression relations of crumpled sheets for both self-avoiding and phantom sheets are found to obey universal power-law behaviours. However, self-avoiding sheets are much stiffer than phantom sheets and, for a given compression, develop many more folds. Moreover, self-avoidance is relevant already at very small volume fractions. The fold-length distribution for crumpled sheets is determined, and is found to be well-described by a log-normal distribution. The stiffening owing to self-avoidance is reflected in the changing nature of the sheet-to-sheet contacts from line-like to two-dimensionally extended with increasing compression."
1438,Tuning the erosion rate of artificial protein hydrogels through control of network topology,2006-01-29,"Erosion behaviour governs the use of physical hydrogels in biomedical applications ranging from controlled release to cell encapsulation. Genetically engineered protein hydrogels offer unique means of controlling the erosion rate by engineering their amino acid sequences and network topology. Here, we show that the erosion rate of such materials can be tuned by harnessing selective molecular recognition, discrete aggregation number and orientational discrimination of coiled-coil protein domains. Hydrogels formed from a triblock artificial protein bearing dissimilar helical coiled-coil end domains (P and A) erode more than one hundredfold slower than hydrogels formed from those bearing the same end domains (either P or A). The reduced erosion rate is a consequence of the fact that looped chains are suppressed because P and A tend not to associate with each other. Thus, the erosion rate can be tuned over several orders of magnitude in artificial protein hydrogels, opening the door to diverse biomedical applications."
1439,Why some interfaces cannot be sharp,2006-01-22,"A central goal of modern materials physics and nanoscience is the control of materials and their interfaces to atomic dimensions. For interfaces between polar and nonpolar layers, this goal is thwarted by a polar catastrophe that forces an interfacial reconstruction. In traditional semiconductors, this reconstruction is achieved by an atomic disordering and stoichiometry change at the interface, but a new option is available in multivalent oxides: if the electrons can move, the atoms do not have to. Using atomic-scale electron energy loss spectroscopy, we have examined the microscopic distribution of charge and ions across the (001) LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. We find that there is a fundamental asymmetry between the ionically compensated AlO2/SrO/TiO2 interface, and the electronically compensated AlO2/LaO/TiO2 interface, both in interfacial sharpness and charge density. This suggests a general strategy to design sharp interfaces, remove interfacial screening charges, control the band offset and, hence, markedly improve the performance of oxide devices."
1440,"Self-organization in phase separation of a lyotropic liquid crystal into cellular, network and droplet morphologies",2006-01-22,"Phase separation is one of the most fundamental physical phenomena that controls the morphology of heterogeneous structures. Phase separation of a binary mixture of simple liquids produces only two morphologies: a bicontinuous or a droplet structure in the case of a symmetric or an asymmetric composition, respectively. For complex fluids, there is a possibility to produce other interesting morphologies. We found that a network structure of the minority phase can also be induced transiently on phase separation if the dynamics of the minority phase are much slower than those of the majority phase. Here we induce a cellular structure of the minority phase intentionally with the help of its smectic ordering, using phase separation of a lyotropic liquid crystal into the isotropic and smectic phase. We can control the three morphologies, cellular, network and droplet structures, solely by changing the heating rate. We demonstrate that the kinetic interplay between phase separation and smectic ordering is a key to the morphological selection. This may provide a new route to the formation of network and cellular morphologies in soft materials."
1441,Electric-field-induced redistribution of polar nano-regions in a relaxor ferroelectric,2006-01-15,"Relaxor ferroelectrics, with their strong dependence of polarization on the applied electric field, are of considerable technological importance. On a microscopic scale, however, there exists competition as well as coexistence between short-range and long-range polar order. The conventional picture is that the polar nano-regions (PNRs) that appear at high temperatures beyond the Curie transition, form nuclei for the field-induced long-range order at low temperatures. Here, we report high-energy X-ray diffuse-scattering measurements on the relaxor Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3 (PZN) to study the short-range polar order under an electric field applied along the [111] direction. In contrast to conventional expectations, the overall diffuse-scattering intensity is not suppressed. On the other hand, the field induces a marked change on the shape of the three-dimensional diffuse-scattering intensity pattern, corresponding to a redistribution of PNRs in real space. We show that these surprising results are consistent with a model in which the PNRs with [110]-type polarizations, orthogonal to that of the surrounding environment, are embedded and persist in the [111]-polarized ferroelectric order of the bulk."
1442,Tuning the magnetic coupling across ultrathin antiferromagnetic films by controlling atomic-scale roughness,2006-01-08,"Characterization and control of the interface structure and morphology at the atomic level is an important issue in understanding the magnetic interaction between an antiferromagnetic material and an adjacent ferromagnet in detail, because the atomic spins in an antiferromagnet change direction on the length scale of nearest atomic distances. Despite its technological importance for the development of advanced magnetic data-storage devices and extensive studies, the details of the magnetic interface coupling between antiferromagnets and ferromagnets have remained concealed. Here we present the results of magneto-optical Kerr-effect measurements and layer-resolved spectro-microscopic magnetic domain imaging of single-crystalline ferromagnet–antiferromagnet– ferromagnet trilayers. Atomic-level control of the interface morphology is achieved by systematically varying the thicknesses of the bottom ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic layer. We find that the magnetic coupling across the interface is mediated by step edges of single-atom height, whereas atomically flat areas do not contribute."
1443,How single conjugated polymer molecules respond to electric fields,2006-01-08,"Conjugated polymers find applications in a range of devices such as light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors and solar cells. The elementary electronic response of these semiconductors to electric fields is understood in terms of nanoscale perturbations of charge density. We demonstrate a general breaking of spatial charge symmetry by considering the linear Stark effect in the emission of single chromophores on individual chains. Spectral shifts of several nanometres occur due to effective dipoles exceeding 10 D. Although the electric field does not ionize the exciton, some molecules exhibit field-induced intensity modulations. This quenching illustrates the equivalence of charge symmetry breaking and polaron-pair or charge-transfer-state formation, and provides a microscopic picture of permanent charging, which leads to doping and exciton dissociation in actual devices. In addition to using this tuneable emission in single-photon electro-optic modulators, hysteresis in the Stark shift suggests a route to designing nanoscale memory elements such as molecular switches."
1444,Computing the mobility of grain boundaries,2006-01-08,"As current experimental and simulation methods cannot determine the mobility of flat boundaries across the large misorientation phase space, we have developed a computational method for imposing an artificial driving force on boundaries. In a molecular dynamics simulation, this allows us to go beyond the inherent timescale restrictions of the technique and induce non-negligible motion in flat boundaries of arbitrary misorientation. For different series of symmetric boundaries, we find both expected and unexpected results. In general, mobility increases as the grain boundary plane deviates from (111), but high-coincidence and low-angle boundaries represent special cases. These results agree with and enrich experimental observations."
1445,Spatial control of the recombination zone in an ambipolar light-emitting organic transistor,2005-12-18,"Organic semiconductors show efficient electroluminescence which has led to their commercialization in light-emitting diodes, but has also raised fundamental questions about their recombination and emission physics. Organic ambipolar field-effect transistors can support both hole and electron transport at the semiconductor–dielectric interface. Using their ability to emit light owing to charge recombination within the transistor channel should enable new ways to study the recombination physics and realize new electrooptical devices. Here we demonstrate ambipolar light-emitting transistors based on a semiconducting polymer with both efficient electron and hole transport and good photoluminescence efficiency. In our device configuration, electrons and holes injected from separate calcium and gold electrodes recombine radiatively within the channel. We can move the recombination zone with the applied gate and source–drain bias to any position within the channel. This provides a direct visualization and proof of coexisting electron and hole accumulation layers in an ambipolar transport regime."
1446,Unravelling the interplay of local structure and physical properties in phase-change materials,2005-12-11,"As the chemical bonds in a covalent semiconductor are independent of long-range order, semiconductors generally have similar local arrangements not only in the crystalline, but also in the amorphous phase. In contrast, the compound Ge2Sb2Te5, which is a prototype phase-change material used in optical and electronic data storage, has been shown to undergo a profound change in local order on amorphization. In this work, ab initio ground state calculations are used to unravel the origin of the local order in the crystalline cubic and the amorphous phase of GeSbTe alloys and the resulting physical properties. Our study shows that this class of materials is characterized by two competing structures with similar energy but different local order and different physical properties. We explain both the local distortions found in the crystalline phase and the occurrence of octahedral and tetrahedral coordination in the amorphous state. Although the atomic rearrangement is most pronounced for the Ge atoms, the strongest change of the electronic states affects the Te states close to the Fermi energy, resulting in a pronounced change of electronic properties such as an increased energy gap."
1447,Metal-free silicon–molecule–nanotube testbed and memory device,2005-12-04,"Work from several laboratories has shown that metal nanofilaments cause problems in some molecular electronics testbeds. A new testbed for exploring the electrical properties of single molecules has been developed to eliminate the possibility of metal nanofilament formation and to ensure that molecular effects are measured. This metal-free system uses single-crystal silicon and single-walled carbon nanotubes as electrodes for the molecular monolayer. A direct Si–arylcarbon grafting method is used. Use of this structure with π-conjugated organic molecules resulted in a hysteresis loop with current–voltage measurements that are useful for an electronic memory device. The memory is non-volatile for more than 3 days, non-destructive for more than 1,000 reading operations and capable of more than 1,000 write–erase cycles before device breakdown. Devices without π-conjugated molecules (Si–H surface only) or with long-chain alkyl-bearing molecules produced no hysteresis, indicating that the observed memory effect is molecularly relevant."
1448,Diffractive electron imaging of nanoparticles on a substrate,2005-11-20,"There is a retraction (October 2006) associated with this Article. Please click here to view.  The observation of the detailed atomic arrangement within nanostructures has previously required the use of an electron microscope for imaging. The development of diffractive (lensless) imaging in X-ray science and electron microscopy using ab initio phase retrieval provides a promising tool for nanostructural characterization. We show that it is possible experimentally to reconstruct the atomic-resolution complex image (exit-face wavefunction) of a small particle lying on a thin carbon substrate from its electron microdiffraction pattern alone. We use a modified iterative charge-flipping algorithm and an estimate of the complex substrate image is subtracted at each iteration. The diffraction pattern is recorded using a parallel beam with a diameter of ∼50 nm, illuminating a gold nanoparticle of ∼13.6 nm diameter. Prior knowledge of the boundary of the object is not required. The method has the advantage that the reconstructed exit-face wavefunction is free of the aberrations of the objective lens normally used in the microscope, whereas resolution is limited only by thermal vibration and noise."
1449,Light-induced gene transfer from packaged DNA enveloped in a dendrimeric photosensitizer,2005-11-20,"The control of gene transfection in the body is a core issue in gene therapy. Photochemical internalization is a technology that allows light-induced delivery of DNA, drugs or other biological factors directly inside cells. Usually it requires that a photosensitizer be added to the drug-delivery system to photochemically destabilize the endosomal membrane. Here we present a system for in vivo DNA delivery in which these two components are assembled into one structure. This is a ternary complex composed of a core containing DNA packaged with cationic peptides and enveloped in the anionic dendrimer phthalocyanine, which provides the photosensitizing action. The ternary complex showed more than 100-fold photochemical enhancement of transgene expression in vitro with reduced photocytotoxicity. In an animal experiment, subconjuctival injection of the ternary complex followed by laser irradiation resulted in transgene expression only in the laser-irradiated site. This work demonstrates a new biomedical application for dendrimers, and the first success in the photochemical-internalization-mediated gene delivery in vivo."
1450,Morphology-tuned wurtzite-type ZnS nanobelts,2005-11-13,"Nanometre-sized inorganic dots, wires and belts have a wide range of electrical and optical properties, and variable mechanical stability and phase-transition mechanisms that show a sensitive dependency on size, shape and structure. The optical properties of the semiconductor ZnS in wurtzite structures are considerably enhanced, but the lack of structural stability limits technological applications. Here, we demonstrate that morphology-tuned wurtzite ZnS nanobelts show a particular low-energy surface structure dominated by the  surface facets. Experiments and calculations show that the morphology of ZnS nanobelts leads to a very high mechanical stability to ∼6.8 GPa, and also results in an explosive mechanism for the wurtzite-to-sphalerite phase transformation together with in situ fracture of the nanobelts. ZnS wurtzite nanobelts provide a model that is useful not only for understanding the morphology-tuned stability and transformation mechanism, but also for improving synthesis of metastable nanobelts with quantum effects for electronic and optical devices."
1451,Anharmonic motions of Kr in the clathrate hydrate,2005-11-06,"The anomalous glass-like thermal conductivity of crystalline clathrates has been suggested to be the result of the scattering of thermal phonons of the framework by ‘rattling’ motions of the guests in the clathrate cages. Using the site-specific 83Kr nuclear resonant inelastic scattering spectroscopy in combination with conventional incoherent inelastic neutron scattering and molecular-dynamics simulations, we provide unambiguous evidence and characterization of the effects on these guest–host interactions in a structure-II Kr clathrate hydrate. The resonant scattering of phonons led to unprecedented large anharmonic motions of the guest atoms. The anharmonic interaction underlies the anomalous thermal transport in this system. Clathrates are prototypical models for a class of crystalline framework materials with glass-like thermal conductivity. The explanation of the unusual molecular dynamics has a wide implication for the understanding of the thermal properties of disordered solids and structural glasses."
1452,Identifying and counting point defects in carbon nanotubes,2005-11-06,"The prevailing conception of carbon nanotubes and particularly single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) continues to be one of perfectly crystalline wires. Here, we demonstrate a selective electrochemical method that labels point defects and makes them easily visible for quantitative analysis. High-quality SWNTs are confirmed to contain one defect per 4 μm on average, with a distribution weighted towards areas of SWNT curvature. Although this defect density compares favourably to high-quality, silicon single-crystals, the presence of a single defect can have tremendous electronic effects in one-dimensional conductors such as SWNTs. We demonstrate a one-to-one correspondence between chemically active point defects and sites of local electronic sensitivity in SWNT circuits, confirming the expectation that individual defects may be critical to understanding and controlling variability, noise and chemical sensitivity in SWNT electronic devices. By varying the SWNT synthesis technique, we further show that the defect spacing can be varied over orders of magnitude. The ability to detect and analyse point defects, especially at very low concentrations, indicates the promise of this technique for quantitative process analysis, especially in nanoelectronics development."
1453,Probing of bonding changes in B,2005-10-23,"Full understanding of atomic arrangement in amorphous oxides both at ambient and high pressure is an ongoing fundamental puzzle. Whereas the structures of archetypal oxide glasses such as v-B2O3 at high pressure are essential to elucidate origins of anomalous macroscopic properties of more complex melts, knowledge of the high-pressure structure and pressure-induced coordination changes of these glasses has remained elusive due to lack of suitable in situ experimental probes. Here, we report synchrotron inelastic X-ray scattering results for v-B2O3 at pressures up to 22.5 GPa, revealing the nature of pressure-induced bonding changes and the structure. Direct in situ measurements show a continuous transformation from tri-coordinated to tetra-coordinated boron beginning at 4–7 GPa with most of the boron tetra-coordinated above 20 GPa, forming dense tetrahedral v-B2O3. After decompression from high pressure the bonding reverts back to tri-coordinated boron but with the data suggesting a permanent densification."
1454,Electronic structure and exchange coupling of Mn impurities in III–V semiconductors,2005-10-23,"Dilute magnetic semiconductors are without doubt among the most interesting classes of magnetic materials. However, the nature of their electronic structure and magnetic exchange is far from understood, and important discrepancies exist between widely used phenomenological models and first-principles electronic-structure descriptions. Here we apply the ab initio self-interaction-corrected local-spin-density method to study the electronic structure of Mn-doped III–V semiconductors. For (GaMn)As, our results with the (d5+h) configuration agree with the Zener model description and predict p–d exchange that is in good agreement with experiment. The ground state in (GaMn)N and (GaMn)P is the d4 configuration with no intrinsic carriers. If, however, holes are introduced extrinsically, carrier-mediated exchange is possible, but the p–d exchange is predicted to be lower in p-type GaN, as compared with GaP and GaAs. Nevertheless, because of the smaller lattice constant, the estimated Curie temperature is higher than in (GaMn)As, at comparable doping levels."
1455,Nanoparticle networks reduce the flammability of polymer nanocomposites,2005-10-23,"Synthetic polymeric materials are rapidly replacing more traditional inorganic materials, such as metals, and natural polymeric materials, such as wood. As these synthetic materials are flammable, they require modifications to decrease their flammability through the addition of flame-retardant compounds. Environmental regulation has restricted the use of some halogenated flame-retardant additives, initiating a search for alternative flame-retardant additives. Nanoparticle fillers are highly attractive for this purpose, because they can simultaneously improve both the physical and flammability properties of the polymer nanocomposite. We show that carbon nanotubes can surpass nanoclays as effective flame-retardant additives if they form a jammed network structure in the polymer matrix, such that the material as a whole behaves rheologically like a gel. We find this kind of network formation for a variety of highly extended carbon-based nanoparticles: single- and multiwalled nanotubes, as well as carbon nanofibres."
1456,The quantum spin-valve in cobalt atomic point contacts,2005-10-23,"Magnetic materials reduced to a single atom show unexpected magnetic properties that interact with the spin states of the transmitting electrons and modify the nature of the quantized conductance. This integration of quantized conductance and spin-dependent transport across a magnetic atom gives rise to a multichannel system across which the transmission of electron waves can be regulated by a domain wall acting as a ‘valve’ —a quantum spin-valve. Here we measure complete magnetoresistance loops across magnetic quantum point contacts as small as a single atom, using cobalt. ‘Discrete’ or quantum magnetoresistance loops are observed owing to the varying transmission probability from the available discrete conductance channels. A remarkable feature of these quantum contacts is the discovery of a rapid oscillatory decay in magnetoresistance with increasing contact size. The results provide an evolutionary trace of spin-dependent transport from a single atom to larger ensembles."
1457,The evolution of vesicles from bulk lamellar gels,2005-10-16,"The remarkable ability of phospholipids to generate vesicles and lamellar morphologies has been mimicked by amphiphilic block copolymers and both classes of amphiphiles have been extensively studied in bulk and in dilute solution. The most common vesicle preparation method involves diffusion of water into a lamellar gel. The transformation proceeds from a collection of water-poor planar lamellae, to a water-rich interconnected layer-phase and then a collection of closed lamellae (vesicles) that form a close-packed gel. This is demonstrated by scattering and microscopy with the evolution of the gel structure being driven by increasing curvature. Vesicles have been observed to form when the copolymer–water system still has long-range order, with a discrete, clustered-vesicle structure leading to a turbid dispersion. Eventually, at very low concentration, the packed vesicles separate, generating very stable isotropic dispersions that are transparent. This phase sequence, involving a dispersion of close-packed vesicles, accounts for the formation of a narrow size distribution in these systems."
1458,Formation of asymmetric one-sided metal-tipped semiconductor nanocrystal dots and rods,2005-10-16,"Multicomponent nanoparticles represent a new approach for creating smart materials, requiring the development of the growth of different material types on one particle. Here, we report the synthesis of asymmetric metal–semiconductor heterostructures where gold is grown on one side of CdSe nanocrystal quantum rods and dots, creating nanostructures offering intrinsic asymmetry for diverse device functionalities such as diode elements, along with one-sided chemical accessibility through the gold tips. Surprisingly, one-sided growth is preceded by two-sided growth and is generally observed in different particle shapes. Theoretical modelling in a lattice-gas model and experimental analysis show that a ripening process drives gold from one end to the other, transforming two-sided growth to one-sided growth. Ripening is therefore occurring on the nanostructure itself, leading to a phase-segregated structure. This thereby extends the realm of ripening phenomena and their significance in nanostructure synthesis, in particular for nanocrystals composed of different materials."
1459,High-efficiency solution processable polymer photovoltaic cells by self-organization of polymer blends,2005-10-09,"Converting solar energy into electricity provides a much-needed solution to the energy crisis the world is facing today. Polymer solar cells have shown potential to harness solar energy in a cost-effective way. Significant efforts are underway to improve their efficiency to the level of practical applications. Here, we report highly efficient polymer solar cells based on a bulk heterojunction of polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) and methanofullerene. Controlling the active layer growth rate results in an increased hole mobility and balanced charge transport. Together with increased absorption in the active layer, this results in much-improved device performance, particularly in external quantum efficiency. The power-conversion efficiency of 4.4% achieved here is the highest published so far for polymer-based solar cells. The solution process involved ensures that the fabrication cost remains low and the processing is simple. The high efficiency achieved in this work brings these devices one step closer to commercialization."
1460,Flux crystal growth and thermal stabilities of LiV,2005-10-09,"The spinel oxide LiV2O4 is a interesting compound that shows heavy fermion behaviour despite its d-electron system. The large quasiparticle specific heat coefficient (γ value) is close to those of other heavy fermion systems in f-electron Zintl compounds. The mechanism of such heavy fermion behaviour in LiV2O4 has not been resolved, owing to the lack of high-quality single crystals required for experiments. Here we present a crystal-growth technique for LiV2O4 using a solvent system that acts effectively for mixed-valence vanadium (V3+ and V4+) oxides. The grown crystals have a well-developed octahedral form bounded by {111} faces, with high crystallographic quality and maximum size of almost 1.0×1.0×1.0 mm. The crystals have stoichiometric composition and show heavy fermion behaviour with an extremely large γ value of ∼460 mJ mol−1 K−2. Crystals of LiV2O4 are very sensitive to air and moisture, but are stable up to 1,020 ∘C under vacuum."
1461,Aligned two- and three-dimensional structures by directional freezing of polymers and nanoparticles,2005-09-25,"The preparation of materials with aligned porosity in the micrometre range is of technological importance for a wide range of applications in organic electronics, microfluidics, molecular filtration and biomaterials. Here, we demonstrate a generic method for the preparation of aligned materials using polymers, nanoparticles or mixtures of these components as building blocks. Directional freezing is used to align the structural elements, either in the form of three-dimensional porous structures or as two-dimensional oriented surface patterns. This simple technique can be used to generate a diverse array of complex structures such as polymer–inorganic nanocomposites, aligned gold microwires and microwire networks, porous composite microfibres and biaxially aligned composite networks. The process does not involve any chemical reaction, thus avoiding potential complications associated with by-products or purification procedures."
1462,Domain switching in polycrystalline ferroelectric ceramics,2005-09-18,"Ferroelectric ceramics are widely used as sensors and actuators for their electro-mechanical properties, and in electronic applications for their dielectric properties. Domain switching – the phenomenon wherein the ferroelectric material changes from one spontaneously polarized state to another under electrical or mechanical loads – is an important attribute of these materials. However, this is a complex collective process in commercially used polycrystalline ceramics that are agglomerations of a very large number of variously oriented grains. As the domains in one grain attempt to switch, they are constrained by the differently oriented neighbouring grains. Here we use a combined theoretical and experimental approach to establish a relation between crystallographic symmetry and the ability of a ferroelectric polycrystalline ceramic to switch. In particular, we show that equiaxed polycrystals of materials that are either tetragonal or rhombohedral cannot switch; yet polycrystals of materials where these two symmetries co-exist can in fact switch."
1463,An interfacial instability in a transient wetting layer leads to lateral phase separation in thin spin-cast polymer-blend films,2005-09-04,"Spin-coating is a very widely used technique for making uniform thin polymer films. For example, the active layers in most experimental semiconducting polymer-based devices, such as light-emitting diodes and photovoltaics, are made this way. The efficiency of such devices can be improved by using blends of polymers; these phase separate during the spin-coating process, creating the complex morphology that leads to performance improvements. We have used time-resolved small-angle light scattering and light reflectivity during the spin-coating process to study the development of structure directly. Our results provide evidence that a blend of two polymers first undergoes vertical stratification; the interface between the stratified layers then becomes unstable, leading to the final phase-separated thin film. This has given us the basis for establishing a full mechanistic understanding of the development of morphology in thin mixed polymer films, allowing a route to the rational design of processing conditions so as to achieve desirable morphologies by self-assembly."
1464,Macroscopic transport by synthetic molecular machines,2005-08-28,"Nature uses molecular motors and machines in virtually every significant biological process, but demonstrating that simpler artificial structures operating through the same gross mechanisms can be interfaced with—and perform physical tasks in—the macroscopic world represents a significant hurdle for molecular nanotechnology. Here we describe a wholly synthetic molecular system that converts an external energy source (light) into biased brownian motion to transport a macroscopic cargo and do measurable work. The millimetre-scale directional transport of a liquid on a surface is achieved by using the biased brownian motion of stimuli-responsive rotaxanes (‘molecular shuttles’) to expose or conceal fluoroalkane residues and thereby modify surface tension. The collective operation of a monolayer of the molecular shuttles is sufficient to power the movement of a microlitre droplet of diiodomethane up a twelve-degree incline."
1465,From anisotropic photo-fluidity towards nanomanipulation in the optical near-field,2005-08-21,"An increase in random molecular vibrations of a solid owing to heating above the melting point leads to a decrease in its long-range order and a loss of structural symmetry. Therefore conventional liquids are isotropic media. Here we report on a light-induced isothermal transition of a polymer film from an isotropic solid to an anisotropic liquid state in which the degree of mechanical anisotropy can be controlled by light. Whereas during irradiation by circular polarized light the film behaves as an isotropic viscoelastic fluid, it shows considerable fluidity only in the direction parallel to the light field vector under linear polarized light. The fluidization phenomenon is related to photoinduced motion of azobenzene-functionalized molecular units, which can be effectively activated only when their transition dipole moments are oriented close to the direction of the light polarization. We also describe here how the photofluidization allows nanoscopic elements of matter to be precisely manipulated."
1466,X-ray-diffraction characterization of Pt(111) surface nanopatterning induced by C,2005-08-21,"Understanding the adsorption mechanisms of large molecules on metal surfaces is a demanding task. Theoretical predictions are difficult because of the large number of atoms that have to be considered in the calculations, and experiments aiming to solve the molecule–substrate interaction geometry are almost impossible with standard laboratory techniques. Here, we show that the adsorption of complex organic molecules can induce perfectly ordered nanostructuring of metal surfaces. We use surface X-ray diffraction to investigate in detail the bonding geometry of C60 with the Pt(111) surface, and to elucidate the interaction mechanism leading to the restructuring of the Pt(111) surface. The chemical interaction between one monolayer of C60 molecules and the clean Pt(111) surface results in the formation of an ordered  reconstruction based on the creation of a surface vacancy lattice. The C60 molecules are located on top of the vacancies, and 12 covalent bonds are formed between the carbon atoms and the 6 platinum surface atoms around the vacancies. In-plane displacements induced on the platinum substrate are of the order of a few picometres in the top layer, and are undetectable in the deeper layers."
1467,Quantitative equivalence between polymer nanocomposites and thin polymer films,2005-08-07,"The thermomechanical responses of polymers, which provide limitations to their practical use, are favourably altered by the addition of trace amounts of a nanofiller. However, the resulting changes in polymer properties are poorly understood, primarily due to the non-uniform spatial distribution of nanoparticles. Here we show that the thermomechanical properties of ‘polymer nanocomposites’ are quantitatively equivalent to the well-documented case of planar polymer films. We quantify this equivalence by drawing a direct analogy between film thickness and an appropriate experimental interparticle spacing. We show that the changes in glass-transition temperature with decreasing interparticle spacing for two filler surface treatments are quantitatively equivalent to the corresponding thin-film data with a non-wetting and a wetting polymer–particle interface. Our results offer new insights into the role of confinement on the glass transition, and we conclude that the mere presence of regions of modified mobility in the vicinity of the particle surfaces, that is, a simple two-layer model, is insufficient to explain our results. Rather, we conjecture that the glass-transition process requires that the interphase regions surrounding different particles interact."
1468,Heterogeneity in polymer melts from melting of polymer crystals,2005-07-24,"Semi-crystalline polymers containing amorphous and crystalline regions usually have intimately mixed chains. The resulting topological constraints (entanglements) in the amorphous regions limit the drawability in the solid state. By controlled synthesis the number of entanglements can be reduced. Ultimately, crystals composed of single chains are feasible, where the chains are fully separated from each other. If such separation can be maintained in the melt a new melt state can be formed. Here we show that through slow and carefully controlled melting such polymer crystals form a heterogeneous melt with more entangled regions, where the chains are mixed, and less entangled ones, composed of individually separated chains. Chain reptation, required for the homogenization of the entanglement distribution, is found to be considerably hindered. The long-lived heterogeneous melt shows decreased melt viscosity and provides enhanced drawability on crystallization. This novel route to create heterogeneous melt should be applicable to polymers in general."
1469,Multipurpose microfluidic probe,2005-07-24,"Microfluidic systems allow (bio)chemical processes to be miniaturized with the benefit of shorter time-to-result, parallelism, reduced sample consumption, laminar flow, and increased control and efficiency. However, such miniaturization inherently limits the size of the solid objects that can be processed and entails new challenges such as the interfacing of macroscopic samples with microscopic conduits. Here, we report a microfluidic probe (MFP) that overcomes these problems by combining the concepts of ‘microfluidics’ and of ‘scanning probes’. Here, liquid boundaries formed by hydrodynamic forces underneath the MFP confine a flow of processing solution and replace the solid walls of closed microchannels. The MFP is therefore mobile and can be used to process large surfaces and objects by scanning across them. We illustrate the versatility of this concept with several examples including protein microarraying, complex gradient-formation, multiphase laminar-flow patterning, erasing, localized staining of cells and the contact-free detachment of a single cell. Many constraints imposed by the monolithic construction of microfluidic channels can now be circumvented using an MFP, opening up new avenues for microfluidic processing."
1470,The role of van der Waals forces in adhesion of micromachined surfaces,2005-07-17,"Interfacial adhesion and friction are important factors in determining the performance and reliability of microelectro- mechanical systems. We demonstrate that the adhesion of micromachined surfaces is in a regime not considered by standard rough surface adhesion models. At small roughness values, our experiments and models show unambiguously that the adhesion is mainly due to van der Waals dispersion forces acting across extensive non-contacting areas and that it is related to 1/Dave2, where Dave is the average surface separation. These contributions must be considered because of the close proximity of the surfaces, which is a result of the planar deposition technology. At large roughness values, van der Waals forces at contacting asperities become the dominating contributor to the adhesion. In this regime our model calculations converge with standard models in which the real contact area determines the adhesion. We further suggest that topographic correlations between the upper and lower surfaces must be considered to understand adhesion completely."
1471,Quantitative insight into dislocation nucleation from high-temperature nanoindentation experiments,2005-07-17,"Nanoindentation has become ubiquitous for the measurement of mechanical properties at ever-decreasing scales of interest, including some studies that have explored the atomic-level origins of plasticity in perfect crystals. With substantial guidance from atomistic simulations, the onset of plasticity during nanoindentation is now widely believed to be associated with homogeneous dislocation nucleation. However, to date there has been no compelling quantitative experimental support for the atomic-scale mechanisms predicted by atomistic simulations. Our purpose here is to significantly advance the quantitative potential of nanoindentation experiments for the study of dislocation nucleation. This is accomplished through the development and application of high-temperature nanoindentation testing, and the introduction of statistical methods to quantitatively evaluate data. The combined use of these techniques suggests an unexpected picture of incipient plasticity that involves heterogeneous nucleation sites, and which has not been anticipated by atomistic simulations."
1472,A modular and supramolecular approach to bioactive scaffolds for tissue engineering,2005-06-19,"Bioactive polymeric scaffolds are a prerequisite for the ultimate formation of functional tissues. Here, we show that supramolecular polymers based on quadruple hydrogen bonding ureido-pyrimidinone (UPy) moieties are eminently suitable for producing such bioactive materials owing to their low-temperature processability, favourable degradation and biocompatible behaviour. Particularly, the reversible nature of the hydrogen bonds allows for a modular approach to gaining control over cellular behaviour and activity both in vitro and in vivo. Bioactive materials are obtained by simply mixing UPy-functionalized polymers with UPy-modified biomolecules. Low-molecular-weight bis-UPy-oligocaprolactones with cell adhesion promoting UPy-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (UPy-GRGDS) and the synergistic UPy-Pro-His-Ser-Arg-Asn (UPy-PHSRN) peptide sequences are synthesized and studied. The in vitro results indicate strong and specific cell binding of fibroblasts to the UPy-functionalized bioactive materials containing both UPy-peptides. An even more striking effect is seen in vivo where the formation of single giant cells at the interface between bioactive material and tissue is triggered."
1473,A triple-network tricontinuous cubicliquid crystal,2005-06-05,"Soft matter such as surfactant–water systems, block copolymers or liquid crystals can form periodic structures on nanometre to micrometre scales. This property can be used for templating nanoporous ceramics, surface patterning for electronic devices, or generation of photonic materials. Much attention has been paid to structures appearing between the layer and cylinder phases, the three so-called bicontinuous cubic phases. These are formed by two continuous interpenetrating networks of channels. In this article we describe a related phase, which has the first reported structure consisting of three interpenetrating infinite networks. It is a thermotropic (solvent-free) liquid crystal of cubic symmetry Im3̄m. The structure is one of the most complex in liquid crystals, and is determined by direct Fourier reconstruction of electron density. We discuss the possible rationale for the existence of such a phase, its structural relationship with the bicontinuous phases, and its position in the phase diagram."
1474,"Electromagnetic, atomic structure and chemistry changes induced by Ca-doping of low-angle YBa",2005-05-22,"Practical high-temperature superconductors must be textured to minimize the reduction of the critical current density Jgb at misoriented grain boundaries. Partial substitution of Ca for Y in YBa2Cu3O7–δ has shown significant improvement in Jgb but the mechanisms are still not well understood. Here we report atomic-scale, structural and analytical electron microscopy combined with transport measurements on 7° [001]-tilt Y0.7Ca0.3Ba2Cu3O7–δ and YBa2Cu3O7–δ grain boundaries, where the dislocation cores are well separated. We show that the enhanced carrier density, higher Jgb and weaker superconductivity depression at the Ca-doped boundary result from a strong, non-monotonic Ca segregation and structural rearrangements on a scale of ∼1 nm near the dislocation cores. We propose a model of the formation of Ca2+ solute atmospheres in the strain and electric fields of the grain boundary and show that Ca doping expands the dislocation cores yet enhances Jgb by improving the screening and local hole concentration."
1475,Diameter-selective encapsulation of metallocenes in single-walled carbon nanotubes,2005-05-22,"Encapsulation of organic molecules in carbon nanotubes has opened a new route for the fabrication of hybrid nanostructures. Here we show that diameter-selective encapsulation of two metallocene compounds bis(cyclopentadienyl) cobalt and bis(ethylcyclopentadienyl) cobalt has been observed in single-walled carbon nanotubes. In particular, bis(cyclopentadienyl) cobalt is observed to fill only nanotubes of one specific diameter. Electron transfer from the cobalt ions to the nanotubes has been directly observed through a change in the charge state of the encapsulated molecules. The filling of the tubes is found to induce a red-shift of the photoluminescence emission, which is attributed to the formation of localized impurity states below the conduction band of the nanotubes."
1476,Shape-memory nanoparticles from inherently non-spherical polymer colloids,2005-05-15,"Samples of polymeric materials generally have no intrinsic shape; rather their macroscopic form is determined by external forces such as surface tension and memory of shear (for example, during extrusion, moulding or embossing). Hence, in the molten state, the thermodynamically most stable form for polymer (nano)particles is spherical. Here, we present the first example of polymer nanoparticles that have an intrinsic non-spherical shape. We observe the formation of high-aspect-ratio ellipsoidal polymer nanoparticles, of controlled diameter, made from main-chain liquid crystalline polymers using a mini-emulsion technique. The ellipsoidal shape is shown to be an equilibrium (reversible) characteristic and a direct result of the material shape memory when a liquid crystal nanoparticle is in its monodomain form."
1477,Biomaterials functionalization using a novel peptide that selectively binds to a conducting polymer,2005-05-15,"The goal in biomaterial surface modification is to retain a material's bulk properties while modifying only its surface to possess desired recognition and specificity. Here we develop a unique strategy for surface functionalization of an electrically conductive polymer, chlorine-doped polypyrrole (PPyCl), which has been widely researched for various electronic and biomedical applications. An M13 bacteriophage library was used to screen 109 different 12-mer peptide inserts against PPyCl. A binding phage (ϕT59) was isolated, and its binding stability and specificity to PPyCl was assessed using fluorescence microscopy and titer count analysis. The relative binding strength and mechanism of the corresponding 12-mer peptide and its variants was studied using atomic force microscopy and fluorescamine assays. Further, the T59 peptide was joined to a cell adhesive sequence and used to promote cell attachment on PPyCl. This strategy can be extended to immobilize a variety of molecules to PPyCl for numerous applications. In addition, phage display can be applied to other polymers to develop bioactive materials without altering their bulk properties."
1478,A practical route for the fabrication of large single-crystal (RE)–Ba–Cu–O superconductors,2005-05-08,"Single-crystal superconductors of the general formula (LRE)–Ba–Cu–O (light rare earth, LRE = Nd, Sm, Eu and Gd) have considerable potential for engineering applications because of their ability to trap magnetic fields significantly higher than those achievable with permanent magnets. But the lack of a process by which these materials can be fabricated reliably and economically in the form of large single grains has severely hindered their development. We report a practical processing method for the fabrication in air of single-crystal (RE)BCO. The technique is economical and offers considerable freedom in terms of the processing parameters and reproducibility in growth of oriented single grains. The process is based primarily on the development of a new type of generic seed crystal that can effectively promote the epitaxial nucleation of any (RE)BCO system, and secondly on suppressing the formation of RE–Ba solid solution in a controlled manner within large grains processed in air."
1479,Photomechanical actuation in polymer–nanotube composites,2005-05-08,"For some systems, energy from an external source can trigger changes in the internal state of the structure, leading to a mechanical response much larger than the initial input. The ability to unlock this internal work in a solid-state structure is of key importance for many potential applications. We report a novel phenomenon of photo-induced mechanical actuation observed in a polymer–nanotube composite when exposed to infrared radiation. At small strains the sample tends to expand, when stimulated by photons, by an amount that is orders of magnitude greater than the pristine polymer. Conversely, at larger applied pre-strain, it will contract under identical infrared excitation. The behaviour is modelled as a function of orientational ordering of nanotubes induced by the uniaxial extension. It is thought that no other materials can display this continuously reversible response of so large a magnitude, making rubber nanocomposites important for actuator applications."
1480,Breakdown of avalanche critical behaviour in polycrystalline plasticity,2005-05-08,"Acoustic emission experiments on creeping ice as well as numerical simulations argue for a self-organization of collective dislocation dynamics during plastic deformation of single crystals into a scale-free pattern of dislocation avalanches characterized by intermittency, power-law distributions of avalanche sizes, complex space-time correlations and aftershock triggering. Here, we address the question of whether such scale-free, close-to-critical dislocation dynamics will still apply to polycrystals. We show that polycrystalline plasticity is also characterized by intermittency and dislocation avalanches. However, grain boundaries hinder the propagation of avalanches, as revealed by a finite (grain)-size effect on avalanche size distributions. We propose that the restraint of large avalanches builds up internal stresses that push temporally the dynamical system into a supercritical state, off the scale-invariant critical regime, and trigger secondary avalanches in neighbouring grains. This modifies the statistical properties of the avalanche population. The results might also bring into question the classical ways of modelling plasticity in polycrystalline materials, based on homogenization procedures."
1481,Direct visualization of dislocation dynamics in grain-boundary scars,2005-04-17,"Mesoscale objects with unusual structural features may serve as the analogues of atoms in the design of larger-scale materials with novel optical, electronic or mechanical behaviour. In this paper we investigate the structural features and the equilibrium dynamics of micrometre-scale spherical crystals formed by polystyrene particles adsorbed on the surface of a spherical water droplet. The ground state of sufficiently large crystals possesses finite-length grain boundaries (scars). We determine the elastic response of the crystal by measuring single-particle diffusion, and quantify the fluctuations of individual dislocations about their equilibrium positions within a scar by determining the dislocation spring constants. We observe rapid dislocation glide with fluctuations over the barriers separating one local Peierls minimum from the next and rather weak binding of dislocations to their associated scars. The long-distance (renormalized) dislocation diffusion glide constant is extracted directly from the experimental data and is found to be moderately faster than single-particle diffusion. We are also able to determine the parameters of the Peierls potential induced by the underlying crystalline lattice."
1482,Chiral selectivity in the charge-transfer bleaching of single-walled carbon-nanotube spectra,2005-04-10,"Chiral selective reactivity and redox chemistry of carbon nanotubes are two emerging fields of nanoscience. These areas hold strong promise for producing methods for isolating nanotubes into pure samples of a single electronic type, and for reversible doping of nanotubes for electronics applications. Here, we study the selective reactivity of single-walled carbon nanotubes with organic acceptor molecules. We observe spectral bleaching of the nanotube electronic transitions consistent with an electron-transfer reaction occurring from the nanotubes to the organic acceptors. The reaction kinetics are found to have a strong chiral dependence, with rates being slowest for large-bandgap species and increasing for smaller-bandgap nanotubes. The chiral-dependent kinetics can be tuned to effectively freeze the reacted spectra at a fixed chiral distribution. Such tunable redox chemistry may be important for future applications in reversible non-covalent modification of nanotube electronic properties and in chiral selective separations."
1483,Spin chirality on a two-dimensional frustrated lattice,2005-03-27,"The collective behaviour of interacting magnetic moments can be strongly influenced by the topology of the underlying lattice. In geometrically frustrated spin systems, interesting chiral correlations may develop that are related to the spin arrangement on triangular plaquettes. We report a study of the spin chirality on a two-dimensional geometrically frustrated lattice. Our new chemical synthesis methods allow us to produce large single-crystal samples of KFe3(OH)6(SO4)2, an ideal Kagomé lattice antiferromagnet. Combined thermodynamic and neutron scattering measurements reveal that the phase transition to the ordered ground-state is unusual. At low temperatures, application of a magnetic field induces a transition between states with different non-trivial spin-textures."
1484,Trans-interface diffusion-controlled coarsening,2005-03-20,"Accurate theoretical predictions of the volume-fraction dependence during diffusion-controlled coarsening of a polydisperse assembly of particles have proved difficult. Here, a new model of coarsening is presented, involving diffusive transport through the coherent interface between ordered and disordered phases, which atomistic calculations show has a ragged structure. The interface is a diffusion bottleneck when the ordered phase is dispersed. It is predicted that the square of the average radius grows linearly with time, that the depletion of solute decreases as the inverse square-root of time, and that there is no effect of volume fraction on kinetics and the scaled particle-size distributions. These differ dramatically from predictions of modern theories of diffusion-controlled coarsening. Data on coarsening in Ni-Al alloys is examined. We show that no other theory is consistent with the experimentally observed absence of an effect of volume fraction on coarsening of ordered γ′ (Ni3Al) precipitates in a disordered Ni-Al (γ) matrix, and the strong volume-fraction dependence of coarsening of γ precipitates in an ordered γ′ matrix."
1485,Spin-conserving carrier recombination in conjugated polymers,2005-03-20,"The ultimate efficiency of polymer light-emitting diodes is limited by the fraction of charges recombining in the molecular singlet manifold. We address the question of whether this fraction can principally exceed the fundamental limit set down by spin statistics, which requires the possibility of spin changes during exciton formation. Sensitized phosphorescence at 4–300 K enables a direct quantification of spin conversion in coulombically bound electron–hole pairs, the precursors to exciton formation. These are stabilized in external electric fields over times relevant to carrier transport, capture and recombination in devices. No interconversion of exciton intermediates between singlet and triplet configurations is observed. Static magnetic fields are equally unable to induce spin mixing in electroluminescence. Our observations imply substantial exchange splitting at all times during carrier capture. Prior statements regarding increased singlet yields above 25% merely on the basis of higher singlet than triplet formation rates should therefore be re-examined."
1486,Quantum criticality and universal scaling of a quantum antiferromagnet,2005-03-20,"Quantum effects dominate the behaviour of many diverse materials. Of particular current interest are those systems in the vicinity of a quantum critical point (QCP). Their physical properties are predicted to reflect those of the nearby QCP with universal features independent of the microscopic details. The prototypical QCP is the Luttinger liquid (LL), which is of relevance to many quasi-one-dimensional materials. The magnetic material KCuF3 realizes an array of weakly coupled spin chains (or LLs) and thus lies close to but not exactly at the LL quantum critical point. By using inelastic neutron scattering we have collected a complete data set of the magnetic correlations of KCuF3 as a function of momentum, energy and temperature. The LL description is found to be valid over an extensive range of these parameters, and departures from this behaviour at high and low energies and temperatures are identified and explained."
1487,Duality of fatigue failures of materials caused by Poisson defect statistics of competing failure modes,2005-03-20,"The statistical nature of failures of components subjected to fatigue loading is a major challenge in engineering applications. Here, we report an interesting fatigue phenomenon in which there is a 'duality' of the S–N fatigue data (S is stress and N is cycles to failure)—the grouping of data into two distinct S–N curves as a result of two competing failure modes. The proportions of failure by either mode are about the same and one cannot predict which failure mode will eventually dominate. This means that fatigue lives may be unpredictable in materials under certain application conditions and the consequences can be disastrous. Based on Poisson defect statistics and Monte Carlo simulations, we show that this phenomenon can arise from the Poisson distribution of low populations of microscale defects. An unexpected finding is that there should be a combination of average defect density and specimen area at which this phenomenon is observable in materials having sparsely populated defects."
1488,Thin films of hard cubic Zr,2005-03-13,"Hard, refractory thin films consisting of group IVB element mono-nitrides deposited using various chemical and physical vapour-deposition techniques are widely used in wear-resistant applications. As the demand for performance exceeds the capabilities of existing materials, new materials with superior properties must be developed. Here we report the realization and characterization of hard cubic Zr3N4 (c-Zr3N4) thin films. The films, deposited using a novel but industrially viable modified filtered cathodic arc (FCA) method, undergo a phase transformation from orthorhombic to cubic above a critical stress level of 9 GPa as determined by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The c-Zr3N4 films are significantly harder (∼36 GPa) than both the orthorhombic Zr3N4 (o-Zr3N4) and ZrN films (∼27 GPa). The ability to deposit this material directly onto components as a thin film will allow its use in wear- and oxidation-resistant applications."
1489,Low-cost and nanoscale non-volatile memory concept for future silicon chips,2005-03-13,"Non-volatile 'flash' memories are key components of integrated circuits because they retain their data when power is interrupted. Despite their great commercial success, the semiconductor industry is searching for alternative non-volatile memories with improved performance and better opportunities for scaling down the size of memory cells. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of a new semiconductor memory concept. The individual memory cell is based on a narrow line of phase-change material. By sending low-power current pulses through the line, the phase-change material can be programmed reversibly between two distinguishable resistive states on a timescale of nanoseconds. Reducing the dimensions of the phase-change line to the nanometre scale improves the performance in terms of speed and power consumption. These advantages are achieved by the use of a doped-SbTe phase-change material. The simplicity of the concept promises that integration into a logic complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process flow might be possible with only a few additional lithographic steps."
1490,Towards molecular spintronics,2005-03-06,"The ability to manipulate electron spin in organic molecular materials offers a new and extremely tantalizing route towards spin electronics, both from fundamental and technological points of view. This is mainly due to the unquestionable advantage of weak spin–orbit and hyperfine interactions in organic molecules, which leads to the possibility of preserving spin-coherence over times and distances much longer than in conventional metals or semiconductors. Here we demonstrate theoretically that organic spin valves, obtained by sandwiching an organic molecule between magnetic contacts, can show a large bias-dependent magnetoresistance and that this can be engineered by an appropriate choice of molecules and anchoring groups. Our results, obtained through a combination of state-of-the-art non-equilibrium transport methods and density functional theory, show that although the magnitude of the effect varies with the details of the molecule, large magnetoresistance can be found both in the tunnelling and the metallic limit."
1491,"Lead zirconate titanate thin films directly on copper electrodes for ferroelectric, dielectric and piezoelectric applications",2005-02-20,"Replacement of noble metal electrodes by base metals significantly lowers the cost of ferroelectric, piezoelectric and dielectric devices. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to process lead zirconate (Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3, or PZT) thin films directly on base metal copper foils. We explore the impact of the oxygen partial pressure during processing, and demonstrate that high-quality films and interfaces can be achieved through control of the oxygen partial pressure within a narrow window predicted by thermodynamic stability considerations. This demonstration has broad implications, opening up the possibility of the use of low-cost, high-conductivity copper electrodes for a range of Pb-based perovskite materials, including PZT films in embedded printed circuit board applications for capacitors, varactors and sensors; multilayer PZT piezoelectric stacks; and multilayer dielectric and electrostrictive devices based on lead magnesium niobate–lead titanate. We also point out that the capacitors do not fatigue on repeated switching, unlike those with Pt noble metal electrodes. Instead, they appear to be fatigue-resistant, like capacitors with oxide electrodes. This may have implications for ferroelectric non-volatile memories."
1492,High-performance solution-processed polymer ferroelectric field-effect transistors,2005-02-20,"We demonstrate a rewritable, non-volatile memory device with flexible plastic active layers deposited from solution. The memory device is a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) made with a ferroelectric fluoropolymer and a bisalkoxy-substituted poly(p-phenylene vinylene) semiconductor material. The on- and off-state drain currents differ by several orders of magnitude, and have a long retention time, a high programming cycle endurance and short programming time. The remanent semiconductor surface charge density in the on-state has a high value of 18 mC m−2, which explains the large on/off ratio. Application of a moderate gate field raises the surface charge to 26 mC m−2, which is of a magnitude that is very difficult to obtain with conventional FETs because they are limited by dielectric breakdown of the gate insulator. In this way, the present ferroelectric–semiconductor interface extends the attainable field-effect band bending in organic semiconductors."
1493,The existence of a temperature-driven solid solution in Li,2005-02-20,"Lithium-ion batteries have revolutionized the powering of portable electronics. Electrode reactions in these electrochemical systems are based on reversible insertion/deinsertion of Li+ ions into the host electrode material with a concomitant addition/removal of electrons into the host. If such batteries are to find a wider market such as the automotive industry, less expensive positive electrode materials will be required, among which LiFePO4 is a leading contender. An intriguing fundamental problem is to understand the fast electrochemical response from the poorly electronic conducting two-phase LiFePO4/FePO4 system. In contrast to the well-documented two-phase nature of this system at room temperature, we give the first experimental evidence of a solid solution LixFePO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) at 450 °C, and two new metastable phases at room temperature with Li0.75FePO4 and Li0.5FePO4 composition. These experimental findings challenge theorists to improve predictive models commonly used in the field. Our results may also lead to improved performances of these electrodes at elevated temperatures."
1494,Measuring the surface stress polar dependence,2005-02-13,"Although measurements of the polar dependence of the surface free energy are easily available, measurements of the whole polar dependence of the surface stress of a crystal do not exist. Here, we present a procedure that allows the experimental determination of this dependence. For this purpose, electromigration was used to control the kinetic faceting of surface orientations that belong to the equilibrium shape of the crystal, and for each destabilized surface, the period of faceting as well as the crystallographic angles of the appearing facets were measured by atomic force microscopy. The data obtained lead to a set of equations whose mathematical solution, compatible with physical constraints, gives access to the surface stress polar dependence of the whole crystal, and thus to a better understanding of surface stress properties."
1495,The generic enhancement of photochromic dye switching speeds in a rigid polymer matrix,2005-02-06,"The switching or isomerization speed of photochromic dyes in a rigid polymeric matrix (such as an ophthalmic lens) is generally significantly slower than that observed in the mobile environment of a solution. Here we describe that the attachment of flexible oligomers having a low glass-transition temperature—such as poly(dimethylsiloxane)—to photochromic dyes greatly increases their switching speeds in a rigid polymer matrix. The greatest impact was observed in the thermal fade parameters T1/2 and T3/4—the times it takes for the optical density to reduce by half and three quarters of the initial optical density of the coloured state—which were reduced by 40–95% and 60–99% respectively for spirooxazines, chromenes and an azo dye in a host polymer with a glass-transition temperature of 120 °C. The method does not alter the electronic nature of the dyes but simply protects them from the host matrix and provides greater molecular mobility for the switching process. In addition to ophthalmic lenses, the generic nature of the method may find further utility in data recording or optical switching."
1496,Molecularly inherent voltage-controlled conductance switching,2005-01-16,"Molecular electronics has been proposed as a pathway for high-density nanoelectronic devices. This pathway involves the development of a molecular memory device based on reversible switching of a molecule between two conducting states in response to a trigger, such as an applied voltage. Here we demonstrate that voltage-triggered switching is indeed a molecular phenomenon by carrying out studies on the same molecule using three different experimental configurations—scanning tunnelling microscopy, crossed-wire junction, and magnetic-bead junction. We also demonstrate that voltage-triggered switching is distinctly different from stochastic switching, essentially a transient (time-dependent) phenomenon that is independent of the applied voltage."
1497,Donor impurity band exchange in dilute ferromagnetic oxides,2005-01-16,"Dilute ferromagnetic oxides having Curie temperatures far in excess of 300 K and exceptionally large ordered moments per transition-metal cation challenge our understanding of magnetism in solids. These materials are high-k dielectrics with degenerate or thermally activated n-type semiconductivity. Conventional super-exchange or double-exchange interactions cannot produce long-range magnetic order at concentrations of magnetic cations of a few percent. We propose that ferromagnetic exchange here, and in dilute ferromagnetic nitrides, is mediated by shallow donor electrons that form bound magnetic polarons, which overlap to create a spin-split impurity band. The Curie temperature in the mean-field approximation varies as (xδ)1/2 where x and δ are the concentrations of magnetic cations and donors, respectively. High Curie temperatures arise only when empty minority-spin or majority-spin d states lie at the Fermi level in the impurity band. The magnetic phase diagram includes regions of semiconducting and metallic ferromagnetism, cluster paramagnetism, spin glass and canted antiferromagnetism."
1498,Self-assembled microdevices driven by muscle,2005-01-16,"Current procedures for manual extraction of mature muscle tissue in micromechanical structures are time consuming and can damage the living components. To overcome these limitations, we have devised a new system for assembling muscle-powered microdevices based on judicious manipulations of materials phases and interfaces. In this system, individual cells grow and self-assemble into muscle bundles that are integrated with micromechanical structures and can be controllably released to enable free movement. Having realized such an assembly with cardiomyocytes we demonstrate two potential applications: a force transducer able to characterize in situ the mechanical properties of muscle and a self-assembled hybrid (biotic/abiotic) microdevice that moves as a consequence of collective cooperative contraction of muscle bundles. Because the fabrication of silicon microdevices is independent of the subsequent assembly of muscle cells, this system is highly versatile and may lead to the integration of cells and tissues with a variety of other microstructures."
1499,Multiscale modelling of defect kinetics in irradiated iron,2004-12-19,"Changes in microstructure and mechanical properties of nuclear materials are governed by the kinetics of defects produced by irradiation. The population of vacancies, interstitials and their clusters can however be followed only indirectly, for example by macroscopic resistivity measurements. The information on the mobility, recombination, clustering or dissociation of defects provided by such experiments is both extremely rich and difficult to interpret. By combining ab initio and kinetic Monte Carlo methods, we successfully reproduce the abrupt resistivity changes—so-called recovery stages—observed upon annealing at increasing temperatures after electron irradiation in α-iron. New features in the mechanisms responsible for these stages are revealed. We show that di-vacancies and tri-interstitials contribute to the stages attributed to mono-vacancy and di-interstitial migration respectively. We also predict the effect of the unexpected low migration barriers found for tri- and quadri-vacancies, and discuss the challenging questions raised by the mobility of larger defect clusters."
1500,Self-assembly of polymeric microspheres of complex internal structures,2004-12-19,"Self-assembly can easily produce intricate structures that would be difficult to make by conventional fabrication means. Here, self-assembly is used to prepare multicomponent polymeric microspheres of arbitrary internal symmetries. Droplets of liquid prepolymers are printed onto a water-soluble hydrogel, and are allowed to spread and coalesce into composite patches. These patches are then immersed in an isodense liquid, which both compensates the force of gravity and dissolves the gel beneath the polymers. Subsequently, the patches fold into spheres whose internal structures are dictated by the arrangement of the droplets printed onto the surface. The spheres can be solidified either thermally or by ultraviolet radiation. We present a theoretical analysis of droplet spreading, coalescence and folding. Conditions for the stability of the folded microspheres are derived from linear stability analysis. The composite microbeads that we describe are likely to find uses in optics, colloidal self-assembly and controlled-delivery applications."
1501,Dynamic control of the photonic smectic order of membranes,2004-12-19,"Self-assembled soft matter is often used in photonics because its characteristic length scale can be of the order of the wavelength of light. For example, a hyperswollen lamellar phase composed of bilayer membranes reflects visible light by the Bragg diffraction and acts as a photonic smectic crystal. The softness of such a structure allows us to dynamically control its photonic characteristics using an external field, as reported here. The smectic order of membranes is destabilized by doping charged colloidal particles into intermembrane water regions. However, we found that anisotropic coherent motion of particles along membranes induced by an alternating electric field enhances the degree of the photonic smectic order significantly. This demonstrates that entropic interactions can be controlled by modulating the membrane fluctuations through their dynamic coupling to an external field."
1502,Anisotropic particle synthesis in dielectrophoretically controlled microdroplet reactors,2004-12-19,"The miniaturization of chemical and biological processes in microfluidic devices and bioarrays is a major technological achievement. Microchips performing multiphase material synthesis operations could be a future step in this trend of miniaturizing technology. Here we show how electrically controlled chips can be used for the synthesis and manipulation of new types of particles with advanced structure. The method is based on a technique that allows freely suspended droplets and particles to be entrapped and transported using electric fields. The fields that hold and guide the droplets and particles are applied through arrays of electrodes submerged in the oil. Each of the microdroplets suspended on the surface of fluorinated liquid serves as a microscopic reactor, where the particles are formed by solidification of the carrier droplets. Controlled on-chip assembly, drying, encapsulation and polymerization were used to make anisotropic 'eyeball' and striped particles, polymer capsules and semiconducting microbeads."
1503,Near-infrared optical sensors based on single-walled carbon nanotubes,2004-12-12,"Molecular detection using near-infrared light between 0.9 and 1.3 eV has important biomedical applications because of greater tissue penetration and reduced auto-fluorescent background in thick tissue or whole-blood media. Carbon nanotubes have a tunable near-infrared emission that responds to changes in the local dielectric function but remains stable to permanent photobleaching. In this work, we report the synthesis and successful testing of solution-phase, near-infrared sensors, with β-D-glucose sensing as a model system, using single-walled carbon nanotubes that modulate their emission in response to the adsorption of specific biomolecules. New types of non-covalent functionalization using electron-withdrawing molecules are shown to provide sites for transferring electrons in and out of the nanotube. We also show two distinct mechanisms of signal transduction—fluorescence quenching and charge transfer. The results demonstrate new opportunities for nanoparticle optical sensors that operate in strongly absorbing media of relevance to medicine or biology."
1504,Full bulk spin polarization and intrinsic tunnel barriers at the surface of layered manganites,2004-12-12,"Transmission of information using the spin of the electron as well as its charge requires a high degree of spin polarization at surfaces. However, at surfaces this degree of polarization can be quenched by competing interactions. Using a combination of surface-sensitive X-ray and tunnelling probes, we show for the quasi-two-dimensional bilayer manganites that only the outermost Mn–O bilayer is affected: it is a 1-nm-thick insulator that exhibits no long-range ferromagnetic order, whereas the next bilayer displays the full spin polarization of the bulk. Such an abrupt localization of the surface effects is due to the two-dimensional nature of the layered manganite, and the loss of ferromagnetism is attributed to weakened double exchange in the reconstructed surface bilayer and a resultant antiferromagnetic phase. The creation of a well-defined surface insulator atop a fully spin-polarized bulk demonstrates the ability of two of the most demanding components of an ideal magnetic tunnel junction to self-assemble naturally."
1505,Enhanced spin accumulation and novel magnetotransport in nanoparticles,2004-12-05,"Spin injection and accumulation are key phenomena supporting a variety of concepts for spin-electronic devices. These phenomena are expected to be enhanced in nanoparticles over bulk structures due to their discrete energy levels and large charging energies. In this article, precise magnetotransport measurements in the single-electron tunnelling regime are performed by preparing appropriate microfabricated devices containing cobalt nanoparticles. Here we provide experimental evidence for characteristic features of spin accumulation in magnetic nanoparticles, such as oscillations of the magnetoresistance with a periodical sign change as a function of bias voltage. Theoretical analysis of the magnetoresistance behaviour clearly shows that the spin-relaxation time in nanoparticles is highly enhanced in comparison with that in the bulk."
1506,Supramolecular organization in ultra-thin films of α-sexithiophene on silicon dioxide,2004-12-05,"The supramolecular organization of organic semiconductors on the dielectric layer of thin-film field-effect transistors is a crucial factor in achieving good device performance. Charge transport in these devices occurs near the interface with the gate dielectric. By confocal spectroscopy and microscopy we study the supramolecular organization in ultra-thin films of a prototype organic semiconductor, α-sexithiophene, on silicon dioxide, a widely used transistor gate dielectric. We demonstrate that in submonolayer films of sexithiophene (T6), regions where the molecules stand on their long molecular axis coexist with regions where the molecules lie flat on the substrate. When the first monolayer is completed, all T6 molecules stand on the substrate, and the flat molecules detected in the submonolayer films are no longer present. In films thicker than two monolayers, the photoluminescence spectra of standing molecules show a molecular H-like aggregation as in the single crystal."
1507,Very large electro-optic responses in H-bonded heteroaromatic films grown by physical vapour deposition,2004-11-28,"A crucial goal for modern telecommunications systems is development of very high-speed components for broadband (>100 GHz), all-optical signal/information processing. The core component of such technologies is the electro-optic modulator, which encodes electrical signals onto fibre-optic transmissions. A significant challenge therefore is obtaining materials that have large electro-optic responses and that can be readily fabricated into devices at low cost. We report here on the realization of high-response heteroaromatic organic chromophores that can be straightforwardly self-organized from the vapour phase into intrinsically acentric, high-quality, micrometre-scale films. These π-conjugated electro-optically active films (with second-order susceptibilities up to ∼100 pm V−1) are thermally stable and conveniently grown by a simple physical vapour deposition process in a few hours. Supramolecular acentricity is achieved without electric field poling, enforced by biomimetic heterocycle–hydroxycarbonyl head-to-tail hydrogen-bonding."
1508,Programmable polymer thin film and non-volatile memory device,2004-11-28,"Building on the success of organic electronic devices, such as light-emitting diodes and field-effect transistors, procedures for fabricating non-volatile organic memory devices are now being explored. Here, we demonstrate a novel organic memory device fabricated by solution processing. Programmable electrical bistability was observed in a device made from a polystyrene film containing gold nanoparticles and 8-hydroxyquinoline sandwiched between two metal electrodes. The as-prepared device, which is in a low-conductivity state, displays an abrupt transition to a high-conductivity state under an external bias of 2.8 V. These two states differ in conductivity by about four orders of magnitude. Applying a negative bias of 1.8 V causes the device to return to the low-conductivity state. The electronic transition is attributed to the electric-field-induced charge transfer between the gold nanoparticles and 8-hydroxyquinoline. The transition from the low- to the high-conductivity state takes place in nanoseconds, and is non-volatile, indicating that the device may be used for low-cost, high-density memory storage."
1509,Atomic dynamics and Marangoni films during liquid-metal spreading,2004-11-14,"Despite its apparent simplicity, spreading of liquid metals at high temperatures has defied description and generalization. Wetting at high temperature is usually accompanied by interdiffusion and chemical reaction, but the forces that drive reactive spreading and the mechanisms that control its kinetics have been very poorly understood. The unsolved challenge has been to link macroscopic measurements such as the dynamic contact angle or the speed of a moving liquid front to phenomena occurring at the microscopic and even atomic level in the vicinity of the triple solid–liquid–vapour junction. We have taken a big step towards meeting this challenge. Our systematic analysis of the spreading of metal–metal systems with varying degrees of mutual solubility allows us to report on the fundamental differences between the mechanisms controlling spreading of organic liquids and liquid metals and on formation of Marangoni films driven by surface-tension gradients in high-temperature systems."
1510,Surface grafting of artificial joints with a biocompatible polymer for preventing periprosthetic osteolysis,2004-10-24,"Periprosthetic osteolysis—bone loss in the vicinity of a prosthesis—is the most serious problem limiting the longevity of artificial joints. It is caused by bone-resorptive responses to wear particles originating from the articulating surface. This study investigated the effects of graft polymerization of our original biocompatible phospholipid polymer 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) onto the polyethylene surface. Mechanical studies using a hip-joint simulator revealed that the MPC grafting markedly decreased the friction and the amount of wear. Osteoclastic bone resorption induced by subperiosteal injection of particles onto mouse calvariae was abolished by the MPC grafting on particles. MPC-grafted particles were shown to be biologically inert by culture systems with respect to phagocytosis and resorptive cytokine secretion by macrophages, subsequent expression of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand in osteoblasts, and osteoclastogenesis from bone marrow cells. From the mechanical and biological advantages, we believe that our approach will make a major improvement in artificial joints by preventing periprosthetic osteolysis."
1511,Amorphous silicon exhibits a glass transition,2004-10-24,"Amorphous silicon is a semiconductor with a lower density than the metallic silicon liquid. It is widely believed that the amorphous–liquid transition is a first-order melting transition. In contrast to this, recent computer simulations and the experimental observation of pressure-induced amorphization of nanoporous silicon have revived the idea of an underlying liquid–liquid phase transition implying the existence of a low-density liquid and its glass transition to the amorphous solid. Here we demonstrate that during irradiation with high-energy heavy ions amorphous silicon deforms plastically in the same way as conventional glasses. This behaviour provides experimental evidence for the existence of the low-density liquid. The glass transition temperature for a timescale of 10 picoseconds is estimated to be about 1,000 K. Our results support the idea of liquid polymorphism as a general phenomenon in tetrahedral networks."
1512,Electrical spin injection from an n-type ferromagnetic semiconductor into a III–V device heterostructure,2004-10-17,"The use of carrier spin in semiconductors is a promising route towards new device functionality and performance. Ferromagnetic semiconductors (FMSs) are promising materials in this effort. An n-type FMS that can be epitaxially grown on a common device substrate is especially attractive. Here, we report electrical injection of spin-polarized electrons from an n-type FMS, CdCr2Se4, into an AlGaAs/GaAs-based light-emitting diode structure. An analysis of the electroluminescence polarization based on quantum selection rules provides a direct measure of the sign and magnitude of the injected electron spin polarization. The sign reflects minority rather than majority spin injection, consistent with our density-functional-theory calculations of the CdCr2Se4 conduction-band edge. This approach confirms the exchange-split band structure and spin-polarized carrier population of an FMS, and demonstrates a litmus test for these FMS hallmarks that discriminates against spurious contributions from magnetic precipitates."
1513,Composite mesostructures by nano-confinement,2004-10-17,"In a physically confined environment, interfacial interactions, symmetry breaking, structural frustration and confinement-induced entropy loss can play dominant roles in determining molecular organization. Here we present a systematic study of the confined assembly of silica–surfactant composite mesostructures within cylindrical nanochannels of varying diameters. Using exactly the same precursors and reaction conditions that form the two-dimensional hexagonal SBA-15 mesostructured thin film, unprecedented silica mesostructures with chiral mesopores such as single- and double-helical geometries spontaneously form inside individual alumina nanochannels. On tightening the degree of confinement, a transition is observed in the mesopore morphology from a coiled cylindrical to a spherical cage-like geometry. Self-consistent field calculations carried out to account for the observed mesostructures accord well with experiment. The mesostructures produced by confined syntheses are useful as templates for fabricating highly ordered mesostructured nanowires and nanowire arrays."
1514,Alloy catalysts designed from first principles,2004-10-17,"The rational design of pure and alloy metal catalysts from fundamental principles has the potential to yield catalysts of greatly improved activity and selectivity. A promising area of research concerns the role that near-surface alloys (NSAs) can play in endowing surfaces with novel catalytic properties. NSAs are defined as alloys wherein a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk; here we use density functional theory calculations to introduce a new class of these alloys that can yield superior catalytic behaviour for hydrogen-related reactions. Some of these NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as the noble metals (Cu, Au) while, at the same time, dissociating H2 much more easily. This unique set of properties may permit these alloys to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceuticals production and as robust fuel-cell anodes."
1515,Domain-wall superconductivity in superconductor–ferromagnet hybrids,2004-10-03,"Superconductivity and magnetism are two antagonistic cooperative phenomena, and the intriguing problem of their coexistence has been studied for several decades. Recently, artificial hybrid superconductor–ferromagnet systems have been commonly used as model systems to reveal the interplay between competing superconducting and magnetic order parameters, and to verify the existence of new physical phenomena, including the predicted domain-wall superconductivity (DWS). Here we report the experimental observation of DWS in superconductor–ferromagnet hybrids using a niobium film on a BaFe12O19 single crystal. We found that the critical temperature Tc of the superconductivity nucleation in niobium increases with increasing field until it reaches the saturation field of BaFe12O19. In accordance with the field-shift of the maximum value of Tc, pronounced hysteresis effects have been found in resistive transitions. We argue that the compensation of the applied field by the stray fields of the magnetic domains as well as the change in the domain structure is responsible for the appearance of the DWS and the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in the superconductor–ferromagnet hybrids."
1516,Nanostructure engineering by templated self-assembly of block copolymers,2004-10-03,"Self-assembling materials are the building blocks for bottom-up nanofabrication processes, but many self-assembled nanostructures contain defects and lack sufficient long-range order for certain nanotechnology applications. Here we investigate the formation of defects in a self-assembled array of spherical block-copolymer microdomains, using topographical templates to control the local self-assembly. Perfect ordered sphere arrays can form in both constant-width templates and width-modulated templates. For modulated templates, transition between configurations having a constant number of rows and configurations of stable arrays with varying numbers of rows is shown to be analogous to dislocation formation in an epitaxial thin film system. Based on the configuration transition energy and fluctuation energy, designed templates with a high tolerance for lithographical imperfections can direct precisely modulated block-copolymer nanostructures. This study provides insights into the design of hybrid systems combining top-down and bottom-up fabrication."
1517,On the origin of high-temperature ferromagnetism in the low-temperature-processed Mn–Zn–O system,2004-09-26,"The recent discovery of ferromagnetism above room temperature in low-temperature-processed MnO2–ZnO has generated significant interest. Using suitably designed bulk and thin-film studies, we demonstrate that the ferromagnetism in this system originates in a metastable phase rather than by carrier-induced interaction between separated Mn atoms in ZnO. The ferromagnetism persists up to ∼980 K, and further heating transforms the metastable phase and kills the ferromagnetism. By studying the interface diffusion and reaction between thin-film bilayers of Mn and Zn oxides, we show that a uniform solution of Mn in ZnO does not form under low-temperature processing. Instead, a metastable ferromagnetic phase develops by Zn diffusion into the Mn oxide. Direct low-temperature film growth of Zn-incorporated Mn oxide by pulsed laser deposition shows ferromagnetism at low Zn concentration for an optimum oxygen growth pressure. Our results strongly suggest that the observed ferromagnetic phase is oxygen-vacancy-stabilized Mn2−xZnxO3−δ."
1518,Freely suspended nanocomposite membranes as highly sensitive sensors,2004-09-26,"Highly sensitive sensor arrays are in high demand for prospective applications in remote sensing and imaging. Measuring microscopic deflections of compliant micromembranes and cantilevers is developing into one of the most versatile approaches for thermal, acoustic and chemical sensing. Here, we report on an innovative fabrication of compliant nanocomposite membranes with nanoscale thickness showing extraordinary sensitivity and dynamic range, which makes them candidates for a new generation of membrane-based sensor arrays. These nanomembranes with a thickness of 25–70 nm, which can be freely suspended over large (hundred micrometres) openings are fabricated with molecular precision by time-efficient, spin-assisted layer-by-layer assembly. They are designed as multilayered molecular composites made of a combination of polymeric monolayers and a metal nanoparticle intralayer. We demonstrate that these nanocomposite membranes possess unparalleled sensitivity and a unique autorecovering ability. The membrane nanostructure that is responsible for these outstanding properties combines multilayered polymer/nanoparticle organization, high polymer-chain orientation, and a pre-stretched state."
1519,A structural model for metallic glasses,2004-09-19,"Despite the intense interest in metallic glasses for a variety of engineering applications, many details of their structure remain a mystery. Here, we present the first compelling atomic structural model for metallic glasses. This structural model is based on a new sphere-packing scheme—the dense packing of atomic clusters. Random positioning of solvent atoms and medium-range atomic order of solute atoms are combined to reproduce diffraction data successfully over radial distances up to ∼1 nm. Although metallic glasses can have any number of chemically distinct solute species, this model shows that they contain no more than three topologically distinct solutes and that these solutes have specific and predictable sizes relative to the solvent atoms. Finally, this model includes defects that provide richness to the structural description of metallic glasses. The model accurately predicts the number of solute atoms in the first coordination shell of a typical solvent atom, and provides a remarkable ability to predict metallic-glass compositions accurately for a wide range of simple and complex alloys."
1520,Multicolour micropatterning of thin films of dry gels,2004-09-19,"Micropatterning of surfaces with several chemicals at different spatial locations usually requires multiple stamping and registration steps. Here, we describe an experimental method based on reaction–diffusion phenomena that allows for simultaneous micropatterning of a substrate with several coloured chemicals. In this method, called wet stamping (WETS), aqueous solutions of two or more inorganic salts are delivered onto a film of dry, ionically doped gelatin from an agarose stamp patterned in bas relief. Once in conformal contact, these salts diffuse into the gelatin, where they react to give deeply coloured precipitates. Separation of colours in the plane of the surface is the consequence of the differences in the diffusion coefficients, the solubility products, and the amounts of different salts delivered from the stamp, and is faithfully reproduced by a theoretical model based on a system of reaction–diffusion partial differential equations. The multicolour micropatterns are useful as non-binary optical elements, and could potentially form the basis of new applications in microseparations and in controlled delivery."
1521,Understanding the phase-change mechanism of rewritable optical media,2004-09-12,"Present-day multimedia strongly rely on rewritable phase-change optical memories. We demonstrate that, different from the current consensus, Ge2Sb2Te5, the material of choice in DVD-RAM, does not possess the rocksalt structure but more likely consists of well-defined rigid building blocks that are randomly oriented in space consistent with cubic symmetry. Laser-induced amorphization results in drastic shortening of covalent bonds and a decrease in the mean-square relative displacement, demonstrating a substantial increase in the degree of short-range ordering, in sharp contrast to the amorphization of typical covalently bonded solids. This novel order–disorder transition is due to an umbrella-flip of Ge atoms from an octahedral position into a tetrahedral position without rupture of strong covalent bonds. It is this unique two-state nature of the transformation that ensures fast DVD performance and repeatable switching over ten million cycles."
1522,Predicting the structure of screw dislocations in nanoporous materials,2004-09-07,"Extended microscale crystal defects, including dislocations and stacking faults, can radically alter the properties of technologically important materials. Determining the atomic structure and the influence of defects on properties remains a major experimental and computational challenge. Using a newly developed simulation technique, the structure of the 1/2a <100> screw dislocation in nanoporous zeolite A has been modelled. The predicted channel structure has a spiral form that resembles a nanoscale corkscrew. Our findings suggest that the dislocation will enhance the transport of molecules from the surface to the interior of the crystal while retarding transport parallel to the surface. Crucially, the dislocation creates an activated, locally chiral environment that may have enantioselective applications. These predictions highlight the influence that microscale defects have on the properties of structurally complex materials, in addition to their pivotal role in crystal growth."
1523,Protein-modified nanocrystalline diamond thin films for biosensor applications,2004-09-07,"Diamond exhibits several special properties, for example good biocompatibility and a large electrochemical potential window, that make it particularly suitable for biofunctionalization and biosensing. Here we show that proteins can be attached covalently to nanocrystalline diamond thin films. Moreover, we show that, although the biomolecules are immobilized at the surface, they are still fully functional and active. Hydrogen-terminated nanocrystalline diamond films were modified by using a photochemical process to generate a surface layer of amino groups, to which proteins were covalently attached. We used green fluorescent protein to reveal the successful coupling directly. After functionalization of nanocrystalline diamond electrodes with the enzyme catalase, a direct electron transfer between the enzyme's redox centre and the diamond electrode was detected. Moreover, the modified electrode was found to be sensitive to hydrogen peroxide. Because of its dual role as a substrate for biofunctionalization and as an electrode, nanocrystalline diamond is a very promising candidate for future biosensor applications."
1524,A first-order Mott transition in Li,2004-08-22,"Despite many years of experimental searches for a first-order Mott transition in crystalline-doped semiconductors, none have been found. Extensive experimental work has characterized a first-order metal–insulator transition in LixCoO2, the classic material for rechargeable Li batteries, with a metallic state for x < 0.75 and insulating for x > 0.95. Using density functional theory calculations on large supercells, we identify the mechanism of this hereto anomalous metal–insulator transition as a Mott transition of impurities. Density functional theory demonstrates that for dilute Li-vacancy concentrations, the vacancy binds a hole and forms impurity states yielding a Mott insulator. The unique feature of LixCoO2 as compared with traditional doped semiconductors, such as Si:P, is the high mobility of the Li vacancies, which allows them to rearrange into two distinct phases at the temperature of the metal–insulator transition."
1525,Bismuth-induced embrittlement of copper grain boundaries,2004-08-22,"Catastrophic brittle fracture of crystalline materials is one of the best documented but most poorly understood fundamental phenomena in materials science. Embrittlement of copper by bismuth is a classic example of this phenomenon. Because brittle fracture in any structural material can involve human tragedy, a better understanding of the mechanisms behind it is of the highest interest. In this study, we use a combination of two state-of-the-art atomic characterization techniques and ab initio theoretical materials simulations to investigate the geometric and electronic structure of a copper grain boundary with and without bismuth. Only with this unique combination of methods are we able to observe the actual distribution of bismuth in the boundary and detect changes in the electronic structure caused by the bismuth impurity. We find that the copper atoms that surround the segregated bismuth in the grain boundary become embrittled by taking on a more zinc-like electronic structure."
1526,The origin of highly efficient selective emission in rare-earth oxides for thermophotovoltaic applications,2004-08-22,"Rare-earth oxide materials emit thermal radiation in a narrow spectral region, and can be used for a variety of different high-temperature applications, such as the generation of electricity by thermophotovoltaic conversion of thermal radiation. However, because a detailed understanding of the mechanism of selective emission from rare-earth atoms has so far been missing, attempts to engineer selective emitters have relied mainly on empirical approaches. In this work, we present a new quantum thermodynamic model to describe the mechanisms of thermal pumping and radiative de-excitation in rare-earth oxide materials. By evaluating the effects of the local crystal-field symmetry around a rare-earth ion, this model clearly explains how and why only some of the room-temperature absorption peaks give rise to highly efficient emission bands at high temperature (1,000–1,500 °C). High-temperature emissivity measurements along with photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence results confirm the predictions of the theory."
1527,Silica films with a single-crystalline mesoporous structure,2004-08-15,"Films of mesoporous materials attract broad interest because of their wide applicability in the fields of optics and electronics. Although many of these films have a regular local porous structure, the structural regularity has not been used practically yet because of difficulties in its control on macroscopic scales. Here, we demonstrate the preparation of mesoporous silica films whose porous structure can be described as a single crystal, that is, a long-range order of cage-like pores is maintained over centimetre scales. These films have a three-dimensional hexagonal (space group P63/mmc) porous structure, and the in-plane arrangement of the pores is strictly controlled by a polymeric substrate surface that has been treated by rubbing. This new class of single-crystalline films with mesoscopic periodic structure is a significant breakthrough in bottom-up nanotechnology, and could lead to novel devices, for example, optics in a soft X-ray region, and quantum electronics."
1528,A general mechanism of polycrystalline growth,2004-08-08,"Most research into microstructure formation during solidification has focused on single-crystal growth ranging from faceted crystals to symmetric dendrites. However, these growth forms can be perturbed by heterogeneities, yielding a rich variety of polycrystalline growth patterns. Phase-field simulations show that the presence of particulates (for example, dirt) or a small rotational–translational mobility ratio (characteristic of high supercooling) in crystallizing fluids give rise to similar growth patterns, implying a duality in the growth process in these structurally heterogeneous fluids. Similar crystallization patterns are also found in thin polymer films with particulate additives and pure films with high supercooling. This duality between the static and dynamic heterogeneity explains the ubiquity of polycrystalline growth patterns in polymeric and other complex fluids."
1529,Self-assembly and properties of diblock copolymers by coarse-grain molecular dynamics,2004-08-08,"Block-copolymer amphiphiles have been observed to assemble into vesicles and other morphologies long known for lipids but with remarkably different properties. Coarse-grain molecular dynamics (CG-MD) is used herein to elaborate the structures and properties of diblock copolymer assemblies in water. By varying the hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio of the copolymer in line with experiment, bilayer, cylindrical and spherical micelle morphologies spontaneously assemble. Varying the molecular weight (MW) with hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio appropriate to a bilayer yields a hydrophobic core thickness that scales for large MW as a random coil polymer, in agreement with experiment. The extent of hydrophobic-segment overlap in the core increases nonlinearly with MW, indicative of chain entanglements and consistent with the dramatic decrease reported for lateral mobility in polymer vesicles. Calculated trends with MW as well as hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio thus agree with experiment, demonstrating that CG-MD simulations provide a rational design tool for diblock copolymer assemblies."
1530,Flow-induced properties of nanotube-filled polymer materials,2004-07-25,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are under intense investigation in materials science owing to their potential for modifying the electrical conductivity σ, shear viscosity η, and other transport properties of polymeric materials. These particles are hybrids of filler and nanoscale additives because their lengths are macroscopic whereas their cross-sectional dimensions are closer to molecular scales. The combination of extended shape, rigidity and deformability allows CNTs to be mechanically dispersed in polymer matrices in the form of disordered 'jammed' network structures. Our measurements on representative network-forming multiwall nanotube (MWNT) dispersions in polypropylene indicate that these materials exhibit extraordinary flow-induced property changes. Specifically, σ and η both decrease strongly with increasing shear rate, and these nanocomposites exhibit impressively large and negative normal stress differences, a rarely reported phenomenon in soft condensed matter. We illustrate the practical implications of these nonlinear transport properties by showing that MWNTs eliminate die swell in our nanocomposites, an effect crucial for their processing."
1531,Self-assembled single-crystal ferromagnetic iron nanowires formed by decomposition,2004-07-25,"Arrays of perpendicular ferromagnetic nanowires have recently attracted considerable interest for their potential use in many areas of advanced nanotechnology. We report a simple approach to create self-assembled nanowires of α-Fe through the decomposition of a suitably chosen perovskite. We illustrate the principle behind this approach using the reaction 2La0.5Sr0.5FeO3 → LaSrFeO4 + Fe + O2 that occurs during the deposition of La0.5Sr0.5FeO3 under reducing conditions. This leads to the spontaneous formation of an array of single-crystalline α-Fe nanowires embedded in LaSrFeO4 matrix, which grow perpendicular to the substrate and span the entire film thickness. The diameter and spacing of the nanowires are controlled directly by deposition temperature. The nanowires show uniaxial anisotropy normal to the film plane and magnetization close to that of bulk α-Fe. The high magnetization and sizable coercivity of the nanowires make them desirable for high-density data storage and other magnetic-device applications."
1532,Contact-damage-resistant ceramic/single-wall carbon nanotubes and ceramic/graphite composites,2004-07-18,"There has been growing interest in incorporating single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) as toughening agents in brittle ceramics. Here we have prepared dense Al2O3/SWNT composites using the spark-plasma sintering (SPS) method. Vickers (sharp) and Hertzian (blunt) indentation tests reveal that these composites are highly contact-damage resistant, as shown by the lack of crack formation. However, direct toughness measurements, using the single-edge V-notch beam method, show that these composites are as brittle as dense Al2O3 (having a toughness of 3.22 MPa m0.5). This type of unusual mechanical behaviour was also observed in SPS-processed, dense Al2O3/graphite composites. We argue that the highly shear-deformable SWNTs or graphite heterogeneities in the composites help redistribute the stress field under indentation, imparting the composites with contact-damage resistance. These composites may find use in engineering and biomedical applications where contact loading is important."
1533,Surface-mediated gene transfer from nanocomposites of controlled texture,2004-07-18,"Safe and efficient gene delivery would have great potential in gene therapy and tissue engineering, but synthetic biomaterial surfaces endowed with efficient gene-transferring functions do not yet exist. Inspired by naturally occurring biomineralization processes, we co-precipitated DNA with inorganic minerals onto cell-culture surfaces. The DNA/mineral nanocomposite surfaces obtained not only supported cell growth but also provided high concentrations of DNA in the immediate microenvironment of the cultured cells. Gene transfer from the engineered surfaces was as efficient as an optimized commercial lipid transfection reagent; in addition, the extent of gene transfer was adjustable by varying the mineral composition. DNA/mineral nanocomposite surfaces represent a promising system for enhancing gene transfer and controlling the extent of gene transfer for various biomedical applications, including tissue engineering or gene therapy of bone."
1534,Electrochemical epitaxial polymerization of single-molecular wires,2004-07-11,"The fabrication of organized molecular-scale structures is key to realizing high-performance molecular- and conjugated-polymer devices. Here, we demonstrate a unique single-molecular processing technique using electrochemistry, termed 'electrochemical epitaxial polymerization'. This technique is based on step-by-step electropolymerization of the monomer by applying voltage pulses to a monomer–electrolyte solution that also contains iodine. Using this technique, we observe the formation of high-density arrays of single conjugated-polymer wires as long as 75 nm on the surface of a Au(111) electrode. Our findings unveil the mechanism of electropolymerization, showing that the conjugated polymer wires grow from nuclei adsorbed on the iodine-covered Au(111) surface. The results may also open the door to mass-production of molecular-scale devices based on conjugated polymers."
1535,A buckling-based metrology for measuring the elastic moduli of polymeric thin films,2004-07-11,"As technology continues towards smaller, thinner and lighter devices, more stringent demands are placed on thin polymer films as diffusion barriers, dielectric coatings, electronic packaging and so on. Therefore, there is a growing need for testing platforms to rapidly determine the mechanical properties of thin polymer films and coatings. We introduce here an elegant, efficient measurement method that yields the elastic moduli of nanoscale polymer films in a rapid and quantitative manner without the need for expensive equipment or material-specific modelling. The technique exploits a buckling instability that occurs in bilayers consisting of a stiff, thin film coated onto a relatively soft, thick substrate. Using the spacing of these highly periodic wrinkles, we calculate the film's elastic modulus by applying well-established buckling mechanics. We successfully apply this new measurement platform to several systems displaying a wide range of thicknessess (nanometre to micrometre) and moduli (MPa to GPa)."
1536,Single-bonded cubic form of nitrogen,2004-07-04,"Nitrogen usually consists of molecules where two atoms are strongly triple-bonded. Here, we report on an allotropic form of nitrogen where all atoms are connected with single covalent bonds, similar to carbon atoms in diamond. The compound was synthesized directly from molecular nitrogen at temperatures above 2,000 K and pressures above 110 GPa using a laser-heated diamond cell. From X-ray and Raman scattering we have identified this as the long-sought-after polymeric nitrogen with the theoretically predicted cubic gauche structure (cg-N). This cubic phase has not been observed previously in any element. The phase is a stiff substance with bulk modulus ≥300 GPa, characteristic of strong covalent solids. The polymeric nitrogen is metastable, and contrasts with previously reported amorphous non-molecular nitrogen, which is most likely a mixture of small clusters of non-molecular phases. The cg-N represents a new class of single-bonded nitrogen materials with unique properties such as energy capacity: more than five times that of the most powerfully energetic materials."
1537,Toughening of nanoporous glasses using porogen residuals,2004-06-27,"Nanoporous glasses are inherently brittle materials that become increasingly fragile with increasing porosity. We show that remarkable increases in fracture energy can be obtained from remnants of the porogen molecules used to create the nanoscale pores. The interfacial fracture energy of ∼2.6 J m−2 for dense methylsilsesquioxane glass films is shown to increase by over one order of magnitude to >30 J m−2 for glasses containing 50 vol.% porosity. The increased fracture resistance is related to a powerful molecular-bridging mechanism that was modelled using bridging mechanics. The study demonstrates that significant increases in interfacial fracture energy may be obtained using strategies involving controlled decomposition of the porogen molecule during processing of nanoporous glasses. The implications are important for a range of emerging optical, electronic and biological technologies that use nanoporous thin films, but are limited by the degradation of mechanical properties with increasing porosity."
1538,Disordered zinc in Zn,2004-06-27,"By converting waste heat into electricity, thermoelectric generators could be an important part of the solution to today's energy challenges. The compound Zn4Sb3 is one of the most efficient thermoelectric materials known. Its high efficiency results from an extraordinarily low thermal conductivity in conjunction with the electronic structure of a heavily doped semiconductor. Previous structural studies have been unable to explain this unusual combination of properties. Here, we show through a comprehensive structural analysis using single-crystal X-ray and powder-synchrotron-radiation diffraction methods, that both the electronic and thermal properties of Zn4Sb3 can be understood in terms of unique structural features that have been previously overlooked. The identification of Sb3− ions and Sb24− dimers reveals that Zn4Sb3 is a valence semiconductor with the ideal stoichiometry Zn13Sb10. In addition, the structure contains significant disorder, with zinc atoms distributed over multiple positions. The discovery of glass-like interstitial sites uncovers a highly effective mechanism for reducing thermal conductivity. Thus Zn4Sb3 is in many ways an ideal 'phonon glass, electron crystal' thermoelectric material."
1539,Investigation of twin-wall structure at the nanometre scale using atomic force microscopy,2004-06-20,"The structure of twin walls and their interaction with defects has important implications for the behaviour of a variety of materials including ferroelectric, ferroelastic, co-elastic and superconducting crystals. Here, we present a method for investigating the structure of twin walls with nanometre-scale resolution. In this method, the surface topography measured using atomic force microscopy is compared with candidate displacement fields, and this allows for the determination of the twin-wall thickness and other structural features. Moreover, analysis of both complete area images and individual line-scan profiles provides essential information about local mechanisms of twin-wall broadening, which cannot be obtained by existing experimental methods. The method is demonstrated in the ferroelectric material PbTiO3, and it is shown that the accumulation of point defects is responsible for significant broadening of the twin walls. Such defects are of interest because they contribute to the twin-wall kinetics and hysteresis."
1540,Multiphoton microscopy guides neurotrophin modification with poly(ethylene glycol) to enhance interstitial diffusion,2004-06-20,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the limited distribution of this molecule after administration into the brain tissue considerably hampers its efficacy. Here, we show how multiphoton microscopy of fluorescently tagged BDNF in brain-tissue slices provides a useful and rapid screening method for examining the diffusion of large molecules in tissues, and for studying the effects of chemical modifications—for example, conjugating with polyethylene glycol (PEG)—on the diffusion constant. This single variable, obtained by monitoring short-term diffusion in real time, can be effectively used for rational drug design. In this study on fluorescently tagged BDNF and BDNF-PEG, we identify slow diffusion as a major contributing factor to the limited penetration of BDNF, and demonstrate how chemical modification can be used to overcome this barrier."
1541,Biological synthesis of triangular gold nanoprisms,2004-06-20,"The optoelectronic and physicochemical properties of nanoscale matter are a strong function of particle size. Nanoparticle shape also contributes significantly to modulating their electronic properties. Several shapes ranging from rods to wires to plates to teardrop structures may be obtained by chemical methods; triangular nanoparticles have been synthesized by using a seeded growth process. Here, we report the discovery that the extract from the lemongrass plant, when reacted with aqueous chloroaurate ions, yields a high percentage of thin, flat, single-crystalline gold nanotriangles. The nanotriangles seem to grow by a process involving rapid reduction, assembly and room-temperature sintering of 'liquid-like' spherical gold nanoparticles. The anisotropy in nanoparticle shape results in large near-infrared absorption by the particles, and highly anisotropic electron transport in films of the nanotriangles."
1542,The plastic-crystalline phase of succinonitrile as a universal matrix for solid-state ionic conductors,2004-06-13,"Solid ionic conductors are actively sought for their potential application in electrochemical devices, particularly lithium batteries. We have found high ionic conductivity for a large variety of salts dissolved in the highly polar medium based on the plastic-crystal form of succinonitrile (N≡C–CH2–CH2–C≡N). Its high diffusivity, plasticity and solvating power allowed the preparation of a large number of materials with high ionic conductivity, reaching values of 3 mS cm−1 at 25 °C (two orders of magnitude above polymers). Their ease of preparation and processing allowed us to study the influence of the solute on ionic conduction within this medium. Comparisons revealed a dichotomy between plastic crystals and conventional polymer media. The usefulness of these new, easily processed electrolytes was asserted in electrochemical tests with lithium intercalation electrodes."
1543,High-pressure synthesis of crystalline polyethylene using optical catalysis,2004-06-06,"Polymerization processes are probably the most relevant example of a chemical reaction activated by catalysts or radical initiators. Among polymers, polyethylene is by far the most common and largely produced. Here we present a high-pressure synthesis of high-density crystalline polyethylene by using only physical tools such as pressure and light. Low-density polyethylene is obtained by compressing ethylene at room temperature above 3 GPa in the ordered crystal phase, and a highly crystalline polymer is produced in the fluid phase at pressures lower than 1 GPa by using continuous-wave laser lines (λ ≤ 460 nm) as an optical catalyst. The photo-activation is based on a two-photon absorption process to π* antibonding states, where the change in molecular geometry favours the polymeric chain formation. The high yield and crystallinity of the polymer recovered by the photoinduced reaction and the simplicity of the synthesis make this process appealing for large-scale applications."
1544,Direct-bandgap properties and evidence for ultraviolet lasing of hexagonal boron nitride single crystal,2004-05-23,"The demand for compact ultraviolet laser devices is increasing, as they are essential in applications such as optical storage, photocatalysis, sterilization, ophthalmic surgery and nanosurgery. Many researchers are devoting considerable effort to finding materials with larger bandgaps than that of GaN. Here we show that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a promising material for such laser devices because it has a direct bandgap in the ultraviolet region. We obtained a pure hBN single crystal under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, which shows a dominant luminescence peak and a series of s-like exciton absorption bands around 215 nm, proving it to be a direct-bandgap material. Evidence for room-temperature ultraviolet lasing at 215 nm by accelerated electron excitation is provided by the enhancement and narrowing of the longitudinal mode, threshold behaviour of the excitation current dependence of the emission intensity, and a far-field pattern of the transverse mode."
1545,Stacking fault energies and slip in nanocrystalline metals,2004-05-23,"The search for deformation mechanisms in nanocrystalline metals has profited from the use of molecular dynamics calculations. These simulations have revealed two possible mechanisms; grain boundary accommodation, and intragranular slip involving dislocation emission and absorption at grain boundaries. But the precise nature of the slip mechanism is the subject of considerable debate, and the limitations of the simulation technique need to be taken into consideration. Here we show, using molecular dynamics simulations, that the nature of slip in nanocrystalline metals cannot be described in terms of the absolute value of the stacking fault energy—a correct interpretation requires the generalized stacking fault energy curve, involving both stable and unstable stacking fault energies. The molecular dynamics technique does not at present allow for the determination of rate-limiting processes, so the use of our calculations in the interpretation of experiments has to be undertaken with care."
1546,Tailoring ferromagnetic chalcopyrites,2004-05-16,"If magnetic semiconductors are ever to find wide application in real spintronic devices, their magnetic and electronic properties will require tailoring in much the same way that bandgaps are engineered in conventional semiconductors. Unfortunately, no systematic understanding yet exists of how, or even whether, properties such as Curie temperatures and bandgaps are related in magnetic semiconductors. Here we explore theoretically these and other relationships within 64 members of a single materials class, the Mn-doped II-IV-V2 chalcopyrites (where II, IV and V represent elements from groups II, IV and V, respectively); three of these compounds are already known experimentally to be ferromagnetic semiconductors. Our first-principles results reveal a variation of magnetic properties across different materials that cannot be explained by either of the two dominant models of ferromagnetism in semiconductors. On the basis of our results for structural, electronic and magnetic properties, we identify a small number of new stable chalcopyrites with excellent prospects for ferromagnetism."
1547,Spontaneous assembly of subnanometre-ordered domains in the ligand shell of monolayer-protected nanoparticles,2004-04-18,"The properties of materials can be created and improved either by confining their dimensions in the nanoscale or by controlling their nanostructure. We have combined these two concepts, and here we describe a new class of nanostructured nanosized materials that show ordered phase-separated domains at an unprecedented molecular length scale. Scanning tunnelling and transmission electron microscope images of monolayer-protected metal nanoparticles, with ligand shells composed of a mixture of molecules, show that the ligands phase-separate into ordered domains as small as 5 Å. Importantly, the domain shape and dimensions can be controlled by varying the ligand composition or the metallic core size. We demonstrate that the formation of ordered domains depends on the curvature of the underlying substrate, and that novel properties result from this nanostructuring. For example, because the size of the domains is much smaller than the typical dimensions of a protein, these materials are extremely effective in avoiding non-specific adsorption of a variety of proteins."
1548,Thin organic films by atmospheric-pressure ion deposition,2004-04-18,"Interest in thin films of functional organic materials has increased enormously in recent years because of the wide range of possible applications. Here we report an experimental setup for processing various organic materials into thin structured films under atmospheric pressure. The technique is based on an electrospray process. Microdroplets are initially formed and dried, generating ions that are extracted by electrostatic lenses. Thin structured films are then produced by the deposition of the resulting ion beam onto a moveable target. The technique offers several interesting features, including precise control of film thicknesses. We have also made experiments to investigate structured deposition, this being the first step towards the production of thin films where in all three dimensions the chemical composition can be chosen at will. This might provide a simple approach towards creating thin structured films and composites that are currently unattainable."
1549,Self-assembly of a silica–surfactant nanocomposite in a porous alumina membrane,2004-04-11,"A mesoporous membrane composed of nanochannels with a uniform diameter has a potential use for precise size-exclusive separation of molecules. Here, we report a novel method to form a hybrid membrane composed of silica–surfactant nanocomposite and a porous alumina membrane, by which size-selective transport of molecules across the membrane becomes possible. The nanocomposite formed inside each columnar alumina pore was an assembly of surfactant-templated silica-nanochannels with a channel diameter of 3.4 nm; the channel direction being predominantly oriented along the wall of the columnar alumina pore. Molecules could be transported across the membrane including the silica–surfactant nanocomposite with a capability of nanometre-order size-exclusive separation. Our proposed membrane system has a potential use not only for separation science, but also catalysis and chip technologies."
1550,Control of carrier density by self-assembled monolayers in organic field-effect transistors,2004-04-04,"Organic thin-film transistors are attracting a great deal of attention due to the relatively high field-effect mobility in several organic materials. In these organic semiconductors, however, researchers have not established a reliable method of doping at a very low density level, although this has been crucial for the technological development of inorganic semiconductors. In the field-effect device structures, the conduction channel exists at the interface between organic thin films and SiO2 gate insulators. Here, we discuss a new technique that enables us to control the charge density in the channel by using organosilane self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on SiO2 gate insulators. SAMs with fluorine and amino groups have been shown to accumulate holes and electrons, respectively, in the transistor channel: these properties are understood in terms of the effects of electric dipoles of the SAMs molecules, and weak charge transfer between organic films and SAMs."
1551,Collective behaviour in two-dimensional cobalt nanoparticle assemblies observed by magnetic force microscopy,2004-03-28,"The use of magnetic nanoparticles in the development of ultra-high-density recording media is the subject of intense research. Much of the attention of this research is devoted to the stability of magnetic moments, often neglecting the influence of dipolar interactions. Here, we explore the magnetic microstructure of different assemblies of monodisperse cobalt single-domain nanoparticles by magnetic force microscopy and magnetometric measurements. We observe that when the density of particles per unit area is higher than a determined threshold, the two-dimensional self-assemblies behave as a continuous ferromagnetic thin film. Correlated areas (similar to domains) of parallel magnetization roughly ten particles in diameter appear. As this magnetic percolation is mediated by dipolar interactions, the magnetic microstructure, its distribution and stability, is strongly dependent on the topological distribution of the dipoles. Thus, the magnetic structures of three-dimensional assemblies are magnetically soft, and an evolution of the magnetic microstructure is observed with consecutive scans of the microscope tip."
1552,Large anomalous Hall effect in a silicon-based magnetic semiconductor,2004-03-21,"Magnetic semiconductors are attracting great interest because of their potential use for spintronics, a new technology that merges electronics with the manipulation of conduction electron spins. (GaMn)As and (GaMn)N have recently emerged as the most popular materials for this new technology, and although their Curie temperatures are rising towards room temperature, these materials can only be fabricated in thin-film form, are heavily defective, and are not obviously compatible with Si. We show here that it is productive to consider transition metal monosilicides as potential alternatives. In particular, we report the discovery that the bulk metallic magnets derived from doping the narrow-gap insulator FeSi with Co share the very high anomalous Hall conductance of (GaMn)As, while displaying Curie temperatures as high as 53 K. Our work opens up a new arena for spintronics, involving a bulk material based only on transition metals and Si, which displays large magnetic-field effects on its electrical properties."
1553,The route to fullerenoid oxides,2004-03-07,"Tetrahedral oxides, like silicates and aluminates, have attracted great interest due to their potential for numerous applications in various fields ranging from catalysis, ion exchange and molecular sieves, to thermo- and photoluminescence. In spite of their tetrahedral character, no effort has been made to date for establishing structural relationships between these tetrahedral oxides with different forms of carbon, for example, fullerenes. Here, we report for the first time an oxide that exhibits a three-dimensional framework of AlO4 tetrahedra forming huge 'Al84' spheres, similar to those of the D2d isomer of the C84 fullerenes. These Al84 spheres, displayed in a face-centred-cubic lattice, are easily identified by high-resolution electron microscopy. We also show that this Sr33Bi24+δAl48O141+3δ/2 aluminate exhibits an onion-skin-like subnanostructure of its Bi/Sr/O species located inside the Al84 spheres. The role of the original pseudo-spheric anion [Bi16O52−n□n] —with n vacancies (□)—in the stabilization of such a structure is discussed. This structure seems to be promising for the generation of a large family of fullerene-type (fullerenoid) oxides with various properties."
1554,The origin of ferroelectricity in magnetoelectric YMnO,2004-02-22,"Understanding the ferroelectrocity in magnetic ferroelectric oxides is of both fundamental and technological importance. Here, we identify the nature of the ferroelectric phase transition in the hexagonal manganite, YMnO3, using a combination of single-crystal X-ray diffraction, thorough structure analysis and first-principles density-functional calculations. The ferroelectric phase is characterized by a buckling of the layered MnO5 polyhedra, accompanied by displacements of the Y ions, which lead to a net electric polarization. Our calculations show that the mechanism is driven entirely by electrostatic and size effects, rather than the usual changes in chemical bonding associated with ferroelectric phase transitions in perovskite oxides. As a result, the usual indicators of structural instability, such as anomalies in Born effective charges on the active ions, do not hold. In contrast to the chemically stabilized ferroelectrics, this mechanism for ferroelectricity permits the coexistence of magnetism and ferroelectricity, and so suggests an avenue for designing novel magnetic ferroelectrics."
1555,Self-assembled liquid-crystalline gels designed from the bottom up,2004-02-15,"Liquid crystals are often combined with polymers to influence the liquid crystals' orientation and mechanical properties, but at the expense of reorientation speed or uniformity of alignment. We introduce a new method to create self-assembled nematic liquid-crystal gels using an ABA triblock copolymer with a side-group liquid-crystalline midblock and liquid-crystal-phobic endblocks. In contrast to in situ polymerized networks, these physical gels are homogeneous systems with a solubilized polymer network giving them exceptional optical uniformity and well-defined crosslink density. Furthermore, the unusually high-molecular-weight polymers used allow gels to form at lower concentrations than previously accessible. This enables these gels to be aligned by surface anchoring, shear, or magnetic fields. The high content of small-molecule liquid crystal (≥95%) allows access to a regime of fast reorientation dynamics."
1556,Reinforcement of single-walled carbon nanotube bundles by intertube bridging,2004-02-15,"During their production, single-walled carbon nanotubes form bundles. Owing to the weak van der Waals interaction that holds them together in the bundle, the tubes can easily slide on each other, resulting in a shear modulus comparable to that of graphite. This low shear modulus is also a major obstacle in the fabrication of macroscopic fibres composed of carbon nanotubes. Here, we have introduced stable links between neighbouring carbon nanotubes within bundles, using moderate electron-beam irradiation inside a transmission electron microscope. Concurrent measurements of the mechanical properties using an atomic force microscope show a 30-fold increase of the bending modulus, due to the formation of stable crosslinks that effectively eliminate sliding between the nanotubes. Crosslinks were modelled using first-principles calculations, showing that interstitial carbon atoms formed during irradiation in addition to carboxyl groups, can independently lead to bridge formation between neighbouring nanotubes."
1557,Molecularly engineered poly(ortho ester) microspheres for enhanced delivery of DNA vaccines,2004-02-15,"Genetic vaccination using plasmid DNA presents a unique opportunity for achieving potent immune responses without the potential limitations of many conventional vaccines. Here we report the design of synthetic biodegradable polymers specifically for enhancing DNA vaccine efficacy in vivo. We molecularly engineered poly(ortho ester) microspheres that are non-toxic to cells, protect DNA from degradation, enable uptake by antigen-presenting cells, and release DNA rapidly in response to phagosomal pH. One type of microsphere of poly(ortho esters) that releases DNA vaccines in synchrony with the natural development of adaptive immunity, elicited distinct primary and secondary humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and suppressed the growth of tumour cells bearing a model antigen. This polymer microparticulate system could, with further study, have implications for advancing the clinical utility of DNA vaccines as well as other nucleic-acid-based therapeutics against viral infections and cancer."
1558,Oxidation-responsive polymeric vesicles,2004-02-15,"Vesicles formed in water by synthetic macro-amphiphiles have attracted much attention as nanocontainers having properties that extend the physical and chemical limits of liposomes. We sought to develop ABA block copolymeric amphiphiles that self-assemble into unilamellar vesicles that can be further oxidatively destabilized. We selected poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as the hydrophilic A blocks, owing to its resistance to protein adsorption and low toxicity. As hydrophobic B blocks, we selected poly(propylene sulphide) (PPS), owing to its extreme hydrophobicity, its low glass-transition temperature, and most importantly its oxidative conversion from a hydrophobe to a hydrophile, poly(propylene sulphoxide) and ultimately poly(propylene sulphone). This is the first example of the use of oxidative conversions to destabilize such carriers. This new class of oxidation-responsive polymeric vesicles may find applications as nanocontainers in drug delivery, biosensing and biodetection."
1559,Dynamic transitions from smooth to rough to twinning in dislocation motion,2004-02-08,"The motion of dislocations in response to stress dictates the mechanical behaviour of materials. However, it is not yet possible to directly observe dislocation motion experimentally at the atomic level. Here, we present the first observations of the long-hypothesized kink-pair mechanism in action using atomistic simulations of dislocation motion in iron. In a striking deviation from the classical picture, dislocation motion at high strain rates becomes rough, resulting in spontaneous self-pinning and production of large quantities of debris. Then, at still higher strain rates, the dislocation stops abruptly and emits a twin plate that immediately takes over as the dominant mode of plastic deformation. These observations challenge the applicability of the Peierls threshold concept to the three-dimensional motion of screw dislocations at high strain rates, and suggest a new interpretation of plastic strength and microstructure of shocked metals."
1560,Dewetting of conducting polymer inkjet droplets on patterned surfaces,2004-02-08,"The manufacture of high-performance electronic devices with micrometre or even submicrometre dimensions by solution processing and direct printing, requires the ability to control accurately the flow and spread of functional liquid inks on surfaces. This can be achieved with the help of surface-energy patterns causing inks to be repelled and dewetted from pre-defined regions of the substrate. To exploit this principle for the fabrication of submicrometre device structures, a detailed understanding of the factors causing ink droplets to dewet on patterned surfaces is required. Here, we use hydrophobic surface-energy barriers of different geometries to study the influence of solution viscosity, ink volume, and contact angle on the process of dewetting of inkjet-printed droplets of a water-based conducting polymer. We demonstrate polymer field-effect transistor devices with channel length of 500 nm fabricated by surface-energy-assisted inkjet printing."
1561,Van der Waals versus dipolar forces controlling mesoscopic organizations of magnetic nanocrystals,2004-01-18,"The structure, thermodynamics and dynamics in many physical and chemical systems are determined by interplay of short-range isotropic and long-range anisotropic forces. Magnetic nanoparticles dispersed in solution are ideal model systems to study this interplay, as they are subjected to both isotropic van der Waals and anisotropic dipolar forces. Here we show from experiment an abrupt transition of maghemite nanocrystal organization from chain-like to random structures when nanoparticle solutions are evaporated under a magnetic field. This is explained by brownian dynamics simulations in terms of a variation of the strength of van der Waals interactions with the particle contact distance, which is tuned by the length of the molecules coating the particles. The weak dipole–dipole interactions between the maghemite particles are usually not sufficient to result in the chain formation observed here. However, due to the van der Waals interactions, when the nanocrystal contact distance is short enough, clusters of nanocrystals are formed during the evaporation process. These clusters exhibit large dipole moments compared with a single particle, which explains the formation of chain-like structures. Conversely, when the nanocrystal contact distance is too long, no nanocrystal aggregation occurs, and a random distribution of maghemite nanocrystals is obtained."
1562,Design and synthesis of self-ordered mesoporous nanocomposite through controlled ,2003-12-21,"Mesoporous materials are of technological interest because of their applications ranging from catalysts, molecular sieves, separation technology and gas sensors, to batteries and electronics1,2,3,4. Here we demonstrate a synthetic methodology that allows us to create an ordered mesoporous nanocomposite with a crystalline oxide framework. We design a 'nanocrystal–glass' configuration to build a nanoarchitecture by means of surfactant-templated self-assembly followed by the controlled in-situ crystallization of materials. Functional nanocrystals are used as the building blocks of ordered mesopores, and the glass phase can act both as the 'glue' between nanocrystals and as a functionalized component in the composites. Specifically, we demonstrate this methodology for ordered mesoporous nanocomposites consisting of electrochemically active nanocrystals and semiconductive glass in the TiO2–P2O5–MxOy systems (where M is a metal ion). This approach could be applied to many other multicomponent oxides to fabricate mesoporous nanocomposites for numerous uses."
1563,Deformation-mechanism map for nanocrystalline metals by molecular-dynamics simulation,2003-12-14,"Molecular-dynamics simulations have recently been used to elucidate the transition with decreasing grain size from a dislocation-based to a grain-boundary-based deformation mechanism in nanocrystalline f.c.c. metals. This transition in the deformation mechanism results in a maximum yield strength at a grain size (the 'strongest size') that depends strongly on the stacking-fault energy, the elastic properties of the metal, and the magnitude of the applied stress. Here, by exploring the role of the stacking-fault energy in this crossover, we elucidate how the size of the extended dislocations nucleated from the grain boundaries affects the mechanical behaviour. Building on the fundamental physics of deformation as exposed by these simulations, we propose a two-dimensional stress-grain size deformation-mechanism map for the mechanical behaviour of nanocrystalline f.c.c. metals at low temperature. The map captures this transition in both the deformation mechanism and the related mechanical behaviour with decreasing grain size, as well as its dependence on the stacking-fault energy, the elastic properties of the material, and the applied stress level."
1564,"Charge, orbital and spin ordering phenomena in the mixed valence manganite (NaMn",2003-12-14,"Mixed-valence manganites with the ABO3 perovskite structure display a variety of magnetic and structural transitions, dramatic changes of electrical conductivity and magnetoresistance effects. The physical properties vary with the relative concentration of Mn3+ and Mn4+ in the octahedral corner-sharing network, and the proportion of these two cations is usually changed by doping the trivalent large A cation (for example, La3+) with divalent cations. As the dopant and the original cation have, in general, different sizes, and as they are distributed randomly in the structure, such systems are characterized by local distortions that make it difficult to obtain direct information about their crystallographic and physical properties. On the other hand, the double oxides of formula AA′3Mn4O12 contain a perovskite-like network of oxygen octahedra centred on the Mn cations, coupled with an ordered arrangement of the A and A′ cations, whose valences control the proportion of Mn3+ and Mn4+ in the structure. The compound investigated in this work, (NaMn3+3)(Mn3+2Mn4+2)O12, contains an equal number of Mn3+ and Mn4+ in the octahedral sites. We show that the absence of disorder enables the unambiguous determination of symmetry, the direct observation of full, or nearly full, charge ordering of Mn3+ and Mn4+ in distinct crystallographic sites, and a nearly perfect orbital ordering of the Mn3+ octahedra."
1565,Fracture of nanoporous thin-film glasses,2003-12-07,"Fracture of nanoporous thin-film glasses is a significant challenge for the integration of these mechanically fragile materials in emerging microelectronic and biological technologies. In particular, the integration of these materials has been limited by accelerated cracking rates in moist environments leading to premature failure. Here, we demonstrate how cracking is affected by aqueous solution chemistry, and reveal anomalously high crack-growth rates in hydrogen peroxide solutions frequently encountered during device processing or when in use. Kinetic mechanisms involving the transport and steric hindrance of reactive hydrogen peroxide molecules at the crack tip are proposed. Thin-film design strategies that involve energy dissipation by local plasticity in thin ductile layers on increasing the resistance to cracking of nanoporous glass layers is demonstrated. Understanding how aqueous solutions influence cracking and associated device reliability is a fundamental challenge for these promising materials to be viable candidates for new technologies."
1566,Semi-wet peptide/protein array using supramolecular hydrogel,2003-12-07,"The protein microarray is a crucial biomaterial for the rapid and high-throughput assay of many biological events where proteins are involved. In contrast to the DNA microarray, it has not been sufficiently established because of protein instability under the conventional dry conditions. Here we report a novel semi-wet peptide/protein microarray using a supramolecular hydrogel composed of glycosylated amino acetate. The spontaneous gel-formation and amphiphilic properties of this supramolecular hydrogel have been applied to a new type of peptide/protein gel array that is compatible with enzyme assays. Aqueous cavities created in the gel matrix are a suitable semi-wet reaction medium for enzymes, whereas the hydrophobic domains of the fibre are useful as a unique site for monitoring the reaction. This array system overcomes several drawbacks of conventional protein chips, and thus can have potential applications in pharmaceutical research and diagnosis."
1567,Complex and oriented ZnO nanostructures,2003-11-23,"Extended and oriented nanostructures are desirable for many applications, but direct fabrication of complex nanostructures with controlled crystalline morphology, orientation and surface architectures remains a significant challenge. Here we report a low-temperature, environmentally benign, solution-based approach for the preparation of complex and oriented ZnO nanostructures, and the systematic modification of their crystal morphology. Using controlled seeded growth and citrate anions that selectively adsorb on ZnO basal planes as the structure-directing agent, we prepared large arrays of oriented ZnO nanorods with controlled aspect ratios, complex film morphologies made of oriented nanocolumns and nanoplates (remarkably similar to biomineral structures in red abalone shells) and complex bilayers showing in situ column-to-rod morphological transitions. The advantages of some of these ZnO structures for photocatalytic decompositions of volatile organic compounds were demonstrated. The novel ZnO nanostructures are expected to have great potential for sensing, catalysis, optical emission, piezoelectric transduction, and actuations."
1568,"Hydrocarbon analogues of boron clusters — planarity, aromaticity and antiaromaticity",2003-11-09,"An interesting feature of elemental boron and boron compounds is the occurrence of highly symmetric icosahedral clusters. The rich chemistry of boron is also dominated by three-dimensional cage structures. Despite its proximity to carbon in the periodic table, elemental boron clusters have been scarcely studied experimentally and their structures and chemical bonding have not been fully elucidated. Here we report experimental and theoretical evidence that small boron clusters prefer planar structures and exhibit aromaticity and antiaromaticity according to the Hückel rules, akin to planar hydrocarbons. Aromatic boron clusters possess more circular shapes whereas antiaromatic boron clusters are elongated, analogous to structural distortions of antiaromatic hydrocarbons. The planar boron clusters are thus the only series of molecules other than the hydrocarbons to exhibit size-dependent aromatic and antiaromatic behaviour and represent a new dimension of boron chemistry. The stable aromatic boron clusters may exhibit similar chemistries to that of benzene, such as forming sandwich-type metal compounds."
1569,Atomic layer deposition of transition metals,2003-10-26,"Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a process for depositing highly uniform and conformal thin films by alternating exposures of a surface to vapours of two chemical reactants. ALD processes have been successfully demonstrated for many metal compounds, but for only very few pure metals. Here we demonstrate processes for the ALD of transition metals including copper, cobalt, iron and nickel. Homoleptic N,N′-dialkylacetamidinato metal compounds and molecular hydrogen gas were used as the reactants. Their surface reactions were found to be complementary and self-limiting, thus providing highly uniform thicknesses and conformal coating of long, narrow holes. We propose that these ALD layers grow by a hydrogenation mechanism that should also operate during the ALD of many other metals. The use of water vapour in place of hydrogen gas gives highly uniform, conformal films of metal oxides, including lanthanum oxide. These processes should permit the improved production of many devices for which the ALD process has previously not been applicable."
1570,A reversible copper extrusion–insertion electrode for rechargeable Li batteries,2003-10-26,"Although widely used, the most promising Li-based technologies still suffer from a lack of suitable electrodes. There is therefore a need to seek new materials concepts to satisfy the increasing demands for energy storage worldwide. Here we report on a new layered electrode material, Cu2.33V4O11, which shows a sustainable reversible capacity of 270 mA h g−1 at a voltage of about 2.7 V, and electrochemically reacts with Li in an unusual and spectacular way. The reaction entails a reversible Li-driven displacement process leading to the growth and disappearance of Cu dendrites with a concomitant reversible decomposition and recrystallization of the initial electrode material. We show from structural considerations that the uniqueness of Cu2.33V4O11 is rooted in the peculiar flexibility of the stacked [V4O11]n layers, which is due to the presence of pivot oxygen atoms. Fully reversible displacement reactions could provide a new direction for developing an alternative class of higher energy density Li storage electrodes."
1571,Multi-pulse drug delivery from a resorbable polymeric microchip device,2003-10-19,"Controlled-release drug delivery systems have many applications, including treatments for hormone deficiencies and chronic pain. A biodegradable device that could provide multi-dose drug delivery would be advantageous for long-term treatment of conditions requiring pulsatile drug release. In this work, biodegradable polymeric microchips were fabricated that released four pulses of radiolabelled dextran, human growth hormone or heparin in vitro. Heparin that was released over 142 days retained on average 96 ± 12% of its bioactivity. The microchips were 1.2 cm in diameter, 480–560 μm thick and had 36 reservoirs that could each be filled with a different chemical. The devices were fabricated from poly(L-lactic acid) and had poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) membranes of different molecular masses covering the reservoirs. A drug delivery system can be designed with the potential to release pulses of different drugs at intervals after implantation in a patient by using different molecular masses or materials for the membrane."
1572,Nanoscale effects leading to non-Einstein-like decrease in viscosity,2003-10-19,"Nanoparticles have been shown to influence mechanical properties; however, transport properties such as viscosity have not been adequately studied. This might be due to the common observation that particle addition to liquids produces an increase in viscosity, even in polymeric liquids, as predicted by Einstein nearly a century ago. But confinement and surface effects provided by nanoparticles have been shown to produce conformational changes to polymer molecules, so it is expected that nanoparticles will affect the macroscopic viscosity. To minimize extraneous enthalpic or other effects, we blended organic nanoparticles, synthesized by intramolecular crosslinking of single polystyrene chains, with linear polystyrene macromolecules. Remarkably, the blend viscosity was found to decrease and scale with the change in free volume introduced by the nanoparticles and not with the decrease in entanglement. Indeed, the entanglements did not seem to be affected at all, suggesting unusual polymer dynamics."
1573,Solution-processed ambipolar organic field-effect transistors and inverters,2003-09-21,"There is ample evidence that organic field-effect transistors have reached a stage where they can be industrialized, analogous to standard metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistors. Monocrystalline silicon technology is largely based on complementary MOS (CMOS) structures that use both n-type and p-type transistor channels. This complementary technology has enabled the construction of digital circuits, which operate with a high robustness, low power dissipation and a good noise margin. For the design of efficient organic integrated circuits, there is an urgent need for complementary technology, where both n-type and p-type transistor operation is realized in a single layer, while maintaining the attractiveness of easy solution processing. We demonstrate, by using solution-processed field-effect transistors, that hole transport and electron transport are both generic properties of organic semiconductors. This ambipolar transport is observed in polymers based on interpenetrating networks as well as in narrow bandgap organic semiconductors. We combine the organic ambipolar transistors into functional CMOS-like inverters."
1574,Ferromagnetism above room temperature in bulk and transparent thin films of Mn-doped ZnO,2003-09-21,"The search for ferromagnetism above room temperature in dilute magnetic semiconductors has been intense in recent years. We report the first observations of ferromagnetism above room temperature for dilute (<4 at.%) Mn-doped ZnO. The Mn is found to carry an average magnetic moment of 0.16 μB per ion. Our ab initio calculations find a valance state of Mn2+ and that the magnetic moments are ordered ferromagnetically, consistent with the experimental findings. We have obtained room-temperature ferromagnetic ordering in bulk pellets, in transparent films 2–3 μm thick, and in the powder form of the same material. The unique feature of our sample preparation was the low-temperature processing. When standard high-temperature (T > 700 °C) methods were used, samples were found to exhibit clustering and were not ferromagnetic at room temperature. This capability to fabricate ferromagnetic Mn-doped ZnO semiconductors promises new spintronic devices as well as magneto-optic components."
1575,Assembling a lasing hybrid material with supramolecular polymers and nanocrystals,2003-09-21,"The combination of bottom-up and top-down processes to organize nanophases in hybrid materials is a key strategy to create functional materials. We found that oxide and sulphide nanocrystals become spontaneously dispersed in organic media during the self-assembly of nanoribbon supramolecular polymers. These nanoribbon polymers form by self-assembly of dendron rodcoil molecules, which contain three molecular blocks with dendritic, rod-like, and coil-like architectures. In an electric field these supramolecular assemblies carrying bound nanocrystals migrate to the positive electrode in an etched channel and align in the field. In the system containing ZnO nanocrystals as the inorganic component, both phases are oriented in the hybrid material forming an ultraviolet lasing medium with a lower threshold relative to pure ZnO nanocrystals."
1576,The distribution of glass-transition temperatures in nanoscopically confined glass formers,2003-09-21,"Despite the decade-long study of the effect of nanoconfinement on the glass-transition temperature (Tg) of amorphous materials, the quest to probe the distribution of Tgs in nanoconfined glass formers has remained unfulfilled. Here the distribution of Tgs across polystyrene films has been obtained by a fluorescence/multilayer method, revealing that the enhancement of dynamics at a surface affects Tg several tens of nanometres into the film. The extent to which dynamics smoothly transition from enhanced to bulk states depends strongly on nanoconfinement. When polymer films are sufficiently thin that a reduction in thickness leads to a reduction in overall Tg, the surface-layer Tg actually increases with a reduction in overall thickness, whereas the substrate-layer Tg decreases. These results indicate that the gradient in Tg dynamics is not abrupt, and that the size of a cooperatively rearranging region is much smaller than the distance over which interfacial effects propagate."
1577,Stable and controlled amphoteric doping by encapsulation of organic molecules inside carbon nanotubes,2003-09-07,"Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have strong potential for molecular electronics, owing to their unique structural and electronic properties. However, various outstanding issues still need to be resolved before SWNT-based devices can be made. In particular, large-scale, air-stable and controlled doping is highly desirable. Here we present a method for integrating organic molecules into SWNTs that promises to push the performance limit of these materials for molecular electronics. Reaction of SWNTs with molecules having large electron affinity and small ionization energy achieved p- and n-type doping, respectively. Optical characterization revealed that charge transfer between SWNTs and molecules starts at certain critical energies. X-ray diffraction experiments revealed that molecules are predominantly encapsulated inside SWNTs, resulting in an improved stability in air. The simplicity of the synthetic process offers a viable route for the large-scale production of SWNTs with controlled doping states."
1578,DNA molecules and configurations in a solid-state nanopore microscope,2003-08-24,"A nanometre-scale pore in a solid-state membrane provides a new way of electronically probing the structure of single linear polymers, including those of biological interest in their native environments. Previous work with biological protein pores wide enough to let through and sense single-stranded DNA molecules demonstrates the power of using nanopores, but many future tasks and applications call for a robust solid-state pore whose nanometre-scale dimensions and properties may be selected, as one selects the lenses of a microscope. Here we demonstrate a solid-state nanopore microscope capable of observing individual molecules of double-stranded DNA and their folding behaviour. We discuss extensions of the nanopore microscope concept to alternative probing mechanisms and applications, including the study of molecular structure and sequencing."
1579,Self-assembled nanoscale biosensors based on quantum dot FRET donors,2003-08-24,"The potential of luminescent semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) to enable development of hybrid inorganic-bioreceptor sensing materials has remained largely unrealized. We report the design, formation and testing of QD–protein assemblies that function as chemical sensors. In these assemblies, multiple copies of Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) coordinate to each QD by a C-terminal oligohistidine segment and function as sugar receptors. Sensors are self-assembled in solution in a controllable manner. In one configuration, a β-cyclodextrin-QSY9 dark quencher conjugate bound in the MBP saccharide binding site results in fluorescence resonance energy-transfer (FRET) quenching of QD photoluminescence. Added maltose displaces the β-cyclodextrin-QSY9, and QD photoluminescence increases in a systematic manner. A second maltose sensor assembly consists of QDs coupled with Cy3-labelled MBP bound to β-cyclodextrin-Cy3.5. In this case, the QD donor drives sensor function through a two-step FRET mechanism that overcomes inherent QD donor–acceptor distance limitations. Quantum dot–biomolecule assemblies constructed using these methods may facilitate development of new hybrid sensing materials."
1580,The rheology of collapsing zeolites amorphized by temperature and pressure,2003-08-24,"Low-density zeolites collapse to the rigid amorphous state at temperatures that are well below the melting points of crystals of the same composition but of conventional density. Here we show, by using a range of experimental techniques, how the phenomenon of amorphization is time dependent, and how the dynamics of order–disorder transitions in zeolites under temperature and pressure are equivalent. As a result, thermobaric regions of instability can be charted, which are indicative of polyamorphism. Moreover, the boundaries of these zones depend on the rate at which temperature or pressure is ramped. By directly comparing the rheology of collapse with structural relaxation in equivalent melts, we conclude that zeolites amorphize like very strong liquids and, if compression occurs slowly, this is likely to lead to the synthesis of perfect glasses."
1581,Correlating structure with fluorescence emission in phase-separated conjugated-polymer blends,2003-08-17,"Blends of conjugated polymers are frequently used as the active semiconducting layer in light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic devices. Here we report the use of scanning near-field optical microscopy, scanning force microscopy and nuclear-reaction analysis to study the structure of a thin film of a phase-separated blend of two conjugated polymers prepared by spin-casting. We show that in addition to the well-known micrometre-scale phase-separated morphology of the blend, one of the polymers preferentially wets the surface and forms a 10-nm-thick, partially crystallized wetting layer. Using near-field microscopy we identify unexpected changes in the fluorescence emission from the blend that occurs in a 300-nm-wide band located at the interface between the different phase-separated domains. Our measurements provide an insight into the complex structure of phase-separated conjugated-polymer thin films. Characterizing and controlling the properties of the interfaces in such films will be critical in the further development of efficient optoelectronic devices."
1582,The Mott–Hubbard insulating state and orbital degeneracy in the superconducting C,2003-08-10,"Electron correlation controls the properties of important materials such as superconducting and magnetoresistive transition metal oxides and heavy fermion systems. The role of correlation in driving metal-to-insulator transitions assumes further importance because many superconducting materials are located close to such transitions. The nature of the insulating ground state often reveals the dominant interactions in the superconductor, as shown by the importance of the properties of La2CuO4 in understanding the high-temperature-superconducting cuprates. The A3C60 alkali metal fullerides are superconducting systems in which the role of correlation in both the normal state and the superconducting pairing mechanism is controversial, because no magnetic insulator comparable to the superconducting materials has been identified. We describe the first example of a cubic C603− system with degenerate orbitals that adopts the Mott–Hubbard insulating localized electron ground state. Electron repulsion is identified as the interaction that is suppressed on the transition to metallic and superconducting behaviour in the fullerides. This observation is combined with ab initio calculations to demonstrate that it is the orbital degeneracy that allows the superconducting cubic A3C60 fullerides to remain metallic while provoking electron localization in systems with lower symmetry."
1583,The remarkable difference between surface and step atoms in the magnetic anisotropy of two-dimensional nanostructures,2003-07-27,"The original magnetic properties of nanometre-sized particles are due to the distinct contributions of volume, surface and step atoms. To disentangle these contributions is an ongoing challenge of materials science. Here we introduce a method enabling the identification of the remarkably different contributions of surface and perimeter atoms to the magnetic anisotropy energy of two-dimensional nanostructures. Our method uses the generally nonlinear relationship between perimeter length and surface area. Atomic-scale characterization of the morphology of ensembles of polydisperse nanostructures, combined with in situ measurements of their temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, gives access to the role played by the differently coordinated atoms. We show for Co nanostructures on a Pt(111) surface that their uniaxial out-of-plane magnetization is entirely caused by edge atoms having 20 times more anisotropy energy than their bulk and surface counterparts. Identification of the role of perimeter and surface atoms opens up unprecedented opportunities for materials engineering. As an example, we separately tune magnetic hardness and moment in bimetallic core–shell nanostructures."
1584,Nucleation of apatite crystals ,2003-07-20,"Bones and teeth are biocomposites that require controlled mineral deposition during their self-assembly to form tissues with unique mechanical properties. Acidic extracellular matrix proteins play a pivotal role during biomineral formation. However, the mechanisms of protein-mediated mineral initiation are far from understood. Here we report that dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), an acidic protein, can nucleate the formation of hydroxyapatite in vitro in a multistep process that begins by DMP1 binding calcium ions and initiating mineral deposition. The nucleated amorphous calcium phosphate precipitates ripen and nanocrystals form. Subsequently, these expand and coalesce into microscale crystals elongated in the c-axis direction. Characterization of the functional domains in DMP1 demonstrated that intermolecular assembly of acidic clusters into a β-sheet template was essential for the observed mineral nucleation. Protein-mediated initiation of nanocrystals, as discussed here, might provide a new methodology for constructing nanoscale composites by self-assembly of polypeptides with tailor-made peptide sequences."
1585,Identification of ultradilute dopants in ceramics,2003-07-13,"The properties of ceramic materials are strongly influenced by the presence of ultradilute impurities (dopants). Near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) measurements using third-generation synchotron sources can be used to identify ultradilute dopants, provided that a good theoretical tool is available to interpret the spectra. Here, we use NEXAFS analysis and first-principles calculations to study the local environments of Ga dopants at levels of 10 p.p.m in otherwise high-purity MgO. This analysis suggests that the extra charge associated with substitutional Ga on a Mg site is compensated by the formation of a Mg vacancy. This defect model is then confirmed by positron lifetime measurements and plane-wave pseudopotential calculations. This powerful combination of techniques should provide a general method of identifying the defect states of ultradilute dopants in ceramics."
1586,Shallow donors with high n-type electrical conductivity in homoepitaxial deuterated boron-doped diamond layers,2003-06-22,"Diamond is a unique semiconductor for the fabrication of electronic and opto-electronic devices because of its exceptional physical and chemical properties. However, a serious obstacle to the realization of diamond-based devices is the lack of n-type diamond with satisfactory electrical properties. Here we show that high-conductivity n-type diamond can be achieved by deuteration of particularly selected homo-epitaxially grown (100) boron-doped diamond layers. Deuterium diffusion through the entire boron-doped layer leads to the passivation of the boron acceptors and to the conversion from highly p-type to n-type conductivity due to the formation of shallow donors with ionization energy of 0.23 eV. Electrical conductivities as high as 2 Ω−1 cm−1 with electron mobilities of the order of a few hundred cm2 V−1 s−1 are measured at 300 K for samples with electron concentrations of several 1016 cm−3. The formation and break-up of deuterium-related complexes, due to some excess deuterium in the deuterated layer, seem to be responsible for the reversible p- to n-type conversion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such an effect has been observed in an elemental semiconductor."
1587,Tearing transition and plastic flow in superconducting thin films,2003-06-22,"A new class of artificial atoms, such as synthetic nanocrystals or vortices in superconductors, naturally self-assemble into ordered arrays. This property makes them applicable to the design of novel solids, and devices whose properties often depend on the response of such assemblies to the action of external forces. Here we study the transport properties of a vortex array in the Corbino disk geometry by numerical simulations. In response to an injected current in the superconductor, the global resistance associated to vortex motion exhibits sharp jumps at two threshold current values. The first corresponds to a tearing transition from rigid rotation to plastic flow, due to the reiterative nucleation around the disk centre of neutral dislocation pairs that unbind and glide across the entire disk. After the second jump, we observe a smoother plastic phase proceeding from the coherent glide of a larger number of dislocations arranged into radial grain boundaries."
1588,"A zeolite with interconnected 8-, 10- and 12-ring pores and its unique catalytic selectivity",2003-06-22,"One of the major goals in catalysis is to improve the capabilities of microporous materials. This can be accomplished by synthesizing new zeolites with controlled pore architectures. In particular, zeolites containing channels of different sizes in the same structure are desirable. Here, we report a zeolite containing fully interconnected 8-, 10- and 12-membered-ring pores, synthesized by combining the structure-directing effect of the organic 1,5-bis-(methylpyrrolidinium)-pentane and the framework isomorphic substitution of germanium for silicon. Analysis of the crystal structure determined by direct methods from synchrotron powder diffraction data reveals 16 independent tetrahedrally coordinated atoms. This thermally and hydrothermally stable zeolite structure, when synthesized in its acidic form by incorporating aluminium in the framework, presents unique catalytic shape-selectivity effects derived from its particular pore topology."
1589,X-ray microdiffraction study of growth modes and crystallographic tilts in oxide films on metal substrates,2003-06-08,"The crystallographic texture of thin-film coatings plays an essential role in determining such diverse materials properties as wear resistance, recording density in magnetic media and electrical transport in superconductors. Typically, X-ray pole figures provide a macroscopically averaged description of texture, and electron backscattering provides spatially resolved surface measurements. In this study, we have used focused, polychromatic synchrotron X-ray microbeams to penetrate multilayer materials and simultaneously characterize the local structure, orientation and strain tensor of different heteroepitaxial layers with submicrometre resolution. Grain-by-grain microstructural studies of cerium oxide films grown on textured nickel foils reveal two distinct kinetic growth regimes on vicinal surfaces: ledge growth at elevated temperatures and island growth at lower temperatures. In addition, a combinatorial approach reveals that crystallographic tilting associated with these complex interfaces is qualitatively described by a simple geometrical model applicable to brittle films on ductile substrates. The sensitivity of conducting percolation paths to tilt-induced texture improvement is demonstrated."
1590,Nanostructured artificial nacre,2003-05-25,"Finding a synthetic pathway to artificial analogs of nacre and bones represents a fundamental milestone in the development of composite materials. The ordered brick-and-mortar arrangement of organic and inorganic layers is believed to be the most essential strength- and toughness-determining structural feature of nacre. It has also been found that the ionic crosslinking of tightly folded macromolecules is equally important. Here, we demonstrate that both structural features can be reproduced by sequential deposition of polyelectrolytes and clays. This simple process results in a nanoscale version of nacre with alternating organic and inorganic layers. The macromolecular folding effect reveals itself in the unique saw-tooth pattern of differential stretching curves attributed to the gradual breakage of ionic crosslinks in polyelectrolyte chains. The tensile strength of the prepared multilayers approached that of nacre, whereas their ultimate Young modulus was similar to that of lamellar bones. Structural and functional resemblance makes clay– polyelectrolyte multilayers a close replica of natural biocomposites. Their nanoscale nature enables elucidation of molecular processes occurring under stress."
1591,Pinpoint and bulk electrochemical reduction of insulating silicon dioxide to silicon,2003-05-18,"Silicon dioxide (SiO2) is conventionally reduced to silicon by carbothermal reduction, in which the oxygen is removed by a heterogeneous–homogeneous reaction sequence at approximately 1,700 °C. Here we report pinpoint and bulk electrochemical methods for removing oxygen from solid SiO2 in a molten CaCl2 electrolyte at 850 °C. This approach involves a 'contacting electrode', in which a metal wire supplies electrons to a selected region of the insulating SiO2. Bulk reduction of SiO2 is possible by increasing the number of contacting points. The same method was also demonstrated with molten LiCl-KCl-CaCl2 at 500 °C. The novelty and relative simplicity of this method might lead to new processes in silicon semiconductor technology, as well as in high-purity silicon production. The methodology may be applicable to electrochemical processing of a wide variety of insulating materials, provided that the electrolyte dissolves the appropriate constituent ion(s) of the material."
1592,Chip and solution detection of DNA hybridization using a luminescent zwitterionic polythiophene derivative,2003-05-18,"Electronic polymers in aqueous media may offer bioelectronic detection of biospecific interactions. Here we report a fluorometric DNA hybridization detection method based on non-covalent coupling of DNA to a water-soluble zwitterionic polythiophene derivative. Introduction of a single-stranded oligonucleotide will induce a planar polymer and aggregation of the polymer chains, detected as a decrease of the intensity and a red-shift of the fluorescence. On addition of a complementary oligonucleotide, the intensity of the emitted light is increased and blue-shifted. The detection limit of this method is at present ∼10−11 moles. The method is highly sequence specific, and a single-nucleotide mismatch can be detected within five minutes without using any denaturation steps. The interaction with DNA and the optical phenomena persists when the polymer is deposited and patterned on a surface. This offers a novel way to create DNA chips without using covalent attachment of the receptor or labelling of the analyte."
1593,A stable quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell with an amphiphilic ruthenium sensitizer and polymer gel electrolyte,2003-05-18,"Dye-sensitized nanocrystalline solar cells (DSC) have received considerable attention as a cost-effective alternative to conventional solar cells. One of the main factors that has hampered widespread practical use of DSC is the poor thermostability encountered so far with these devices. Here we show a DSC with unprecedented stable performance under both thermal stress and soaking with light, matching the durability criteria applied to silicon solar cells for outdoor applications. The cell uses the amphiphilic ruthenium sensitizer cis-RuLL′(SCN)2 (L = 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine, L′ = 4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bipyridine) in conjunction with a quasi-solid-state polymer gel electrolyte, reaching an efficiency of >6% in full sunlight (air mass 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). A convenient and versatile new route is reported for the synthesis of the heteroleptic ruthenium complex, which plays a key role in achieving the high-temperature stability. Ultramicroelectrode voltammetric measurements show that the triiodide/iodide couple can perform charge transport freely in the polymer gel. The cell sustained heating for 1,000 h at 80 °C, maintaining 94% of its initial performance. The device also showed excellent stability under light soaking at 55 °C for 1,000 h in a solar simulator (100 mW cm−2) equipped with a ultraviolet filter. The present findings should foster widespread practical application of dye-sensitized solar cells."
1594,Novel approaches to polymer blends based on polymer nanoparticles,2003-05-11,"Polymer layers can exhibit significantly improved performances if they possess a multicomponent phase-separated morphology. We present two approaches to control the dimensions of phase separation in thin polymer-blend layers; both rely on polymer nanospheres prepared by the miniemulsion process. In the first approach, heterophase solid layers are prepared from an aqueous dispersion containing nanoparticles of two polymers, whereas in the second approach, both polymers are already contained in each individual nanoparticle. In both cases, the upper limit for the dimension of phase separation is determined by the size of the individual nanoparticles, which can be adjusted down to a few tens of nanometres. We also show that the efficiencies of solar cells using two-component particles are comparable to those of devices prepared from solution at comparable illumination conditions, and that they are not affected by the choice of solvent used in the miniemulsion process."
1595,Wigner defects bridge the graphite gap,2003-04-13,"We present findings on the structure, energies and behaviour of defects in irradiated graphitic carbon materials. Defect production due to high-energy nuclear radiations experienced in graphite moderators is generally associated with undesirable changes in internal energy, microstructure and physical properties—the so-called Wigner effect. On the flip side, the controlled introduction and ability to handle such defects in the electron beam is considered a desirable way to engineer the properties of carbon nanostructures. In both cases, the atomic-level details of structure and interaction are only just beginning to be understood. Here, using a model system of crystalline graphite, we show from first-principles calculations, new details in the behaviour of vacancy and interstitial defects. We identify a prominent barrier-state to energy release, reveal a surprising ability of vacancy defects to bridge the widely spaced atomic layers, and discuss physical property and microstructure changes during irradiation, including interactions with dislocations."
1596,Biology of TiO,2003-04-13,"Emerging areas of nanotechnology hold the promise of overcoming the limitations of existing technologies for intracellular manipulation. These new developments provide approaches for the creation of chemical–biological hybrid nanocomposites that can be introduced into cells and subsequently used to initiate intracellular processes or biochemical reactions. Such nanocomposites would advance medical biotechnology, just as they are improving microarray technology and imaging in biology and medicine, and introducing new possibilities in chemistry and material sciences. Here we describe the behaviour of 45-Å nanoparticles of titanium dioxide semiconductor combined with oligonucleotide DNA into nanocomposites in vivo and in vitro. These nanocomposites not only retain the intrinsic photocatalytic capacity of TiO2 and the bioactivity of the oligonucleotide DNA (covalently attached to the TiO2 nanoparticle), but also possess the chemically and biologically unique new property of a light-inducible nucleic acid endonuclease, which could become a new tool for gene therapy."
1597,DNA-assisted dispersion and separation of carbon nanotubes,2003-04-06,"Carbon nanotubes are man-made one-dimensional carbon crystals with different diameters and chiralities. Owing to their superb mechanical and electrical properties, many potential applications have been proposed for them. However, polydispersity and poor solubility in both aqueous and non-aqueous solution impose a considerable challenge for their separation and assembly, which is required for many applications. Here we report our finding of DNA-assisted dispersion and separation of carbon nanotubes. Bundled single-walled carbon nanotubes are effectively dispersed in water by their sonication in the presence of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Optical absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements provide evidence for individually dispersed carbon nanotubes. Molecular modelling suggests that ssDNA can bind to carbon nanotubes through π-stacking, resulting in helical wrapping to the surface. The binding free energy of ssDNA to carbon nanotubes rivals that of two nanotubes for each other. We also demonstrate that DNA-coated carbon nanotubes can be separated into fractions with different electronic structures by ion-exchange chromatography. This finding links one of the central molecules in biology to a technologically very important nanomaterial, and opens the door to carbon-nanotube-based applications in biotechnology."
1598,Molecular nanosprings in spider capture-silk threads,2003-03-23,"Spider capture silk is a natural material that outperforms almost any synthetic material in its combination of strength and elasticity. The structure of this remarkable material is still largely unknown, because spider-silk proteins have not been crystallized. Capture silk is the sticky spiral in the webs of orb-weaving spiders. Here we are investigating specifically the capture spiral threads from Araneus, an ecribellate orb-weaving spider. The major protein of these threads is flagelliform protein, a variety of silk fibroin. We present models for molecular and supramolecular structures of flagelliform protein, derived from amino acid sequences, force spectroscopy (molecular pulling) and stretching of bulk capture web. Pulling on molecules in capture-silk fibres from Araneus has revealed rupture peaks due to sacrificial bonds, characteristic of other self-healing biomaterials. The overall force changes are exponential for both capture-silk molecules and intact strands of capture silk."
1599,Chemisorbed poly(propylene sulphide)-based copolymers resist biomolecular interactions,2003-03-23,"Alkanethiolates have been widely used as chemisorbates to modify gold surfaces, in spite of their relatively poor oxidative stability. We introduce gold-chemisorbing block copolymers bearing an anchoring block of poly(propylene sulphide) (PPS), selected in the expectation of greater stability. These materials offer a more robust approach to surface modification of gold. As an example, a triblock copolymer with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) was selected, with the goal of minimizing biological adsorption and adhesion. The copolymer PEG17-bl-PPS25-bl-PEG9 chemisorbed to form a dense monolayer of 226 ± 26 ng cm−2, ∼2.2 nm thick. The copolymeric adlayer was much more stable to oxidation than commonly used alkanethiolates. Its presence greatly reduced protein adsorption (>95%), even after exposure to whole blood serum (>55 mg ml−1), as well as cell adhesion over long culture durations (>97%). PPS-containing copolymers are an attractive alternative to alkanethiolates, and PEG-bl-PPS-bl-PEG presents a powerful example for use in biodiagnostic and bioanalytical devices."
1600,Chaotic mixing in three-dimensional microvascular networks fabricated by direct-write assembly,2003-03-23,"The creation of geometrically complex fluidic devices is a subject of broad fundamental and technological interest. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) microvascular networks through direct-write assembly of a fugitive organic ink. This approach yields a pervasive network of smooth cylindrical channels (∼10–300 μm) with defined connectivity. Square-spiral towers, isolated within this vascular network, promote fluid mixing through chaotic advection. These vertical towers give rise to dramatic improvements in mixing relative to simple straight (1D) and square-wave (2D) channels while significantly reducing the device planar footprint. We envisage that 3D microvascular networks will provide an enabling platform for a wide array of fluidic-based applications."
1601,Nanochemistry at the atomic scale revealed in hydrogen-induced semiconductor surface metallization,2003-03-16,"Passivation of semiconductor surfaces against chemical attack can be achieved by terminating the surface-dangling bonds with a monovalent atom such as hydrogen. Such passivation invariably leads to the removal of all surface states in the bandgap, and thus to the termination of non-metallic surfaces. Here we report the first observation of semiconductor surface metallization induced by atomic hydrogen. This result, established by using photo-electron and photo-absorption spectroscopies and scanning tunnelling techniques, is achieved on a Si-terminated cubic silicon carbide (SiC) surface. It results from competition between hydrogen termination of surface-dangling bonds and hydrogen-generated steric hindrance below the surface. Understanding the ingredient for hydrogen-stabilized metallization directly impacts the ability to eliminate electronic defects at semiconductor interfaces critical for microelectronics, provides a means to develop electrical contacts on high-bandgap chemically passive materials, particularly for interfacing with biological systems, and gives control of surfaces for lubrication, for example of nanomechanical devices."
1602,Structural phase transition at the percolation threshold in epitaxial (La,2003-03-16,"'Colossal magnetoresistance' in perovskite manganites such as La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 (LCMO), is caused by the interplay of ferro-paramagnetic, metal–insulator and structural phase transitions. Moreover, different electronic phases can coexist on a very fine scale resulting in percolative electron transport. Here we report on (LCMO)1–x:(MgO)x (0 < x ≤ 0.8) epitaxial nano-composite films in which the structure and magnetotransport properties of the manganite nanoclusters can be tuned by the tensile stress originating from the MgO second phase. With increasing x, the lattice of LCMO was found to expand, yielding a bulk tensile strain. The largest colossal magnetoresistance of 105% was observed at the percolation threshold in the conductivity at xc ≈ 0.3, which is coupled to a structural phase transition from orthorhombic (0 < x ≤ 0.1) to rhombohedral R3̄c structure (0.33 ≤ x ≤ 0.8). An increase of the Curie temperature for the R3̄c phase was observed. These results may provide a general method for controlling the magnetotransport properties of manganite-based composite films by appropriate choice of the second phase."
1603,Linear assemblies of nanoparticles electrostatically organized on DNA scaffolds,2003-03-09,"A significant challenge faced in the use of nanoscale building blocks is developing parallel methods for interconnecting and patterning assemblies of the individual components. Molecular or polymeric scaffolds hold promise as a means of preparing closely spaced, specifically arranged nanoscale assemblies. Here we show how a biopolymer, DNA, can be used as a scaffold for the assembly of extended, close-packed, ligand-stabilized metal nanoparticle structures, including several desirable architectures (such as lines, ribbons, and branches). Electrostatic binding of ligand-stabilized nanoparticles to the DNA backbone results in extended linear chain-like structures, ribbon-like structures composed of parallel nanoparticle chains, and branched structures. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy shows that the particles are evenly spaced, separated only by the 15 Å imposed by the intervening ligand shell. These studies demonstrate that biomolecular nanolithography (the arrangement of nanoscale building blocks on biomolecular scaffolds) is a viable approach to interconnecting individual devices into extended, closely spaced assemblies."
1604,Optically induced multispin entanglement in a semiconductor quantum well,2003-02-23,"According to quantum mechanics, a many-particle system is allowed to exhibit non-local behaviour, in that measurements performed on one of the particles can affect a second one that is far away. These so-called entangled states are crucial for the implementation of most quantum information protocols and, in particular, gates for quantum computation. Here we use ultrafast optical pulses and coherent techniques to create and control spin-entangled states in an ensemble of non-interacting electrons bound to donors (at least three) and at least two Mn2+ ions in a CdTe quantum well. Our method, relying on the exchange interaction between localized excitons and paramagnetic impurities, can in principle be applied to entangle an arbitrarily large number of spins."
1605,Synthesis of cubic zirconium and hafnium nitride having Th,2003-02-23,"High-pressure synthesis is a powerful method for the preparation of novel materials with high elastic moduli and hardness. Additionally, such materials may exhibit interesting thermal, optoelectronic, semiconductuing, magnetic or superconducting properties. Here, we report on the high-pressure synthesis of zirconium and hafnium nitrides with the stoichiometry M3N4, where M = Zr, Hf. Synthesis experiments were performed in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell at pressures up to 18 GPa and temperatures up to 3,000 K. We observed formation of cubic Zr3N4 and Hf3N4 (c-M3N4) with a Th3P4-structure, where M-cations are eightfold coordinated by N anions. The c-M3N4 phases are the first binary nitrides with such a high coordination number. Both compounds exhibit high bulk moduli around 250 GPa, which indicates high hardness. Moreover, the new nitrides, c-Zr3N4 and c-Hf3N4, may be the first members of a larger group of transition metal and/or lanthanide nitrides with interesting ferromagnetic or superconducting behaviour."
1606,Peptides with selective affinity for carbon nanotubes,2003-02-16,"Because of their extraordinary electronic and mechanical properties, carbon nanotubes have great potential as materials for applications ranging from molecular electronics to ultrasensitive biosensors. Biological molecules interacting with carbon nanotubes provide them with specific chemical handles that would make several of these applications possible. Here we use phage display to identify peptides with selective affinity for carbon nanotubes. Binding specificity has been confirmed by demonstrating direct attachment of nanotubes to phage and free peptides immobilized on microspheres. Consensus binding sequences show a motif rich in histidine and tryptophan, at specific locations. Our analysis of peptide conformations shows that the binding sequence is flexible and folds into a structure matching the geometry of carbon nanotubes. The hydrophobic structure of the peptide chains suggests that they act as symmetric detergents."
1607,A nanoporous molecular magnet with reversible solvent-induced mechanical and magnetic properties,2003-02-16,"Interest in metal–organic open-framework structures has increased enormously in the past few years because of the potential benefits of using crystal engineering techniques to yield nanoporous materials with predictable structures and interesting properties. Here we report a new efficient methodology for the preparation of metal–organic open-framework magnetic structures based on the use of a persistent organic free radical (PTMTC), functionalized with three carboxylic groups. Using this approach, we create an open-framework structure Cu3(PTMTC)2(py)6(CH3CH2OH)2(H2O), which we call MOROF-1, combining very large pores (2.8–3.1 nm) with bulk magnetic ordering. MOROF-1 shows a reversible and highly selective solvent-induced 'shrinking–breathing' process involving large volume changes (25–35%) that strongly influence the magnetic properties of the material. This magnetic sponge-like behaviour could be the first stage of a new route towards magnetic solvent sensors."
1608,Identification of novel compositions of ferromagnetic shape-memory alloys using composition spreads,2003-02-02,"Exploration of new ferroic (ferroelectric, ferromagnetic or ferroelastic) materials continues to be a central theme in condensed matter physics and to drive advances in key areas of technology. Here, using thin-film composition spreads, we have mapped the functional phase diagram of the Ni–Mn–Ga system whose Heusler composition Ni2MnGa is a well known ferromagnetic shape-memory alloy. A characterization technique that allows detection of martensitic transitions by visual inspection was combined with quantitative magnetization mapping using scanning SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) microscopy. We find that a large, previously unexplored region outside the Heusler composition contains reversible martensites that are also ferromagnetic. A clear relationship between magnetization and the martensitic transition temperature is observed, revealing a strong thermodynamical coupling between magnetism and martensitic instability across a large fraction of the phase diagram."
1609,Tunable subpicosecond optoelectronic transduction in superlattices of self-assembled ErAs nanoislands,2003-01-26,"In applications as diverse as fibre-optic communications and time-domain or terahertz spectroscopy, researchers are keen on ultrafast optoelectronic transducers that can be tailored to specific needs. The molecular beam epitaxy of photoconductors composed of equidistant layers of self-assembled ErAs-islands in a III–V semiconductor matrix, which act as efficient non-radiative carrier capture sites, enables this flexibility. Here, photocurrent autocorrelation techniques are applied to metal–semiconductor–metal photodetectors patterned on ErAs:GaAs superlattices. The experiments demonstrate that the electrical response speed can be conveniently tuned over at least two orders of magnitude starting from 190 fs by increasing the thickness of the GaAs spacer separating adjacent ErAs layers. The same concept is applied to the narrower bandgap InGaAs matrix. We demonstrate an electron lifetime of approximately 1 ps for this material. This brings closer the prospect of implementing terahertz technology at the important optical communication wavelengths of 1.3 and 1.55 μm."
1610,"Fully reversible, dislocation-based compressive deformation of Ti",2003-01-26,"Dislocation-based deformation in crystalline solids is almost always plastic. Here we show that polycrystalline samples of Ti3SiC2 loaded cyclically at room temperature, in compression, to stresses up to 1 GPa, fully recover on the removal of the load, while dissipating about 25% (0.7 MJ m−3) of the mechanical energy. The stress–strain curves outline fully reversible, rate-independent, closed hysteresis loops that are strongly influenced by grain size, with the energy dissipated being significantly larger in the coarse-grained material. At temperatures greater than 1,000 °C, the loops are open, the response is strain-rate dependent, and cyclic hardening is observed. This hitherto unreported phenomenon is attributed to the reversible formation and annihilation of incipient kink bands at room-temperature deformation. At higher temperatures, the incipient kink bands dissociate and coalesce to form regular irreversible kink bands. The loss factor for Ti3SiC2 is higher than most woods, and comparable to polypropylene and nylon. The technological implications of having a stiff, lightweight machinable ceramic that can dissipate up to 25% of the mechanical energy per cycle are discussed."
1611,The development of grain-orientation-dependent residual stressess in a cyclically deformed alloy,2003-01-19,"There have been numerous efforts to understand and control the resistance of materials to fracture by repeated or cyclic stresses. The micromechanical behaviours, particularly the distributions of stresses on the scale of grain size during or after mechanical or electrical fatigue, are crucial to a full understanding of the damage mechanisms in these materials. Whether a large microstress develops during cyclic deformation with a small amount of monotonic strain but a large amount of accumulated strain remains an open question. Here, we report a neutron diffraction investigation of the development of intergranular stresses, which vary as a function of grain orientations, in 316 stainless steel during high-cycle fatigue. We found that a large intergranular stress developed before cracks started to appear. With further increase of fatigue cycles, the intergranular stress decreased, while the elastic intragranular stored energy continued to grow. One implication of our findings is that the ratio between the intergranular and intragranular stored energies during various stages of fatigue deformation may validate the damage mechanism and can be used as a fingerprint for monitoring the state of fatigue damage in materials."
1612,Microassembly of semiconductor three-dimensional photonic crystals,2003-01-12,"Electronic devices and their highly integrated components formed from semiconductor crystals contain complex three-dimensional (3D) arrangements of elements and wiring. Photonic crystals, being analogous to semiconductor crystals, are expected to require a 3D structure to form successful optoelectronic devices. Here, we report a novel fabrication technology for a semiconductor 3D photonic crystal by uniting integrated circuit processing technology with micromanipulation. Four- to twenty-layered (five periods) crystals, including one with a controlled defect, for infrared wavelengths of 3–4.5 μm, were integrated at predetermined positions on a chip (structural error <50 nm). Numerical calculations revealed that a transmission peak observed at the upper frequency edge of the bandgap originated from the excitation of a resonant guided mode in the defective layers. Despite their importance, detailed discussions on the defective modes of 3D photonic crystals for such short wavelengths have not been reported before. This technology offers great potential for the production of optical wavelength photonic crystal devices."
1613,A new phase diagram for layered antiferromagnetic films,2003-01-12,"Magnetic multilayer films provide convenient model systems for studying the physics of antiferromagnetic films and surfaces. Here we report on the magnetic reversal and domain structure in antiferromagnetically coupled Co/Pt multilayers that are isomorphic to layered antiferromagnetic films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We observe two distinct remanent states and reversal modes of the system. In mode 1 the magnetization in each layer reverses independently, producing an antiferromagnetic remanent state that shows full lateral correlation and vertical anticorrelation across the interlayers. In mode 2 the reversal in adjacent layers is locally synchronized with a remanent state that is vertically correlated but laterally anticorrelated in ferromagnetic stripe domains. Theoretical energy calculations of the two ground states identify a new phase boundary that is in good agreement with our experimental results."
1614,A highly crystalline layered silicate with three-dimensionally microporous layers,2002-12-22,"Layered silicates with three-dimensional microporosity within the layers have the potential to enable new applications in catalysis, adsorption and ion-exchange. Until now no such materials have been reported. However, here we present the synthesis and structure of AMH-3, a silicate with three-dimensionally microporous layers, obtained in high purity and crystallinity. AMH-3 is composed of silicate layers containing eight-membered rings in all three principal crystal directions, and spaced by strontium cations, sodium cations and water molecules. Because of its three-dimensional pore structure, acid and thermal stability, this layered material could find applications in polymer–silicate composites for membrane applications, for synthesis of combined microporous–mesoporous materials, and for the formation of new zeolites and microporous films. Its existence also opens new possibilities for the synthesis of other layered silicates with multidimensional microporous framework layers."
1615,Dynamics of ferroelastic domains in ferroelectric thin films,2002-12-22,"Dynamics of domain interfaces in a broad range of functional thin-film materials is an area of great current interest. In ferroelectric thin films, a significantly enhanced piezoelectric response should be observed if non-180° domain walls were to switch under electric field excitation. However, in continuous thin films they are clamped by the substrate, and therefore their contribution to the piezoelectric response is limited. In this paper we show that when the ferroelectric layer is patterned into discrete islands using a focused ion beam, the clamping effect is significantly reduced, thereby facilitating the movement of ferroelastic walls. Piezo-response scanning force microscopy images of such islands in PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films clearly point out that the 90° domain walls can move. Capacitors 1 μm2 show a doubling of the remanent polarization at voltages higher than ∼15 V, associated with 90° domain switching, coupled with a d33 piezoelectric coefficient of ∼250 pm V−1 at remanence, which is approximately three times the predicted value of 87 pm V−1 for a single domain single crystal."
1616,Single-wall carbon nanotubes as attractive toughening agents in alumina-based nanocomposites,2002-12-15,"The extraordinary mechanical, thermal and electrical properties of carbon nanotubes have prompted intense research into a wide range of applications in structural materials, electronics, chemical processing and energy management. Attempts have been made to develop advanced engineering materials with improved or novel properties through the incorporation of carbon nanotubes in selected matrices (polymers, metals and ceramics). But the use of carbon nanotubes to reinforce ceramic composites has not been very successful; for example, in alumina-based systems only a 24% increase in toughness has been obtained so far. Here we demonstrate their potential use in reinforcing nanocrystalline ceramics. We have fabricated fully dense nanocomposites of single-wall carbon nanotubes with nanocrystalline alumina (Al2O3) matrix at sintering temperatures as low as 1,150 °C by spark-plasma sintering. A fracture toughness of 9.7 MPa m½, nearly three times that of pure nanocrystalline alumina, can be achieved."
1617,Complex dewetting scenarios captured by thin-film models,2002-12-15,"In the course of miniaturization of electronic and microfluidic devices, reliable predictions of the stability of ultrathin films have a strategic role for design purposes. Consequently, efficient computational techniques that allow for a direct comparison with experiment become increasingly important. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that the full complex spatial and temporal evolution of the rupture of ultrathin films can be modelled in quantitative agreement with experiment. We accomplish this by combining highly controlled experiments on different film-rupture patterns with computer simulations using novel numerical schemes for thin-film equations. For the quantitative comparison of the pattern evolution in both experiment and simulation we introduce a novel pattern analysis method based on Minkowski measures. Our results are fundamental for the development of efficient tools capable of describing essential aspects of thin-film flow in technical systems."
1618,Hierarchical structure formation and pattern replication induced by an electric field,2002-12-08,"Several techniques based on soft lithography have emerged to replicate micrometre-sized patterns. Similar to most other lithographic methods, these techniques structure a single layer of photo resist. For many applications, however, it is desirable to control the spatial arrangement of more than one component. With traditional methods, this requires an iterative, multistep procedure, making the replication process more complex and less reliable. Here, a replication process is described where multiple materials are processed simultaneously. Using a bilayer formed by two different polymers, electrohydrodynamic instabilities at both polymer surfaces produce a hierarchic lateral structure that exhibits two independent characteristic dimensions. A lateral modulation of the electric field enables replication with a resolution down to 100 nanometres. This approach might provide a simple strategy for large-area, sub-100-nanometre lithography."
1619,Novel Ti-base nanostructure–dendrite composite with enhanced plasticity,2002-12-08,"Single-phase nanocrystalline materials undergo inhomogeneous plastic deformation under loading at room temperature, which results in a very limited plastic strain (smaller than 0–3%). The materials therefore display low ductility, leading to catastrophic failure, which severely restricts their application. Here, we present a new in situ-formed nanostructured matrix/ductile dendritic phase composite microstructure for Ti-base alloys, which exhibits up to 14.5% compressive plastic strain at room temperature. The new composite microstructure was synthesized on the basis of the appropriate choice of composition, and by using well-controlled solidification conditions. Deformation occurs partially through dislocation movement in dendrites, and partially through a shear-banding mechanism in the nanostructured matrix. The dendrites act as obstacles restricting the excessive deformation by isolating the highly localized shear bands in small, discrete inter-dendritic regions, and contribute to the plasticity. We suggest that microscale ductile crystalline phases might therefore be used to toughen nanostructured materials."
1620,"DNA-modified nanocrystalline diamond thin-films as stable, biologically active substrates",2002-11-24,"Diamond, because of its electrical and chemical properties, may be a suitable material for integrated sensing and signal processing. But methods to control chemical or biological modifications on diamond surfaces have not been established. Here, we show that nanocrystalline diamond thin-films covalently modified with DNA oligonucleotides provide an extremely stable, highly selective platform in subsequent surface hybridization processes. We used a photochemical modification scheme to chemically modify clean, H-terminated nanocrystalline diamond surfaces grown on silicon substrates, producing a homogeneous layer of amine groups that serve as sites for DNA attachment. After linking DNA to the amine groups, hybridization reactions with fluorescently tagged complementary and non-complementary oligonucleotides showed no detectable non-specific adsorption, with extremely good selectivity between matched and mismatched sequences. Comparison of DNA-modified ultra-nanocrystalline diamond films with other commonly used surfaces for biological modification, such as gold, silicon, glass and glassy carbon, showed that diamond is unique in its ability to achieve very high stability and sensitivity while also being compatible with microelectronics processing technologies. These results suggest that diamond thin-films may be a nearly ideal substrate for integration of microelectronics with biological modification and sensing."
1621,Ordered nanoparticle arrays formed on engineered chaperonin protein templates,2002-11-24,"Traditional methods for fabricating nanoscale arrays are usually based on lithographic techniques. Alternative new approaches rely on the use of nanoscale templates made of synthetic or biological materials. Some proteins, for example, have been used to form ordered two-dimensional arrays. Here, we fabricated nanoscale ordered arrays of metal and semiconductor quantum dots by binding preformed nanoparticles onto crystalline protein templates made from genetically engineered hollow double-ring structures called chaperonins. Using structural information as a guide, a thermostable recombinant chaperonin subunit was modified to assemble into chaperonins with either 3 nm or 9 nm apical pores surrounded by chemically reactive thiols. These engineered chaperonins were crystallized into two-dimensional templates up to 20 μm in diameter. The periodic solvent-exposed thiols within these crystalline templates were used to size-selectively bind and organize either gold (1.4, 5 or 10nm) or CdSe–ZnS semiconductor (4.5 nm) quantum dots into arrays. The order within the arrays was defined by the lattice of the underlying protein crystal. By combining the self-assembling properties of chaperonins with mutations guided by structural modelling, we demonstrate that quantum dots can be manipulated using modified chaperonins and organized into arrays for use in next-generation electronic and photonic devices."
1622,High-κ dielectrics for advanced carbon-nanotube transistors and logic gates,2002-11-17,"The integration of materials having a high dielectric constant (high-κ) into carbon-nanotube transistors promises to push the performance limit for molecular electronics. Here, high-κ (∼25) zirconium oxide thin-films (∼8 nm) are formed on top of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes by atomic-layer deposition and used as gate dielectrics for nanotube field-effect transistors. The p-type transistors exhibit subthreshold swings of S ∼ 70 mV per decade, approaching the room-temperature theoretical limit for field-effect transistors. Key transistor performance parameters, transconductance and carrier mobility reach 6,000 S m−1 (12 μS per tube) and 3,000 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively. N-type field-effect transistors obtained by annealing the devices in hydrogen exhibit S ∼ 90 mV per decade. High voltage gains of up to 60 are obtained for complementary nanotube-based inverters. The atomic-layer deposition process affords gate insulators with high capacitance while being chemically benign to nanotubes, a key to the integration of advanced dielectrics into molecular electronics."
1623,Experimentally realizable devices for controlling the motion of magnetic flux quanta in anisotropic superconductors,2002-10-27,"A new generation of microscopic ratchet systems is currently being developed for controlling the motion of electrons and fluxons, as well as for particle separation and electrophoresis. Virtually all of these use static spatially asymmetric potential energies to control transport properties. Here we propose completely new types of ratchet-like systems that do not require fixed spatially asymmetric potentials in the samples. As specific examples of this novel general class of ratchets, we propose devices that control the motion of flux quanta in superconductors and could address a central problem in many superconducting devices; namely, the removal of trapped magnetic flux that produces noise. In layered superconductors there are two interpenetrating perpendicular vortex lattices consisting of Josephson vortices (JVs) and pancake vortices (PVs). We show that, owing to the JV–PV mutual interaction and asymmetric driving, the a.c. motion of JVs and/or PVs can provide a net d.c. vortex current. This controllable vortex motion can be used for making pumps, diodes and lenses of quantized magnetic flux. These proposed devices sculpt the microscopic magnetic flux profile by simply modifying the time dependence of the a.c. drive, without the need for samples with static pinning—for example, without lithography or irradiation."
1624,Mutual passivation of electrically active and isovalent impurities,2002-10-20,"The alloy GaNx As1−x (with x typically less than 0.05) is a novel semiconductor that has many interesting electronic properties because of the nitrogen-induced dramatic modifications of the conduction band structure of the host material (GaAs). Here we demonstrate the existence of an entirely new effect in the GaNx As1−x alloy system in which the Si donor in the substitututional Ga site (SiGa) and the isovalent atom N in the As sublattice (NAs) passivate each other's electronic activity. This mutual passivation occurs in Si-doped GaNx As1−x through the formation of nearest-neighbour SiGa –NAs pairs and is thermally stable up to 950 °C. Consequently, Si doping in GaNx As1−x under equilibrium conditions results in a highly resistive GaNx As1−x layer with the fundamental bandgap governed by a net 'active' N, roughly equal to the total N content minus the Si concentration. Such mutual passivation is expected to be a general phenomenon for electrically active dopants and localized state impurities that can form nearest-neighbour pairs."
1625,Molecular design of strong single-wall carbon nanotube/polyelectrolyte multilayer composites,2002-10-13,"The mechanical failure of hybrid materials made from polymers and single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) is primarily attributed to poor matrix–SWNT connectivity and severe phase segregation. Both problems can be successfully mitigated when the SWNT composite is made following the protocol of layer-by-layer assembly. This deposition technique prevents phase segregation of the polymer/SWNT binary system, and after subsequent crosslinking, the nanometre-scale uniform composite with SWNT loading as high as 50 wt% can be obtained. The free-standing SWNT/polyelectrolyte membranes delaminated from the substrate were found to be exceptionally strong with a tensile strength approaching that of hard ceramics. Because of the lightweight nature of SWNT composites, the prepared free-standing membranes can serve as components for a variety of long-lifetime devices."
1626,Phospholipid membranes as substrates for polymer adsorption,2002-10-01,"A largely unsolved problem in soft materials is how surface reconstruction competes with the rate of adsorption. Here, supported phospholipid bilayers of DMPC (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) were employed as substrates for the adsorption of a weak polyelectrolyte, polymethacrylic acid, whose time-dependent ratio of charged to uncharged functional groups served to probe the local dielectric environment. Chains that encountered sparsely covered surfaces spread to maximize the number of segment–surface contacts at rates independent of the molar mass (which was varied by a factor of 30), but dependent on the phase of the lipid bilayer, gel or liquid crystal. Surface reconstruction rather than molar mass of the adsorbing molecules seemed to determine the rate of spreading. The significance of these findings is the stark contrast with well-known views of polymer adsorption onto surfaces having structures that are 'frozen' and unresponsive, and is relevant not just from biological and biophysical standpoints, but also in the formulation of many cosmetics and pharmaceutical products."
1627,Electronically conductive phospho-olivines as lithium storage electrodes,2002-09-22,"Lithium transition metal phosphates have become of great interest as storage cathodes for rechargeable lithium batteries because of their high energy density, low raw materials cost, environmental friendliness and safety. Their key limitation has been extremely low electronic conductivity, until now believed to be intrinsic to this family of compounds. Here we show that controlled cation non-stoichiometry combined with solid-solution doping by metals supervalent to Li+ increases the electronic conductivity of LiFePO4 by a factor of ∼108. The resulting materials show near-theoretical energy density at low charge/discharge rates, and retain significant capacity with little polarization at rates as high as 6,000 mA g−1. In a conventional cell design, they may allow development of lithium batteries with the highest power density yet."
1628,Reversibly erasable nanoporous anti-reflection coatings from polyelectrolyte multilayers,2002-09-02,"For nearly two centuries, researchers have sought novel methods to increase light transmission in optical systems, as well as to eliminate unwanted reflections and glare. Anti-reflection coatings and surfaces have enabled the increasing performance demands of optical components fabricated from glass-based optical materials. With the current trend of technology moving towards optically transparent polymeric media and coatings, the need for anti-reflection technology and environmentally benign processing methods for polymeric materials independent of shape or size has become quite apparent. We describe an economical, aqueous-based process controlled at the molecular level that simultaneously coats all surfaces of almost any material. Systematically designed nanoporous polymer films are used, which are suitable for optical applications operating at both visible and near-infrared wavelengths. These high-efficiency anti-reflection coatings are created from phase-separated polyelectrolyte multilayer films that undergo a reversible pH-induced swelling transition. Furthermore, such films, easily patterned by an inkjet printing technique, possess potential for pH-responsive biomaterial and membrane applications."
1629,Dislocation processes in the deformation of nanocrystalline aluminium by molecular-dynamics simulation,2002-09-02,"The mechanical behaviour of nanocrystalline materials (that is, polycrystals with a grain size of less than 100 nm) remains controversial. Although it is commonly accepted that the intrinsic deformation behaviour of these materials arises from the interplay between dislocation and grain-boundary processes, little is known about the specific deformation mechanisms. Here we use large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations to elucidate this intricate interplay during room-temperature plastic deformation of model nanocrystalline Al microstructures. We demonstrate that, in contrast to coarse-grained Al, mechanical twinning may play an important role in the deformation behaviour of nanocrystalline Al. Our results illustrate that this type of simulation has now advanced to a level where it provides a powerful new tool for elucidating and quantifying–in a degree of detail not possible experimentally–the atomic-level mechanisms controlling the complex dislocation and grain-boundary processes in heavily deformed materials with a submicrometre grain size."
1630,Highest electron affinity as a predictor of cluster anion structures,2002-09-02,"Small clusters have a range of unique physical and chemical phenomena that are strongly size dependent. However, analysis of these phenomena often assumes that thermodynamic equilibrium conditions prevail. We compare experimentally measured and ab initio computed photoelectron spectra of bare and deuterated silicon cluster anions produced in a plasma environment. We find that the isomers detected experimentally are usually not the ground-state isomers, but metastable ones, which indicates that cluster relaxation is strongly limited kinetically by a dwell time that is much shorter than the relaxation time. We show that, under these conditions, the highest electron affinity replaces the traditional lowest total energy as the appropriate criterion for predicting isomer structures. These findings demonstrate that a stringent examination of non-equilibrium effects can be crucial for a correct analysis of cluster properties."
1631,Bridge-mediated hopping or superexchange electron-transfer processes in bis(triarylamine) systems,2002-09-02,"Hopping and superexchange are generally considered to be alternative electron-transfer mechanisms in molecular systems. In this work we used mixed-valence radical cations as model systems for the investigation of electron-transfer pathways. We show that substituents attached to a conjugated bridge connecting two triarylamine redox centres have a marked influence on the near-infrared absorption spectra of the corresponding cations. Spectral analysis, followed by evaluation of the electron-transfer parameters using the Generalized Mulliken–Hush theory and simulation of the potential energy surfaces, indicate that hopping and superexchange are not alternatives, but are both present in the radical cation with a dimethoxybenzene bridge. We found that the type of electron-transfer mechanism depends on the bridge-reorganization energy as well as on the bridge-state energy. Because superexchange and hopping follow different distance laws, our findings have implications for the design of new molecular and polymeric electron-transfer materials."
1632,Polymer-stabilized liquid crystal blue phases,2002-09-02,"Blue phases are types of liquid crystal phases that appear in a temperature range between a chiral nematic phase and an isotropic liquid phase. Because blue phases have a three-dimensional cubic structure with lattice periods of several hundred nanometres, they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the range of visible light corresponding to the cubic lattice. From the viewpoint of applications, although blue phases are of interest for fast light modulators or tunable photonic crystals, the very narrow temperature range, usually less than a few kelvin, within which blue phases exist has always been a problem. Here we show the stabilization of blue phases over a temperature range of more than 60 K including room temperature (260–326 K). Furthermore, we demonstrate an electro-optical switching with a response time of the order of 10−4 s for the stabilized blue phases at room temperature."
1633,Design and properties of co-continuous nanostructured polymers by reactive blending,2002-09-02,"With an annual production of hundreds of millions of tons, the few commodity polymers that dominate the plastics market cannot satisfy all the applications and expectations. In this context, the fabrication of thermodynamically stable polymer blends structured on submicrometre scales raises much hope, but poses significant scientific and industrial challenges. Here, we propose and demonstrate for an industrially relevant system, polyethylene and polyamide, that hitherto inaccessible co-continuous morphologies can be produced over a wide range of compositions by reactive blending. Paradoxically, the self-assembled structures are thermodynamically stable because of the molecular polydispersity inherent in the production method. These nanostructured materials present a unique combination of properties impossible to achieve with classical blends. This versatile, low-cost and simple strategy should be widely applicable."
